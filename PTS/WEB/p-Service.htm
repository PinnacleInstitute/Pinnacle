												calendars, meeting plans, goals, prospects, customers, classes, assessments,

												can also make assignments for those they mentor.<br>
												&nbsp;<br>
												<b>Goal Management System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides a goal management system for sales reps to better track 
												and accomplish their business objectives. Complex goals may contain multiple 
												tasks with detailed notes. Each goal and task includes projected vs. actual 
												completion dates and variance reporting. Sales reps may join a success track, 
												which is a set of goals predefined by the company or any other sales rep for a 
												specific business process. Each goal in the success track may include detailed 
												instructions with links to information pages and other support resources.<br>
												&nbsp;<br>
												<b>Calendaring System<br>
												</b>Each sales rep can have multiple public and private personal or group 
												calendars. They can also view multiple company calendars for conference calls 
												and other company events. The Pinnacle calendars go beyond a regular 
												appointment calendar to include dated information within the Pinnacle system 
												like goals due, classes, assessments and certifications completed, sales events 
												and sales activities, and project and task due dates. Available time slots may 
												be identified and taken by authorized users. Appointments may be recurring and 
												may include automated email reminders at a predefined time beforehand.<br>
												<br>
												<b>Meeting / Party Planning System<br>
												</b>A sales rep can create a detailed meeting plan (or party plan) for any 
												appointment on their calendar. A host / hostess can be specified and trained 
												for the meeting and an invitation can be created for emailing to the guests. 
												The invitation may be created from 25 different themes. The meeting planner can 
												include an unlimited number of guests and keeps track of the guest’s RSVPs. The 
												host also has secured access to the meeting planner to edit the invitation, 
												guest list and unlimited meeting/party notes. The meeting planner also tracks 
												guest attendance and sales if applicable.<br>
												&nbsp;<br>
												<b>Training and Development System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides a very robust Learning Management System. Pinnacle 
												provides interactive multimedia training with multiple lessons, downloadable 
												lesson documents, lesson quizzes, and student notes. Pinnacle also includes 
												course evaluations for users to rate the quality of the courses on a scale from 
												1-5 for the course content, presentation, presenter, and usefulness. Each 
												course receives a 1-5 star ranking for users to review the detailed ratings and 
												comments by other users. Users can print certificates of completion for 
												completed courses and certificates of achievement for passed courses.<br>
												<br>
												&nbsp;Company specific training can be produced and organized in company 
												folders. Pinnacle also includes a public course catalog with over $50,000 of 
												corporate training courses included for free in the monthly membership. Public 
												courses include professional, personal, academic and technical courses like 
												Computer Basics, How to use Windows, How to use the Internet, Microsoft Word, 
												Excel, Access, PowerPoint, and FrontPage, QuickBooks, and hundreds of others.<br>
												&nbsp;<br>
												<b>Assessment &amp; Certification System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides an Assessment Engine for defining custom assessments and 
												certifications. They may be skills assessments, diagnostic assessments that 
												provide a decision tree of situational questioning, prescriptive assessments 
												that recommend training courses based on the answers, or certifications on 
												product or process knowledge. Assessments and certifications can specify the 
												number of times it can be taken, the wait time between retakes, if the user can 
												view the answers, the passing grade, and how to calculate the final grade. The 
												questions may include multimedia audio or video clips. Users can print 
												certificates for passed certifications.<br>
												<br>
												<b>Marketing System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides a suite of marketing tools to help the sales rep find 
												qualified prospects. The sales rep can view the company’s published marketing 
												strategies. The company can define multiple lead capture web pages in multiple 
												languages that are professionally crafted to deliver a specific marketing 
												message to a target niche. Each lead page starts with a unique selling 
												proposition and the key benefits the target audience desires, followed by the 
												product features to build rationale, established credibility with affiliations, 
												approvals, certifications and testimonials, risk eliminating statements, and a 
												compelling reason to act now. A sales rep can promote the lead pages directly 
												in email to personal contacts or in advertising to attract qualified prospects. 
												The sales rep is automatically notified when the visitor starts viewing the 
												lead page and when they request more information. The requesting visitor is 
												automatically added to the Sales Management System as a new prospect. Newly 
												acquired leads (i.e. prospects) may be distributed to sales reps by the company 
												or any other sales rep. A sales rep can view the traffic statistics to see how 
												many times a lead page was viewed and responded to.<br>
												<br>
												The company can also define presentation websites in multiple languages for 
												each specific solution they offer. The presentation sites may consist of 
												multiple web pages to present detailed information about the value proposition. 
												A specific presentation site is sent to a prospect by the sales rep, who can 
												track when the visitor starts viewing the presentation site and exactly which 
												pages they have viewed.<br>
												<br>
												Pinnacle provides an Affiliate Management System to manage business partners 
												that service the same target market and provide customer referrals. The sales 
												rep can keep track of all the affiliate’s contact information and the agreed 
												upon terms for compensation. Each affiliate has his own links to the sales 
												rep’s lead pages that they can promote to their audience on web pages, customer 
												email lists, newsletters, etc. The system keeps track of which affiliates 
												referred which prospects. The affiliate can also login to a secured back-office 
												to view the referral statistics.<br>
												<br>
												Pinnacle fully supports permission marketing with the delivery of valuable 
												information in newsletters to people who have requested it. Marketing 
												newsletters can be created on specific topics related to the company’s value 
												proposition. Each newsletter has a lead page to promote the free subscription 
												to the valuable information. The system will automatically distribute the 
												newsletter back-issues on a predefined schedule to the new subscribers. This 
												permission marketing technique will help a sales rep develop a warm market of 
												potential prospects that aren’t quite ready to purchase yet.<br>
												<br>
												<b>Sales Management System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides a professional Sales Tracking and Reporting system that 
												tracks the progress of prospects within the steps of a sales process. It goes 
												well beyond a contact manager that just tracks contact information. The company 
												can define multiple sales campaigns with specific steps in the sales process. 
												The system will keep track of which step the prospect is at and the date 
												achieved. Each step of the sales process may include detailed information for 
												the sales rep like sales scripts, training or reference documents. The sales 
												rep can keep track of the next event that the prospect has agreed to like a 
												phone call or a meeting. The sales rep can keep unlimited notes for each 
												prospect to document all interaction. They can also attach important documents 
												to the prospect like applications, proposals and agreements. The sales rep can 
												send personal emails to a prospect and can select from email templates created 
												by the company or any other sales rep. The sales rep can create follow-up 
												events to keep track of the prospect’s important dates like birthdays, 
												anniversaries, expired contracts, etc. An inactive prospect is either closed 
												(yes), dead (no), or in fallback (stalled/maybe).<br>
												&nbsp;<br>
												The sale rep and their mentor can easily view a summary of all their active 
												prospects on the Sales Board Report. This report displays the total number of 
												prospects and their potential and current value for each step of the sales 
												process. This report gives a birds-eye-view of how well the sales rep is 
												filling the sales pipeline, how well they are moving prospects through the 
												pipeline and for which steps of the sales process they may need help. The sales 
												rep can also view reports on their scheduled sales events, stalled prospects, 
												prospects on the first step, closed prospects, sales activity notes, and 
												prospects distributed to others.&nbsp;<br>
												<br>
												<b>Customer Service System<br>
												</b>After a prospect is closed, they are automatically added to the Customer 
												Service System. Sales reps can keep unlimited notes to document all interaction 
												with the customer. They can also select a predefined set of goals for 
												themselves to accomplish with their new customers. The sales rep can create 
												follow-up events to keep track of the customer’s important dates like 
												birthdays, anniversaries, maintenance checkups, etc. The sales rep can send 
												personal emails to a customer and can select from email templates created by 
												the company or any other sales rep. They can also attach important documents to 
												the prospect like contract renewals.<br>
												<br>
												<b>Personal Resource Center<br>
												</b>Sales reps can create custom resources to be used by themselves or any 
												other sales rep. These custom resources include Success Tracks that are 
												predefined sets of goals for a specific business process. Success Tracks may be 
												goals for the sales rep personally or they may be goals to be accomplished by 
												the sale rep for a customer. The sales rep may also create custom email 
												templates with replaceable tags for personalization. The email templates may be 
												for lead page introductions, presentation site introductions, or general emails 
												to prospects. The sales rep can create custom information pages that can be 
												referenced within the steps of a success track or can be referenced directly by 
												a unique URL. The custom information pages are fully functional web pages and 
												can include links to other information pages and other Internet resources. The 
												sales rep can also upload their own documents to be accessed within the steps 
												of a success track or directly by a unique URL.<br>
												<br>
												<b>Collaboration / Communication<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides several collaboration and communication tools to assist 
												the sales rep and their support team. These tools include online discussion 
												boards and online chat rooms on any topic, telephone conference lines for up to 
												96 callers, electronic suggestion boxes that allow the sales rep to see the 
												status and response to their suggestion, and company defined surveys to collect 
												information from the sales field, customer base, or target market. The surveys 
												can be dynamically created by the company and they automatically calculate the 
												survey statistics.<br>
												<br>
												<b>Project Collaboration System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides a complete Project Management System for multiple people 
												to collaborate on a shared project. The project may have multiple phases and 
												can have unlimited tasks assigned to the various members of the project. Each 
												member can view the status and notes of all tasks and phases in the project. 
												The system tracks the projected vs. actual completion dates for the project, 
												phases and tasks. Time and expenses can also be tracked with each task and 
												rolled up to the phase and project. Each Phase and task can have unlimited 
												notes and attached documents. Each Project and phase has its own discussion 
												board and chat room. The projects can be assigned a specific security level to 
												control access. A project manager can view the “What’s New” report to see a 
												summary of all project activity.&nbsp;<br>
												<br>
												<b>Support Information System<br>
												</b>Pinnacle provides several tools to deliver support information to the sales 
												rep. These support tools include a company document search engine like Google 
												that allows the sales rep to search for any information by keyword. The sales 
												rep can also search the company’s knowledgebase of questions and answers with a 
												similar Google-like search engine or they can browse questions and answers by 
												topic. Company documents and questions and answers can be assigned a security 
												level to control access by, independent sales reps, employees, managers, and 
												executives.<br>
												<br>
												Pinnacle also provides shortcut links, similar to Windows shortcuts, for quick 
												access to any information including goals, classes, assessments, prospects, 
												customers, affiliates, support documents, attachment, projects, tasks and 
												success tracks.<br>
