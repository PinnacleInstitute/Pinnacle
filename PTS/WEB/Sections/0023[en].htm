<P><B>SECTION 1 – CORPORATE MISSION STATEMENT</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<BR>Pinnacle is solely dedicated to empowering individuals, families and small businesses to attain their dreams through the dissemination of&nbsp;knowledge, education and motivation via the Internet. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>SECTION 2 – INTRODUCTION</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>2.1 Policies Incorporated into Affiliate Agreement</B> 
<BR>These Policies and Procedures, in their present form and as amended from time to time at the sole discretion of Pinnacle Performance Institute (hereafter Pinnacle or the “Company”), are incorporated into, and form an integral part of the Pinnacle Affiliate Agreement. Throughout these Policies and Procedures, when the term “Agreement” is used, it collectively refers to the Pinnacle Affiliate Application and Agreement and these Policies and Procedures, if applicable. These documents are incorporated by reference into the Pinnacle Affiliate Agreement (all in their current form and as amended by Pinnacle). It is the responsibility of each Affiliate to read, understand, adhere to and ensure that he or she is aware of and operating under the most current version of these Policies and Procedures. 
<P><B>2.2 Purpose of Policies</B> 
<BR>Pinnacle is a direct sales company that markets training memberships to individuals, families, and small businesses through independent representatives referred herein as affiliates. It is important to understand that your success and the success of your fellow Affiliates is dependent upon the integrity of the men and women who market our products and services. To clearly define the relationship that exists between Affiliates and Pinnacle, and to explicitly set a standard for acceptable business conduct, Pinnacle has established the Agreement. 
<P>Pinnacle Affiliates are required to comply with all the Terms and Conditions set forth in the Agreement, which Pinnacle may amend at its sole discretion from time to time, as well as all federal, state and territorial laws governing their Pinnacle business and their conduct. 
<P>Pinnacle honors all federal, state, and local regulations governing good business practices and requires Pinnacle Affiliates to do the same. Because you may be unfamiliar with many of these standards of practice, it is very important that you read and abide by the Agreement. Please review the information in this manual carefully. It explains and governs the relationship between you as an Independent Affiliate and the Company. If you have any questions regarding any policy or rule, do not hesitate to seek an answer from anyone in your management team or Pinnacle. 
<P><B>2.3 - Changes to the Affiliate Agreement, Policies and Procedures, or Compensation Plan </B>
<BR>Because federal, state, territorial and local laws, as well as the business environment, periodically change, Pinnacle reserves the right to amend the Agreement and its prices in its sole and absolute discretion. By signing the Affiliate Agreement, an Affiliate agrees to abide by all amendments or modifications that Pinnacle elects to make. Notification of amendments shall be published in official Pinnacle materials and shall be effective upon the notification being published and sent to Affiliates and a certification in the files of Pinnacle that such change has been mailed to the Affiliates in general at the time of such mailing. The continuation of an Affiliate’s Pinnacle business, or an Affiliate’s acceptance of commissions or bonuses, constitutes acceptance of any and all amendments. 
<P><B>2.4 - Delays </B>
<BR>Pinnacle shall not be responsible for delays and failures in performance to its obligations when performance is made commercially impracticable due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control, this includes without limitation, strikes, labor difficulties, riot, war, fire, death, curtailment of a party’s source of supply, or government decrees or orders or other unforeseen causes. 
<P><B>2.5 - Policies and Provisions Severable </B>
<BR>If any provision of the Agreement, in its current form or as may be amended, is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, only the invalid portion(s) of the provision shall be severed and the remaining terms and provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) never comprised a part of the Agreement. 
<P><B>2.6 - Titles Not Substantive </B>
<BR>The titles and headings to these policies are for reference purposes only, and do not constitute, and shall not be construed as, substantive terms of these Policies. 
<P><B>2.7 - Waiver</B> 
<BR>The Company never gives up its right to insist on compliance with the Agreement and with the applicable laws governing the conduct of a business. No failure of Pinnacle to exercise any right or power under the Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by an Affiliate with any obligation or provision of the Agreement, and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms of the Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of Pinnacle’s right to demand exact compliance with the Agreement. Waiver by Pinnacle can be affected only in writing by an authorized officer of Pinnacle’s waiver of any particular breach by an Affiliate shall not affect or impair Pinnacle’s rights with respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations of any other Affiliate. Nor shall any delay or omission by Pinnacle to exercise any right arising from a breach affect or impair Pinnacle’s rights as to that or any subsequent breach. The existence of any claim or cause of action of an Affiliate against Pinnacle shall not constitute a defense to Pinnacle’s enforcement of any term or provision of the Agreement. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>

<P><B>SECTION 4 – OPERATING A PINNACLE BUSINESS</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>4.1 - Adherence to the Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan</B> 
<BR>Independent Representative (Affiliates) must adhere to the terms of the Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan as set forth in official Pinnacle literature. Affiliates shall not offer the Pinnacle opportunity through, or in combination with, any other system, program, or method of marketing other than that specifically stated in official Pinnacle literature. Affiliates shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Affiliates to participate in Pinnacle in any manner that varies from the program as set forth in official Pinnacle literature. Affiliates shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Affiliates to execute any agreement or contract other than official Pinnacle agreements, in order to become a Pinnacle Affiliate. Similarly, Affiliates shall not require or encourage other current or prospective Affiliates to make any purchase from, or payment to, any individual or other entity to participate in the Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan other than those purchases or payments identified as recommended or required in Pinnacle literature. 
<P><B>4.2- Advertising</B> 
<P><B>4.2.1 - ln General </B>
<BR>In the conduct of his or her business, the Affiliate shall safeguard and promote the reputation of Pinnacle and its services and products. The marketing and promotion of Pinnacle, the Pinnacle opportunity, the Marketing and Compensation Plan, and Pinnacle training services shall be consistent with the public interest, and must avoid all discourteous, deceptive, misleading, unethical or immoral conduct or practices. 
<BR>
<BR>To promote both the training services and the opportunity Pinnacle offers, Affiliates must use only the sales aids and support materials produced by Pinnacle or materials that have been reviewed and approved in writing by Pinnacle. 
<P><B>4.2.2 - Trademarks and Copyrights </B>
<BR>The name of Pinnacle and other names as may be adopted by Pinnacle are proprietary trade names, trademarks and service marks of Pinnacle As such, these marks are of great value to Pinnacle and are supplied to Affiliates for their use only in an expressly authorized manner. Use of the Pinnacle name on any item not produced by the company is prohibited except as approved in writing by Pinnacle. 
<BR>
<BR>All Affiliates may list themselves as an ”Independent Pinnacle Affiliate” in the white or yellow pages of the telephone directory under their own name, only. No Affiliate may place telephone directory display ads using Pinnacle’s name or logo as the primary identification. Affiliates may not answer the telephone by saying ”Pinnacle,” ”Pinnacle Incorporated,” or in any other manner that would lead the caller to believe that he or she has reached the corporate offices of Pinnacle. These same policies apply to the Internet. Pinnacle’s Affiliates are not permitted to use Pinnacle’s trade name or any of its trademarks on their business or personal stationary or checking accounts as the primary identification. However, Affiliates may imprint their stationary and business checks as being one of the following: 
<BR>· Sales Representative 
<BR>· Independent Affiliate 
<BR>· Executive Affiliate (if qualified) 
<BR>· Executive Founder (if qualified) 
<BR>· Founding Affiliate (if qualified) 
<P><B>4.2.3 - Media and Media Inquiries </B>
<BR>Affiliates are prohibited from responding to media inquiries regarding Pinnacle, its training services, or their independent Pinnacle business. All inquiries by any media must immediately be referred to Pinnacle’s Public Relations Department. Pinnacle employs a professional staff that is responsible for replying to these types of inquiries. This policy is designed to assure accurate and consistent information to the public, as well as a proper public image. 
<P><B>4.2.4 - Recruiting Materials </B>
<BR>Affiliates are not prohibited from developing advertisements or promotional materials for the purpose of recruiting Affiliates and Customers. Such materials are limited to advertisements for selling products or services and recruiting, and include advertisements, voice messages, Fax-on-Demand, signage, printed correspondence used in mass-mailings or distribution, and electronic distribution such as e-mail and fax-blasts. All such materials must be pre-approved in writing by Pinnacle. 
<BR>However, such material may not contain misleading, unethical or exaggerated information and must specifically adhere to the guidelines set forth in Section 4.2.5 below, as well as those guidelines expressed elsewhere in these Policies and Procedures. All such materials are in constant review by Pinnacle’s Ethics and Compliance Department, as well as state and federal regulatory agencies. Violation of any of Pinnacle’s guidelines will result in disciplinary sanctions as expressed in Section 12.1. 
<BR>Advertisements must be placed in the proper sections of classified publications. They may not be placed under any heading that indicates they are employment ads. In addition to not using income claims, advertisements should be clear that commissions are paid on purchases, not enrollments, and ads should never indicate that large earnings are easy ... income is proportionate to effort. 
<P><B>4.2.5 - Advertising Guidelines </B>
<BR>The following guidelines are based on Pinnacle’s Policies and Procedures and, although representative of only a fraction of the most common questions submitted to Marketing Support, must be followed by Affiliates in order to protect the Pinnacle opportunity. These guidelines are for assistance in preparing material and are in addition to guidelines expressed elsewhere in these Policies and Procedures. These guidelines pertain to all advertising, including ”blind ads” (ads that do not specifically mention Pinnacle). 
<P>a). Advertising may not include income claims (see Section 4.4.2). 
<P>b). The names of any of Pinnacle’s customers may not be used specifically in any ad. 
<P>c). Affiliates may not use phrases that imply Pinnacle has merged or become partners with any other companies. 
<P>d). Copying of any company-produced materials (brochures, tapes, catalogs…etc) without prior written approval from Pinnacle is prohibited. This is a violation of trademark and copyright laws (see Section 4.2.2). 
<P>e). Reproduction of previously published articles or books also is in violation of trademark and copyright laws. 
<P>f). Statements that Affiliates are financial partners or equity partners with Pinnacle or any of Pinnacle’s marketing alliances are strictly prohibited. 
<P>g). The following phrases should not be used when describing the Pinnacle opportunity in ads or elsewhere: 
<BR>
<BR>· ”Investment” · ”Profit-Sharing” 
<BR>· ”Referral Fees” · ”Retirement Plan” 
<BR>· ”No Sales Required” · ”Residual or Passive Income” 
<BR>
<P>h). Services not currently offered by Pinnacle may not be promoted. 
<P>i). Affiliates may not use the name ”Pinnacle ” in their Internet or e-mail address except when email address is issued by Pinnacle. 
<BR>
<BR>Note: Many States have ”Business Opportunity” laws that are unrelated to what our Affiliates mean when referring to Pinnacle as a business opportunity. Therefore, to avoid confusion, Pinnacle asks its Affiliates not to refer to Pinnacle as a ”business opportunity.” You may say it is a home-based business or a great opportunity. 
<P><B>4.2.6 - Sample Ads and Phrases </B>
<BR>The guidelines expressed in Section 4.2.5 were established to protect the opportunity for all Affiliates. They were in no way meant to restrain the Affiliate from conducting his or her business in a fair, truthful and profitable manner. And since the majority of the above guidelines represent policies and procedures that prohibits certain actions, Pinnacle has developed some examples of phrases and advertisements that may be used by Affiliates if they so desire. These suggestions will be available on Pinnacle’s web page and are constantly updated to ensure Affiliates that they are in compliance with federal and state regulations. 
<BR>The sample list will include complete classified ads that can be used in their entirety. The list also will include phrases that will have specified, limited use and in no way should be used in conjunction with material that will violate the guidelines shown in Section 4.2.5. Any violation of the approved use for these sample ads or phrases could result in disciplinary sanctions as described in Section 12.1.&nbsp; 
<P><B>4.2.7 - Email Marketing 
<BR></B><B>Pinnacle prohibits the use of email in any manner associated with the transmission, distribution or delivery of any unsolicited bulk or unsolicited commercial e-mail ("Spam").</B> You also may not deliver Spam or cause Spam to be delivered to any of Pinnacle’s members, sales affiliates, trainers, vendors, employees or any other associates. 
<P>In addition, e-mail sent, or caused to be sent, to or through email may not:

<P>The use of email to transmit, distribute or deliver any solicited bulk or solicited commercial e-mail must include a clear &nbsp;explanation of why they are receiving the email and must include the easy ability to opt out of future emails. 
<P><B>4.3 - Changes to the Pinnacle Business</B> 
<P><B>4.3.1 - In General </B>
<BR>Each Affiliate must immediately notify Pinnacle of all changes to the information contained on the Affiliate’s Application and Agreement. Affiliates may modify their existing Affiliate Application (i.e., change Social Security Number to Federal ID Number, or change the form of ownership from an individual proprietorship to a business entity owned by the Affiliate) by submitting a written request, a properly executed Affiliate Application and Agreement, and appropriate supporting documentation. If the form of the business is being changed from a sole proprietorship to a corporation, partnership or trust, the original Affiliate must submit a Corporation, Partnership, Trust or DBA Form with the notification advising the company of the change. When adding a co-applicant (either an individual or a business entity) to an existing Pinnacle business, the Company requires both a written request, as well as a properly completed Affiliate Application and Agreement containing the applicant and co-applicant’s Social Security Number or Federal ID Number (if applicable) and signatures. To prevent the circumvention of Section 4.21 (regarding transfers and assignments of Pinnacle business), the original applicant must remain as a party to the original Affiliate Application and Agreement. The original Affiliate may not terminate his or her relationship with the Company unless the Affiliate Agreement (and the Pinnacle business) is terminated in its entirety. If the original Affiliate wants to terminate his or her relationship with the Company, he or she must transfer or assign his or her business in accordance with Section 4.21. All bonus and commission checks will be sent to the address of record of the original Affiliate. There is a non-refundable $25.00 fee for each applicant change requested, which must be included with the written request and the completed Affiliate Application and Agreement. Pinnacle may, at its discretion, require notarized documents before implementing any changes to a Pinnacle business. Please allow thirty (30) days after the receipt of the request by Pinnacle for processing. Please note that the modifications permitted within the scope of this paragraph do not include a change of sponsorship. Changes of management are addressed in Section 4.3.2 below. 
<P><B>4.3.2 - Change of Sponsor </B>
<BR>To protect the integrity of all sales teams and safeguard the hard work of all Affiliate’s, Pinnacle strongly discourages changes in sponsorship. Maintaining the integrity of sponsorship is critical for the success of every Affiliate and sales team. Accordingly, the transfer of a Pinnacle business from one Sponsor to another is rarely permitted. Requests for change of sponsorship must be submitted in writing to the Ethics and Compliance Department, and must include the reason for the transfer. Transfers will be considered only in the following two (2) circumstances: 
<P>a). In cases involving fraudulent inducement or unethical recruiting, an Affiliate may request that he or she be transferred to another sales team with his or her entire sales team intact. All requests for transfer alleging fraudulent enrollment practices shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with Pinnacle having the final decision whether such infraction occurred or 
<P>b). The Affiliate seeking to transfer submits a properly completed and fully executed Sponsor Transfer Form (available by faxed request to Ethics and Compliance), which includes the written approval of all parties whose income will be affected by the transfer. Photocopied or facsimile signatures are not acceptable. All Affiliate signatures must be notarized. The Affiliate who requests the transfer must submit non-refundable fee of $50 for administrative charges and data processing. If the transferring Affiliate also wants to move any of the Affiliates in his or her sales team, each Affiliate also must obtain a properly completed Management Transfer Form and return it to Pinnacle with the $50 non-refundable change fee (i.e., the transferring Affiliate and each Affiliate in his or her sales team multiplied by $50 is the cost to move a Pinnacle Business). Affiliates will not be moved with the transferring Affiliate unless all of the requirements of this paragraph are met. Transferring Affiliate’s must allow thirty (30) days after the receipt of the Sponsor Transfer Forms by Pinnacle for processing and verifying change requests. Final approval rests with Pinnacle. 
<P><B>4.3.3 - Cancellation, Termination and Re-application </B>
<BR>An Affiliate may legitimately change sales teams by voluntarily canceling or terminating his or her Pinnacle business (see Section 11.4) and remaining inactive for six (6) full calendar months (i.e.no sales of Pinnacle’s services, no recruiting, no attendance at any Pinnacle functions, no participation in any other form of Affiliate activity, or no operation of any other Pinnacle Affiliate’s business). Following the six-month period after cancellation or termination, the former Affiliate may re-apply under a new Sponsor. 
<P><B>4.4 - Claims that are Unauthorized</B> 
<P><B>4.4.1 - Indemnification </B>
<BR>An Affiliate is fully responsible for all of his or her verbal and written statements made regarding Pinnacle Faculty, Pinnacle Products and services, and the Marketing and Compensation Plan which are not expressly contained in current, official Pinnacle materials. Affiliates agree to indemnify Pinnacle and hold it harmless from any and all liability including judgments, civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs or lost business incurred by Pinnacle as a result of the Affiliate’s unauthorized representations. 
<P><B>4.4.2 – Income Claims </B>
<BR>In their enthusiasm to enroll prospective Affiliates, some Affiliates occasionally are tempted to make income claims or earnings representations to demonstrate the inherent power of direct marketing. This is counterproductive, because new Affiliates may become disappointed very quickly if their results are not as extensive or as rapid as the results others have achieved. At Pinnacle, we firmly believe that the Pinnacle income potential is great enough to be highly attractive, without reporting the earnings of others. 
<BR>Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission and several states have laws or regulations that govern or even prohibit certain types of income claims and testimonials made by persons engaged in direct marketing. While Affiliates may believe it is beneficial to provide copies of checks, or to disclose the earnings of themselves or others, such approaches have legal consequences that can negatively impact Pinnacle, as well as the Affiliate making the claim unless appropriate disclosures required by law also are made contemporaneously with the income claim or earnings representation. Because Pinnacle Affiliates do not have the data necessary to comply with the legal requirements for making income claims, an Affiliate, when presenting or discussing the Pinnacle opportunity or Marketing and Compensation Plan to a prospective Affiliate or customer, may not make income projections, income claims, or disclose his or her Pinnacle income (including the showing of checks, copies of checks or bank statements). Hypothetical income examples that are used to explain the operation of the Marketing and Compensation Plan, and which are solely based on mathematical projections, may be made to prospective Affiliates, so long as the Affiliate who uses such hypothetical examples makes clear to the prospective Affiliate(s) that such earnings are hypothetical. Hypothetical income examples should include disclaimers such as the following: ”Any earnings or success you achieve will vary according to the geographical location, time and effort put into your particular business and are not guaranteed by Pinnacle, its management, staff or Affiliates.” 
<P><B>4.5 - Commercial Outlets, Trade Shows and Expositions</B>

Affiliates are prohibited from unauthorized recruiting, which includes the following: 
<P>a). Actual or attempted recruitment or enrollment of Pinnacle Customers or Affiliates for other marketing business ventures, either directly or through a third party. This includes, but is not limited to, presenting or assisting in the presentation of other marketing business ventures. 
<P>b). Producing any literature, tapes or promotional material of any nature for another marketing business which is used by the Affiliate or any third person to recruit Pinnacle Customers or Affiliates for that business venture.

<P>d). Offering any non-Pinnacle products, services or business plan (by themselves or in conjunction with any Pinnacle Products or services) at any Pinnacle meeting, seminar, launch, convention or other Pinnacle function. 
<P><B>4.6.2 - Non-solicitation of Pinnacle Affiliates and Customers </B>
<BR>For a period of nine months after the cancellation (cancellation may be either voluntary, involuntary, through non- renewal or inactivity) of an individual or entity’s Affiliate Agreement, the ex-Affiliate shall not directly or through a third party solicit any Pinnacle Affiliate or Customer for any direct sales program or opportunity. This provision shall survive the termination or cancellation of the Affiliate’s Agreement. If the solicitation of the Affiliate or Customer is performed by a third party outside the Affiliate Agreement, Pinnacle will under-take any and all legal actions necessary to be compensated for the irreparable harm caused by the unauthorized solicitation. 
<P><B>4.6.3 – Sales Team Activity Reports </B>
<BR>All Sales Team Activity Reports are confidential and constitute proprietary business trade secrets belonging to Pinnacle.

<P>b). Use the information to compare with Pinnacle, or for any purpose other than promoting his or her Pinnacle business. 
<P>c). Recruit or solicit any independent Affiliate or Customer of Pinnacle listed on any report, or in any manner attempt to influence or induce any Affiliate or Customer of Pinnacle, to alter their business relationship with Pinnacle. 
<P>d). Use or disclose to any person, partnership, association, corporation or other entity any information contained in any Sales Team Activity Report.

A Pinnacle Affiliate’s business may change its status under the same Sponsor from an individual to a partnership, corporation or trust, or from one type of Entity to another. To do so, the Affiliate(s) must provide the Entity Documents and submit a properly completed Corporation, Partnership, Trust or DBA Form to Pinnacle. The Corporation, Partnership, Trust or DBA form must be signed by all of the shareholders, partners or trustees.

<BR>”Cross-team recruiting” is defined as the enrollment of an individual or Entity that already has a current Affiliate Agreement on file with Pinnacle, or who has had such an agreement within the preceding six calendar months, within a different line of management. Actual or attempted cross-team recruiting is strictly prohibited. The use of a spouse or relative’s name, trade names, DBAs, assumed names, corporations, partnerships, trusts, Federal ID Numbers, or fictitious ID numbers to circumvent this policy is prohibited. Affiliates may not demean, discredit or invalidate other Pinnacle Affiliates in an attempt to entice another Affiliate to become part of the first Affiliate’s sales team. This policy shall not prohibit the transfer of a Pinnacle business in accordance with Section 4.21. 
<P><B>4.9 - Errors or Questions </B>
<BR>In the event an Affiliate has questions about, or believes any errors have been made, regarding commissions, bonuses, sales team activity reports, auto-drafts or charges, the Affiliate must notify Pinnacle within 60 days of the date of the purported error or incident in question. Pinnacle will not be responsible for any errors, omissions or problems not reported within 60 days. 
<P><B>4.10 - Governmental Approval or Endorsement </B>
<BR>Neither federal or state regulatory agencies or officials approve or endorse any direct selling companies or programs.

<BR>Pinnacle Affiliate’s must not manipulate enrollments of new applicants and purchases of Pinnacle products or services. All Affiliate Applications and Agreements, and product orders must be submitted to Pinnacle within 24 hours from the time they are executed. 
<P><B>4.12 - Identification </B>
<BR>All Affiliates are required to provide their Social Security Number or a Federal Taxpayer Identification Number to Pinnacle on the Affiliate Application. Upon enrollment, the Company will provide a unique Identification Number to the Affiliate by which he or she will be identified. This number will be used to track commissions and bonuses. 
<P><B>4.13 - Income Taxes </B>
<BR>Every year, Pinnacle will provide an IRS Form 1099 MISC. (Non-employee Compensation) earnings statement to each U.S. resident who falls into one of the following categories;

<P>b). Made purchases during the previous calendar year in excess of $5,000. 
<BR>
<BR>Each Affiliate is responsible for paying local, state and federal taxes on any income generated as an Affiliate. If a business is tax exempt, the Federal Tax Identification Number must be provided to Pinnacle. 
<P><B>4.14 - Independent Contractor Status </B>
<BR>Affiliates are independent contractors and are not purchasers of a franchise or a business opportunity. The agreement between Pinnacle and its Affiliates does not create an employer-employee relationship, agency, partnership or joint venture between the Company and the Affiliate. Affiliates shall not be treated as an employee for his or her services or for federal or state tax purposes. All Affiliates are responsible for paying local, state and federal taxes due from all compensation earned as an Affiliate of the Company. The Affiliate has no authority (expressed or implied) to bind the company to any obligation. Each Affiliate is encouraged to establish his or her own goals, hours and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the Agreement, these Policies and Procedures and applicable laws.

This can often be accomplished with a simple ”Business Pursuit” endorsement. attached to your present homeowner’s policy. 
<P><B>4.16 - International Marketing </B>
<BR>Because of critical legal and tax considerations, including: compliance with foreign laws regarding product approval or registration; cautionary statements; protection of intellectual property; compliance with customs, tax and immigration laws; compliance with direct selling laws; product and income representations; and literature content and language requirements, Pinnacle must limit the sale of Pinnacle products and services, and the presentation of the Pinnacle business to prospective Customers and Affiliates located within the United States and U.S. Territories. Moreover, allowing a few Affiliates to conduct business in markets not yet opened by Pinnacle would violate the concept of affording every Affiliate the equal opportunity to expand internationally. 
<BR>Accordingly, Affiliates are authorized to sell Pinnacle training services, and enroll Customers or Affiliates only in the countries in which Pinnacle is authorized to conduct business, as announced from time to time in official company literature. No Affiliate may, in any unauthorized country: (a) conduct sales, enrollment or training meetings; (b) enroll or attempt to enroll potential Customers of Affiliates; or (c) conduct any other activity for the purpose of selling Pinnacle products and services, establishing a sales team, or promoting the Pinnacle opportunity. 
<P><B>4.17 - Laws and Ordinances</B> 
<P><B>4.17.1 - Local Ordinances </B>
<BR>Many cities and counties have laws regulating certain home-based businesses. In most cases these ordinances are not applicable to Affiliates because of the nature of’ their business. However, Affiliates must obey those laws that do apply to them. If a city or county official tells an Affiliate that an ordinance applies to him or her, the Affiliate shall be cooperative and immediately send a copy of the ordinance to the Compliance Department of Pinnacle. In most cases, there are exceptions to the ordinance that apply to Pinnacle Affiliates. 
<P><B>4.17.2 - Compliance With Federal, State and Local Laws </B>
<BR>Affiliates shall comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations in the conduct of their businesses. The violation or attempted violation of’ any such law or regulation, or fraudulent or deceptive conduct, shall be grounds for disciplinary action by Pinnacle.

<P><B>4.19 - One Pinnacle Business </B>
<BR>An Affiliate may operate or have an ownership interest, legal or equitable, in only one Pinnacle business. No individual may have, operate or receive compensation from more than one Pinnacle business. Individuals of the same family unit may not enter into or have an interest in more than one Affiliate agreement. A “family unit” is defined as spouses and dependant children living at, or doing business at, the same address. The Affiliate’s Agreement is voidable by Pinnacle if the Affiliate or the family unit to which the Affiliate belongs has previously signed an Affiliate Agreement, unless the prior agreement expired or was terminated at least six calendar months prior thereto, or the Agreement represents the exception in 4.19.1. 
<P><B>4.19.1 - Married Couple Exception </B>
<BR>An exception to the one business per Affiliate rule pertains to married couples, who may maintain separate Affiliate status.

<P>b). One spouse may terminate or sell his or her Pinnacle business and become a co-applicant with the other. See Section 4.21 regarding the sale of a Pinnacle business, Section 4.3.1 regarding the addition of a co-applicant and Section 4.3.2 regarding change of Sponsor. 
<P>c). One spouse can terminate or sell his or her Pinnacle business and can be sponsored by the other. 
<P><B>4.19.3 - Actions of Household Members or Affiliated Individuals </B>

Similarly, if any individual associated in any way with a corporation, partnership, trust or other Entity (collectively “affiliated individual”) violates the Agreement, such action(s) will be deemed a violation by the Entity, and Pinnacle may take disciplinary action against the Entity. 
<P><B>4.20 - Requests for Records </B>
<BR>Any request from an Affiliate for copies of invoices or other records will require a fee of $10. Requests for sales team reports will require a fee of $0.02 cents per line with a minimum cost of $10. These fees cover the expense of mailing and time required to research files and make copies of the records. Distribution by any service other than regular first-class mail will be at an additional charge. All fees must be paid by credit card. 
<P><B>4.21 - Sale, Transfer or Assignment of Pinnacle Business </B>
<BR>Although an Affiliates business is a privately owned, independently operated business, the sale, transfer or assignment of an Affiliates business, is subject to certain limitations on the transfer of the business. If an Affiliate wishes to sell his or her Pinnacle business, the following criteria must be met: 
<P>a). Protection of the existing line of management must always be maintained so that the Pinnacle business continues to be operated in that line of management. 
<P>b). The buyer or transferee must not be a current Affiliate of Pinnacle. If the buyer is an active Pinnacle Affiliate, he or she must first terminate his or her Pinnacle business and remain inactive for six (6) full calendar months before becoming eligible for a purchase, transfer, assignment or acquisition of any interest in the Pinnacle business. 
<P>c). Before the sale, transfer or assignment can be finalized and approved by Pinnacle, any debt obligations the selling Affiliate has with Pinnacle must be satisfied. Pinnacle reserves the right to have the purchase funds placed in a Pinnacle escrow account for 90 days before the funds can be released to the seller. 
<P>d). The selling Affiliate must be in good standing and not in violation of any of the terms of the Affiliate Agreement or these Policies and Procedures, in order to be eligible to sell, transfer or assign a Pinnacle business. 
<P>e). No sale, assignment or transfer of any Affiliate Entity (or Affiliate rights) shall be effective without the prior written approval of Pinnacle. All sales, transfers or assignments are at the sole discretion of Pinnacle. 
<P>f). Prior to approval, Pinnacle requires that all documents of sale or transfer first be signed and notarized by all interested parties of the sale, transfer or assignment, and then submitted to Pinnacle for review and approval. 
<P>g). Pinnacle maintains the Right of First Refusal to purchase the said Affiliate business. In the event Pinnacle does purchase the Affiliate business, any and all revenue earned by the Affiliate business will go to the company. 
<P>h). If it is determined in the Company’s sole discretion that the Affiliate Entity was transferred in an effort to circumvent compliance with the Agreement, the Policies and Procedures or the Compensation Plan, the transfer shall be declared null and void, and the Affiliate Entity shall revert to the transferring Affiliate, who shall be treated as if the transfer had never occurred from the reversion day forward. If necessary, and in the Company’s sole discretion, appropriate action, including termination, may be taken against the transferring Affiliate to ensure compliance with the Affiliate Agreement and the Policies and Procedures. 
<P>i). Pinnacle will charge the selling Affiliate a fee of $100 or 3 percent of the Affiliate business sales price, whichever is higher. 
<BR>
<P><B>4.22 - Separation or Termination of a Pinnacle Business </B>
<BR>Pinnacle Affiliates sometimes operate their Pinnacle businesses as husband-wife partnerships, regular partnerships, corporations or trusts. At such time as a marriage may end in divorce or a corporation, partnership or trust (the latter three are collectively referred to herein as ”Entities”) may dissolve, arrangements must be made to assure that any separation or division of the business is accomplished so as not to adversely affect the interests and income of other Affiliates in the sales management or the sales team. If the separating parties fail to provide for the best interests of other Affiliates and the Company, Pinnacle will involuntarily terminate the Affiliate Agreement. 
<BR>During the pendency of a divorce or Entity dissolution, the parties must adopt one of the following methods of operation: 
<P>a). One of the parties may, with consent of the other(s), operate the Pinnacle business pursuant to an assignment in writing where by the relinquishing spouse, shareholders, partners or trustees authorize Pinnacle to deal directly and solely with the other spouse or non-relinquishing shareholder, partner or trustee. 
<P>b). The parties may continue to operate the Pinnacle business jointly on a ”business-as-usual” basis, whereupon all compensation paid by Pinnacle will be paid in the joint names of the Affiliates or in the name of the entity to be divided as the parties may independently agree between themselves. 
<BR>
<BR>Under no circumstances will the sales team of divorcing spouses, or that of a Pinnacle business formerly operated by two or more individuals as any form of Entity, be divided. Similarly, under no circumstances will Pinnacle split commission and bonus checks between divorcing spouses or members of dissolving Entities. Pinnacle will recognize only one sales team and will issue only one commission check per Pinnacle business, per commission cycle. Commissions always shall be issued to the same individual or Entity. In the event that parties to a divorce or dissolution proceeding are unable to resolve a dispute over the disposition of commissions and ownership of the business, the Affiliate Agreement shall be involuntarily canceled. 
<BR>If a former spouse or a former Entity owner has completely relinquished all rights in his or her original Pinnacle business, they are thereafter free to enroll under any Sponsor of their choosing, so long as they meet the waiting period requirements set forth in Section 4.3.3. In such case, however, such former spouse or partner shall have no rights to any Affiliates in his or her former sales team or to any former Customer. They must develop the new business in the same manner, as would any other new Independent business. 
<P><B>4.23 - Recruiting </B>
<BR>All active Affiliates of Pinnacle in good standing have the right to recruit and enroll others in Pinnacle. Each prospective Customer or Affiliate has the ultimate right to choose his or her own Sponsor. If two Affiliates claim to be the Sponsor of the same new Affiliate or Customer, the Company shall regard the first application received by the Company as controlling. 
<BR>As a general rule, industry practice regards the first Affiliate who meaningfully works with a prospective Customer or Affiliate as having first claim to management. Basic tenets of common sense and consideration should govern. 
<P><B>4.24 - Succession </B>
<BR>Upon the death or incapacitation of an Affiliate, his or her business may be passed to his or her heirs. Appropriate legal documentation must be submitted to the Company to ensure the transfer meets its requirements. Accordingly, an Affiliate should consult an attorney to assist him or her in the preparation of a will or other testamentary instrument. Whenever a Pinnacle business is transferred by a will or other testamentary process, the beneficiary acquires both existing liability and the right to collect all bonuses and commissions of the deceased Affiliate’s sales team provided the following qualifications are met. If the heir so chooses, he or she may sell, transfer or assign the Affiliate business according to the policies expressed in Section 4.21. If the heir(s) choose to conduct the Pinnacle business, they must: 
<P>a). Execute an Affiliate Agreement. 
<P>b). Comply with terms and provisions of the Agreement. 
<P>c). Meet all of the qualifications for the deceased Affiliate’s status. 
<BR>
<BR>Bonus and commission checks of a Pinnacle business transferred pursuant to this section will be paid in a single check jointly to the devisees. The devisees must provide Pinnacle with appropriate banking information to which all bonuses and commissions will be sent. 
<P><B>4.24.1 - Transfer Upon Death of an Affiliate </B>
<BR>To effect a testamentary transfer of a Pinnacle business, the successor must provide the following to Pinnacle : (1) an original death certificate; (2) a notarized copy of the will or other instrument establishing the successor’s right to the Pinnacle business: and (3) a completed and executed Affiliate Agreement.

<P><B>4.25 - Vacancy Due to Cancellation or Termination </B>
<BR>In order to protect the integrity of the Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan and the commission structure for individual Affiliates, Pinnacle will move all the vacating Affiliate’s customers and recruited Affiliates to his Sponsor. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>SECTION 5 - Responsibilities OF Affiliates</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>5.1 - Change of Address or Telephone</B> 
<BR>To ensure timely delivery of support materials and other communications, it is critically important that Pinnacle’s files are current. Street addresses are required for shipping since UPS cannot deliver to a post office box. Affiliates planning to move should send their new address and telephone to Pinnacle’s Corporate Offices to the attention of the Affiliate Support Department. In order to guarantee proper delivery, two weeks advance notice must be provided to Pinnacle on all changes. 
<P><B>5.2 - Continuing Development Obligations</B> 
<P><B>5.2.1 - Ongoing Sales Responsibilities </B>
<BR>Regardless of their level of achievement, Affiliates have an ongoing obligation to personally promote sales through the continual and regular servicing of their existing Customers and through the generation of new Customers. Upon request, every Affiliate should be able to provide documented evidence to Pinnacle of his or her ongoing fulfillment of their Affiliate sales responsibilities. 
<P><B>5.2.2 - Ongoing Training </B>
<BR>Any Affiliate who recruits another Affiliate into Pinnacle must perform a bona fide supervisory function to ensure that his or her sales team is properly operating his or her Pinnacle business. Affiliates must have ongoing contact, communication and management supervision with the Affiliates in their sales teams. Examples of such contact and supervision may include, but are not limited to: newsletters, written correspondence, personal meetings, telephone contact, voice mail, electronic mail, and the accompaniment of Affiliates to Pinnacle meetings, training sessions and other functions. Sponsor Affiliates also are responsible to motivate and train new Affiliates in Pinnacle Product knowledge, effective sales techniques, the Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan, and these Policies and Procedures. Affiliates must monitor the Affiliates in their sales teams to ensure that their Independent Affiliate’s do not make improper product or business claims, or engage in any illegal or inappropriate conduct. Upon request, every Affiliate should be able to provide documented evidence to Pinnacle of his or her ongoing fulfillment of the responsibilities of a Sponsor. 
<P><B>5.3 - Non-disparagement </B>
<BR>In setting the proper example for their sales team, Affiliates must not disparage other Pinnacle Affiliates, Pinnacle’s products and services, it’s Faculty, the Marketing and Compensation Plan or the company’s employees. 
<P><B>5.4 - Reporting Policy Violations </B>
<BR>Affiliates observing a Policy violation by another Affiliate should bring the violation directly to the attention of the Pinnacle Ethics and Compliance Department. Details of the incidents such as dates, number of occurrences, persons involved, and any supporting documentation should be included in the report, which needs to be in writing. 
<P><B>5.5 - Reviewing Policies and Procedures with Applicants </B>
<BR>Affiliates must review the most current version of the Policies and Procedures with individuals whom they are enrolling or recruiting to become Affiliates before the applicant signs an Affiliate Agreement. 
<P><B>5.6 - Unauthorized Communications </B>
<BR>In the excitement and enthusiasm of working their Pinnacle business, Affiliates occasionally try to contact Pinnacle’s vendors, suppliers and faculty with questions or ideas. Because of their inability to handle the number of potential contacts, and in respect of rights to privacy, any such communication without Pinnacle’s prior written consent is strictly prohibited. This would include, but not limited to, phone, fax or personal contacts to: 
<BR>· Pinnacle’s Vendors or Suppliers 
<BR>· Pinnacle’s Faculty &amp; Financial Partners 
<BR>· Pinnacle’s Marketing Alliances 
<BR>· Company employees outside corporate workplace.

<P><B>SECTION 6 - SALES REQUIREMENTS</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>6.1 – Product (Service) Sales</B> 
<BR>The Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan is based upon the sale of Pinnacle products and services to customers.

<BR>
<BR>Affiliates must satisfy their monthly Personal Sales Volume requirements as stated in the Pinnacle Marketing and Compensation Plan.

<P><B>6.2 - No Price or Territory Restrictions </B>
<BR>Affiliates are required to sell Pinnacle products and services at the suggested prices set by Pinnacle on the Pinnacle price list. There are no exclusive territories granted to anyone. No franchise fees are required. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>SECTlON 7 - BONUSES AND COMMISSIONS</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>7.1 - Commission and Bonus Qualifications </B>
<BR>An Affiliate must be active and in compliance with the Agreement to qualify for commissions and bonuses. So long as an Affiliate complies with the terms of the Agreement, Pinnacle shall pay commissions and bonuses to such Affiliate in accordance with the Marketing and Compensation Plan. Unless specified differently, commissions and bonuses are paid on or before the tenth of each month. Allow 2 – 3 days for the ACH payment to be deposited into the Affiliate bank account. 
<P><B>7.2 - Adjustment to Commissions and Bonuses </B>
<BR>Affiliates receive commissions and bonuses based on the actual sales of Pinnacle products and services to customers. When a service is cancelled and refunded by the Company, the commissions and bonuses attributable to the refunded service will be deducted in the month in which the refund is given, and will continue every pay period thereafter until the commission is recovered, from the Affiliates who received commissions and bonuses on the sales of the refunded service. If necessary, the Affiliate will be charged the amount of the adjustment until the account is cleared. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>SECTION 8 - ORDERING</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>8.1 - Sales Goals</B> 
<BR>The Pinnacle opportunity for the Affiliate is based upon the sale of Pinnacle products and services to customers. To achieve this goal, Pinnacle has developed an online company store for Affiliates to order sales aids, sales literature, and promotional supplies. 
<P><B>8.2 - Shipping and Back-Order Policy </B>
<BR>Pinnacle normally will ship Affiliate products within 2 business days from the date on which it processes an order. Pinnacle will expeditiously ship any part of an order currently in stock. If, however, an ordered item is out of stock, it will be placed on back-order and sent when Pinnacle receives additional inventory. Pinnacle will notify Affiliates if items are back-ordered and are not expected to ship within 30 days from the date of the order. An estimated shipping date also will be provided. Back-ordered items may be canceled upon an Affiliate’s request. Affiliates may request a refund or credit on an account for canceled back-orders. 
<P><B>8.3 - Confirmation of Order </B>
<BR>An Affiliate must confirm that the product received matches the product listed on the shipping invoice and is free of damage. Failure to notify Pinnacle of any shipping discrepancy or damage within thirty days of shipment will cancel an Affiliate’s right to request a correction. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>SECTION 9 – PAYMENT AND SHIPPING</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>9.1 - Insufficient Funds</B> 
<BR>It is the responsibility of each Affiliate to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit available in his or her account to cover the order. Pinnacle will not contact Affiliates regarding orders canceled due to insufficient funds or credit. Pinnacle will not be responsible for any insufficient charges incurred by the Affiliate’s financial institution as a result of their insufficient funds 
<P><B>9.2 - Returned Checks </B>
<BR>All checks returned by an Affiliate’s bank for insufficient funds will not be re-submitted for payment. A $25.00 returned check fee will be charged to the account of the Affiliate. After receiving a returned check from a Customer or an Affiliate, all future orders must be paid by credit card, money order or cashier’s check. Any outstanding balance owed to Pinnacle by an Affiliate for NSF checks and returned check fees will be withheld from subsequent commission and bonus payments. 
<P><B>9.3 - Sales Taxes </B>
<BR>In designing the Pinnacle opportunity, one of our guiding philosophies has been to free Affiliates from as many administrative, operational and logistical tasks as possible. In doing so, Affiliates are free to concentrate on those activities that directly affect their incomes, namely product sales and enrollment activities. To these ends, Pinnacle relieves Affiliates of the tremendous burdens of collecting and remitting sales taxes, filing tax reports, and keeping records relative to sales taxes. 
<P>By virtue of its business operations, Pinnacle is required to charge sales taxes on all purchases made by Affiliates and Customers, and remit the taxes charged to the respective states. Accordingly, Pinnacle will collect and remit sales taxes on behalf of Affiliates, based on the suggested retail price of the products, according to applicable tax rates in the state which the shipment is destined. If an Affiliate has submitted, and Pinnacle has accepted, a current Sales Tax Exemption Certificate and Sales Tax Registration License, sales taxes will not be added to the invoice and the responsibility of collecting and remitting sales taxes to the appropriate authorities shall be upon the Affiliate. Exemption from the payment of sales tax is applicable only to orders that have shipped to a state for which the proper tax exemption papers have been filed and accepted. Applicable sales taxes will be charged on orders that are drop-shipped to another state. Any sales tax exemption accepted by Pinnacle is not retroactive. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>SECTION 10 – PRODUCT RETURNS</B> <FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><B>10.1 - Return of Inventory and Sales Aids by Affiliates Upon Termination</B>
