<P align=center><FONT size=3>“The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth” </FONT>
<P align=center><FONT size=3>“Pure knowledge … shall greatly enlarge the soul.”</FONT> 
<P align=left>
<BR><FONT size=3>What is this knowledge, intelligence, and light and truth that our Heavenly Father would have us receive? Does it consist solely of the truths God has revealed through his prophets? What place does knowledge gleaned from secular sources and with secular means have in the scheme of eternal progression?</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>In considering these questions, we must recognize that secular knowledge alone can never save a soul nor open the celestial kingdom to anyone.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Secular knowledge can be most helpful to the children of our Father in Heaven who, having placed first things first, have found and are living those truths which lead one to eternal life. These are they who have the balance and perspective to seek all knowledge—revealed and secular—as a tool and servant for the blessing of themselves and others. They know that preeminent among all activities in this life is preparing themselves for eternal life by subjugating the flesh, subjecting the body to the spirit, overcoming weaknesses, and so governing themselves that they may give leadership to others. Important, but of second priority, comes the knowledge associated with life in mortality.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Thus, our real business on earth is to master self. And as we master ourselves, we will learn to master the earth and its elements. Most important, we will learn how to help others overcome and perfect themselves in all ways of living.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>It is clear that the Lord expects his people to have a wide variety of information so that we might have breadth and depth in our lives.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>“Things … in heaven” might be the study of astronomy and related subjects. To know and appreciate the wonders of the heavens cannot but increase our appreciation of God and his great wisdom and power. Parents may wish to learn about these wonders and teach their children by putting into their hands materials suited to their age and development.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The counsel to learn of things “in the earth” echoes the commandment given to Adam and Eve to replenish the earth and subdue it. The Lord has also said in these last days, “The fullness of the earth is yours, … yea, all things which come of the earth … are made for the benefit and the use of man. … And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man.”&nbsp;To understand the soil and the seasons is a fascinating study for all families as well as for scientists. A garden for every home, even if only a window box, can furnish beginning knowledge for all ages.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Subduing the earth also involves the engineering sciences as well as biology, geology, and other sciences that study the earth’s land, air, and water. The study of land and water must also consider that which is “under the earth” and all the potentials of nature and its elements.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>To study “things which have been” is to delve into history, a lifetime challenge. In addition, current events, or history in the making, should give us concern for careful study.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>To learn of “things which are at home” could mean a great invitation to all&nbsp;to become masters in the science and art of home building and homemaking; husband and wife relationships; parent and child relationships, training, leadership, teaching, and felicity; and all that is associated with family life, in order that we might become masters in loving and teaching others throughout eternity.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The “wars and perplexities of the nations” is a great concern to us now that the world is a large community. Perplexities afflicting one people affect the lives of others distantly removed.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Gaining “a knowledge of countries … and kingdoms” will be found in a study of political and physical geography, languages, and customs.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>But how will we obtain this knowledge? We expect all&nbsp;to gain such knowledge naturally, as a result of righteousness and by study and faith.&nbsp; We must do more than ask the Lord for learning. Perspiration must precede inspiration; there must be effort before there is the harvest. We must take thought, work, be patient, and acquire competence.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>As a people, we have been encouraged by the Lord to progress in the learning of God as well as in the sound learning of the earth. Too many of us spend far too much time watching the television or in habits and activities that do not enlarge ourselves or bless others. Would that we might lift ourselves to higher visions of what we could do with our lives! </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>And let us remember that it is not so much what we know that is important, as what we do and what we are. The Master’s plan is a program of doing, of living, not merely knowing. Knowledge itself is not the end. It is how we righteously live and apply that knowledge in our own lives and how we apply it to help others that describes our character.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>If we seek true happiness, we must expend our energies for purposes larger than our own self-interests. Let us ponder prayerfully how we may effectively and lovingly give service to our families, neighbors, and fellow citizens.&nbsp; And let us know that when we learn to do this we have learned one of the great truths of eternity.</FONT>
