<P align=center><FONT color=#993300 size=5>Ignorance Is Expensive</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Some years ago while I was serving in the navy and was away from home, a very prominent and well-to-do farmer died in my home neighborhood. Upon my return I was talking with my cousin about the estate of the deceased, and I asked the inevitable question, “How much did he leave?” My cousin said, “He left it all; he didn’t take any of it with him.”</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>That struck me as being a great truth that very, very few men seem ever to comprehend. Certainly many of us act as though we are going to take it all with us when we go; of course, we are not. In terms of material things, each of us leaves it all. In the words of Paul to Timothy, “For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.” (1 Tim. 6:7.)</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Well, isn’t there anything good we can take with us when we go, we may ask? A Prophet taught that the knowledge and intelligence gained here in this life would go with us when we leave.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>"And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come."</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Ignorance is expensive; in fact, it is the most expensive commodity we know anything about. Certainly we make many mistakes through ignorance. If it is a violation of a commandment of God which we have never received and thus do not know, then the Lord does not hold us guilty of the sin. “… to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.” (James 4:17.) And in Paul’s words, “… where no law is, there is no transgression.” (Rom. 4:15.) But even though we may not be guilty of the sin because of our ignorance, neither can we receive the blessing, which is predicated on obedience, without rendering obedience to that law. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Therefore, we are denied the blessing through our ignorance. If it is a traffic law we have violated through ignorance, the penalty assessed us is exactly the same as if we had known. Also, if we stick a finger in an electric light socket, we will receive the same shock, irrespective of our knowledge of electricity. </FONT>
<P align=center><FONT size=3>I repeat, ignorance is expensive. </FONT>
