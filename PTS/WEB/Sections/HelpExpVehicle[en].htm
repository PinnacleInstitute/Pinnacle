<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">First, the general rule: the IRS says your vehicle is deductible to the extent you use it for business.<br><br>So, if you drive your car 100% for business, all car-related expenses are deductible.<br><br>But
if you use it less than 100% for business, do not despair.
Less-than-100% use is very typical among small business owners and the
self-employed -- you'll still come out way ahead by keeping good
vehicle expense records.<br><br>For example, if you drive your car 75% for business, then you get to deduct 75% of your vehicle expenses.<br><br>Now to the fun part:<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reporting Auto Expenses</span><br>There are two small business tax tips for reporting your car expenses: <br></font></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><ol><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Actual Expense Method&nbsp;</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Mileage Method</font></li></ol></div><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">With the Actual Expense Method, you have to keep track of all your vehicle related expenses, such as:<br><br></font></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Verdana" size="3">gasoline </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">oil </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">maintenance &amp; repairs </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">insurance </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">license &amp; registration </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">wash &amp; wax </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">supplies &amp; equipment </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">depreciation expense (including Section 179 deduction) </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">lease payments </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">loan interest </font><br><font face="Verdana" size="3">state and local taxes</font></div><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">So
you add up all those deductions and multiply the total by your business
use percentage, which is determined by dividing business miles by total
miles driven.<br><br>The Mileage Method works like this: instead of
tracking all the actual expenses listed above, you only need the number
of business miles driven, which is multiplied by the standard mileage
rate published each year by the IRS.<br><br>For 2009, the business mileage rate is 55 cents per mile.<br>If you drove your car 10,000 miles in 2009, your deduction is $5,500 -- regardless of what your actual expenses might have been.<br><br>NOTE:&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="3">In addition to the mileage allowance, you 
				can also deduct parking (with limitations), interest, tolls, and property
          taxes on the vehicle (not sales tax).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><br>Now for the obvious question:<br><br>Which auto deduction method is better -- Actual or Mileage?<br>If
you want to get the highest deduction, you should "run the numbers"
under both methods and then use whichever method results in the higher
deduction.<br><br>You are allowed to pick whichever method you want.<br><br>But
once you pick a method, be careful to follow the rules on "switching"
from one method to the other: You can switch from the Mileage Method to
the Actual Method, but generally are not allowed to switch from the
Actual Method to the Mileage Method.<br><br>Having said that, let's be
practical. If you hate recordkeeping, use the Mileage Method. It's much
simpler and faster. You won't have to keep all those receipts.<br><br>Even
the Mileage Method requires some recordkeeping, however. You should
keep a log that documents the business use of the vehicle.&nbsp;<br><br>Regardless of which method you use, there's a goldmine of deductions sitting right there in the garage.<br></font></p><div align="left"><p><font face="Verdana" size="3">Commuting mile to and from
          the office are never deductible.&nbsp; If you have a Home Based
          Business,&nbsp;you don't have a commute (there's no such
          thing as commuting when you have a home office).&nbsp; Your office is
          at home, so anytime you leave your house could potentially be for
          business.&nbsp; As you go to the store, to a friend's house, anywhere,
          be sure to make it a business trip.&nbsp; Conduct some form of
          business.&nbsp; Handing out business cards, talking to people about
          your business, are all great ways to convert personal use miles into
          business use miles.&nbsp; </font></p></div>
