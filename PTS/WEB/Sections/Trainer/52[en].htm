<P><!- StartFragment - ><!- StartFragment - >&nbsp;<H2>What do you want?</H2>
<P><B> A professional coach has a life-altering ability to accelerate your own understanding of where you are and where you want to be, professionally and personally.</B>
<UL>
<LI><B> Accelerate your success</B>
<LI><B> Expand your possibilities</B>
<LI><B> Sustain your profitability</B>
<LI><B> Fulfill your destiny
<BR></B>
</UL>
<P><B> These are the requirements for healthy individuals and growing organizations. These compelling concerns demand time and attention, even with constant change, pressing priorities, overwhelming overload, and stifling stress. I can <U>accelerate</U> your productivity, profitability, and possibility. </B><H2>What can I deliver? </H2>
<P><B> I believe your experience of life can be one of thriving instead of striving. My clients have shown they can produce extraordinary outcomes by abandoning ordinary solutions. You can get more by being more, building on coursework, exceptional assessments and guidance to achieve real competitive advantages in the marketplace, and optimum performance in all areas of your life.</B>
<P><B> <IMG height=118 src="http://theacceleratorcoach.com/images/CODonnell.jpg" width=75 align=left></B> "I have had the great fortune to have David Flack as my coach for over a year now. As president and owner of my startup training companies, I find his requests have me overcoming daunting obstacles in this time of economic uncertainty. While it is the most challenging time in my life to date, David’s coaching and support keeps me on track by looking for opportunities and maintaining my enthusiasm with a realistic view of the challenges I face in my clients’ information technology, telecommunications, medicine, financial services, and transportation industries —even when my circumstances are extraordinarily difficult. Identifying my strengths and values, David’s combination of being tremendously resourceful, an incredibly good listener, and so very encouraging gives me a platform to achieve my dearest goals and contribute to my community"

<P>
<BR><B> As a professional ‘non-sports’ coach, I adhere to a form of coaching that honors you -the client -as the expert of your own experience. I believe you are already creative, resourceful and have what it takes to live a rewarding life. You are healthy, mindful, and purposeful. I'm here to assist you, not "fix" you.</B>
<P><B> With this context as the basis of our coaching/training relationship, my responsibility is four-fold:</B>
<OL>
<LI><B> To discover, clarify, and align with what you want to achieve</B>
<LI><B> To encourage your self-discovery</B>
<LI><B> To elicit and evoke your own generated solutions and strategies</B>
<LI><B> To hold you responsible and accountable for your stated commitments</B>
</OL>
<P><B> Therefore, my professional coaching and facilitation&nbsp;is an ongoing partnership that assists you in your own production of fulfilling results that you say you want. Through my&nbsp;process, you will deepen your learning of yourself and others, improve your performance in multiple areas of your life, and enhance the overall quality of your life.</B>
<P><!- StartFragment - >&nbsp;“David Flack, The Accelerator Coach, not only knows how to motivate people to give their best, he is both inspirational and instructional with his powerful programs. When you read his writing, you'll find yourself delving deep into your own character and discovering your own resources to help you succeed in all aspects of life and business. He is a coach, a philosopher, a teacher, and more importantly in my view, a mentor.” ~ Jory Sherman, Pulitzer Prize Nominated Author of over 300 books 
<P><B> In each call or class (I was formerly a&nbsp;T&amp;D Manager for 500 employees and created a virtual university over a seven year period)&nbsp;or meeting with me, you choose the focus of conversation, while I deeply listen and then contribute meaningful observations and further questions. This interaction of our coaching relationship creates clarity and moves you into action. My coaching <U>accelerates</U> your progress by providing you with greater focus and more awareness of choice in your life. It concentrates on where you are today – right now - and what you are willing to be&nbsp; - and then do -&nbsp;to have whatever you want for yourself in the near and distant future.</B>
