<P>For the past fifteen years, I have been an independent full time English tutor.&nbsp; My main areas of strength are in vocabulary development and in the analysis of systematic errors.&nbsp; A systematic error is a linguistic term used to denote areas that are sourced from deep structure in a language learner's first language.&nbsp; I have a thorough knowledge of deep structure errors&nbsp;sourced by&nbsp;Chinese L1 students, who are learning&nbsp;or upgrading their English skills.&nbsp; Systematic errors are primarily found in writing.&nbsp; &nbsp; 
<P><B>Publications</B> 
<P>I have published travel articles in eleven countries and have written countless children's stories, some of which are used by Australian teachers and some by Canadian teachers.&nbsp; I presently publish online at suite101.com.&nbsp; I have three topics on the go at Suite: Pacific Islands, Folklore and Larry Low's Creative Writing.&nbsp;
