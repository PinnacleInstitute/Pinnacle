<B> <FONT size=3>The Church</FONT></B>
<P>When Jesus Christ lived on the earth, He organized His Church so that all people could receive His gospel and return one day to live with God, our Heavenly Father. After Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, His Apostles continued to receive revelation from Him on how to direct the work of His Church. However, after they were killed, members changed the teachings of the Church that He had established. While many good people and some truth remained, this Apostasy, or general falling away from the truth, brought about the withdrawal of the Church from the earth. The Apostle Peter prophesied that Jesus would restore His Church before His Second Coming (Acts 3:19–21). 
<P>Jesus Christ began to restore His Church in its fulness to the earth through the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1820. It has grown to become a worldwide Church with over 11 million members. It has the same teachings and basic organization as the Church established by Jesus in New Testament times. 
<P><B> <FONT size=3>Families</FONT></B> 
<P>Families can be one of our greatest sources of happiness. No love is so deep, no joy is so full as that which can exist within the family circle. Families can help bring us the best that life has to offer. 
<P>Within the family we can also feel the deepest heartache. Families can falter and even fail. Yet happiness in a family is often possible even when heartaches come. 
<P>Like everything of value, family relationships take work, but they are worth the effort because families are meant to be together forever and are meant to bring us joy. 
<P><FONT size=3><B> Nature of God 
<BR></B></FONT>
<BR>Most people believe in a Supreme Being, even though they may call Him by different names. 
<P>We know that God, our Heavenly Father, lives. He knows you and each of us and loves us all as His children. 
<P>We are commanded to love God (Mathew 22:36-38).&nbsp; Jesus Christ taught that we must know the only true God to have eternal life (John 17:3). As His Children, we must know who He is and what He is like. 
<P>As you come to know and love God, you will find greater peace and joy, both in this life and in the life to come. 
<P><B> <FONT size=3>Purpose of life 
<BR></FONT></B> 
<BR>Have you ever asked yourself any of these questions: 
<UL>
<LI>What isthe purpose of life?
<LI>Where did I come from?
<LI>Why am I here?
<LI>Where am I going?
</UL>
<P>If so, you’re not alone. Most people have asked these questions. We want to understand the larger purpose and meaning of our lives. Without purpose, living day to day can become tedious and empty. 
<P>Fortunately, there are answers to these questions—answers that can give you a sense of purpose and help you find lasting happiness. Answers such as: 
<UL>
<LI>You are a child of God. 
<LI>Before you were born, you lived as a spirit with God, your Heavenly Father. 
<LI>You came to Earth to learn to be more like God. 
<LI>When your life on Earth is over, you can return to live with your Heavenly Father.
