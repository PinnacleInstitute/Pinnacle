<P><B>Turning Negatives Into Positives</B> 
<P align=justify>Jimmy learned some tough lessons early in his life. As a Hispanic he was reared in a predominately segregated community. Except for his parents, he always had the feeling that no one cared. The system certainly didn't challenge Jimmy to be expressive and think about setting goals. He experienced steady, bitter rejection and prejudice from a society that labeled him "different." Eventually he realized that although you cannot forget the past and the pain, you can forgive, learn from, stand firm, and move on. Dealing with and overcoming his damaged emotions, Jimmy learned how to turn the negatives he experienced into positive learning experiences. 
<P><B>There Is Life After High Schoo</B>l 
<P align=justify>Jimmy's first motivational talk was a flop. This was when a critic told him, "You will not make it in sales or ever become successful." Something turned and tightened within him, and he decided that he would make it. A commitment was made that day, and he moved forward to experience the taste of success. 
<P><B>Success Comes Through Discipline</B> 
<P align=justify>Jimmy's friend, George Roach, encourage him to read books to gain knowledge about sales, persuasion, negotiation, self-empowerment, business trends, etc. At first Jimmy was not receptive; up to that point in his life, reading was not a priority, not even a pastime. What jolted Jimmy into picking up a book was something George said to him, "Jimmy, if you elect not to read, you are as bad off as someone who cannot read at all." So, at the age of 28, Jimmy read his first book cover to cover, word for word. What an experience. For the first time in his life the words he read came alive. He realized at that very moment that nothing was impossible; he discovered that there is life after high school. He started to attend various seminars and workshops on communication and persuasion skills. Jimmy learned to take the phrase, "Knowledge Is Power," to the next level, which is, "Applied Knowledge Is Power." A lesson he learned, and is now passing on to all his audiences is "Success is not an Art... Success is a Discipline." 
<P><B>A Mission Bigger than Jimmy</B> 
<P>In January, 1983, Jimmy decided to respond to his calling. Becoming a professional speaker became bigger than a choice. It became a desire, a passion, and a commitment to help make a difference in the lives of people. The person that encouraged him and is his biggest supporter is his loving wife, Laural. By establishing and keeping his priorities in order - God, Family, &amp; Career - Jimmy has become inspired to help other find and develop their potential to be successful.ÊBesides his knowledge in communication skills, self-development, and self-disciplines, Jimmy has the unique ability to counsel and guide youth, as well as adults, in the quest for professional and personal goals. His clients are assured success because Jimmy cares and makes certain that they use their hidden talents. 
<P><B>There Is Life After Each Adversity and Challenge</B> 
<P align=justify>Today, if you were to ask Jimmy, "Is there life after high school?" you know he would answer, "Not only is there life after high school, there is life after each adversity and challenge that we may experience. Always remember - 'It is always too soon to quit!'" Through dedication, commitment, and the application of self discipline skills, Jimmy has learned to deal with adversity. By helping others, Jimmy realized he was helping himself.ÊJimmy will never forget who help him - His parents, his wife, Laural, and his friend, George Roach. He knows that one real way to adequately thank them is to continue making a difference in this country and in the lives of others. For every person with whom he comes in contact, he must try to be the best teacher, server, helper, and friend he can be. As Zig Ziglar once said, "See you at the top."
