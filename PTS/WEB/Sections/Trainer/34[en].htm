He focused his research on these issues and soon developed a body of work entitled “Fast Forward: Embracing the Challenges of the 21st Century.” In his Fast Forward work Rick shows organizations why the mindsets, systems and processes they’ve used in the past won’t win today’s never-satisfied customers in a marketplace where supply exceeds demand. He then helps companies redesign their systems to move “Fast Forward” in this new hyper competitive space. </FONT>
