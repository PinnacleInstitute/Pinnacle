Dog is Duane Lee Chapman, owner of Da Kine Bail Bonds in Honolulu and self-proclaimed “greatest bounty hunter in the world.” Six thousand-plus captures over the past two decades have earned this highly intense, charismatic ex-con and born-again Christian such a distinction.
<P>He is the modern-day Billy the Kid — minus all the weaponry. “Regulators,” he’ll often bellow to his supporting cast of bounty hunters, which often includes family members and friends, “mount up!”
<P>He’s also the king of comebacks — a modern-day hero who was once a zero after serving time in a Texas prison for first-degree murder. It’s a conviction he claims was unfounded and later candidly discusses, for the first time ever, with MidWeek.
<P>“I am what rehabilitation stands for,” claims the man who’s been profiled on such TV shows as The Learning Channel’s Secret World of Bounty Hunters and Court TV’s Anatomy of a Crime, and whose Predator’s Predator column at www.crime.com receives a bevy of hits on a daily basis. “I did time in prison, and that made my mother and father — not to mention the public — very ashamed of me.”
<P>And so as part of his penance, he vowed to help make America a safer place for all.
<P>“It’s why I hunt men — fugitives of the law,” says Dog, who also spends a good portion of his time tracking bail jumpers, or skips, between Hawaii and Colorado — where he owns three additional bonding companies. “This is a game of good guy versus bad guy. And I must capture the bad guy!”
<P>Over the years, the list of fugitives Dog claims to have either helped catch or single-handedly brought to justice reads like a who’s who of America’s Most Wanted: Quinton Wortham, Capital Hill rapist; Wayne Williams, Atlanta child murderer; William Scatarie, white supremacist and convicted murderer of Denver radio shock jock Alan Berg.
