                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">It’s called the &quot;graying of
                  America.&quot; More and more of us are moving into our senior
                  years and our life expectancy is increasing. In 2000, there
                  were about 35 million Americans aged 65 and over—more than
                  twice the number than in 1960. The most dramatic increase is
                  in the population aged 85 and older. This is the fastest
                  growing age group and is expected to increase by 200% in the
                  next 20 years.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This growth in the older population will
                  be reflected in an increased demand for long-term care
                  services. While millions of seniors lead healthy active lives,
                  others are not so fortunate. Two out of five persons aged 65
                  and over risk needing nursing home care sometime in the
                  future. As more of us move into our eighties, the chances
                  increase considerably that we will face health problems or
                  need assistance taking care of ourselves. Statistics show
                  that, at any given time, 22% of those aged 85 or older are in
                  a nursing home.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Because women generally outlive men by
                  several years, they face a 50% greater likelihood than men of
                  entering a nursing home after age 65.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As we grow older, we worry about our
                  financial ability to handle disability or illness. But we are
                  unsure about what preparations we need to make. Possibly it is
                  because we don’t understand what qualifies as long-term
                  care, or we believe that Medicare will pay for most long-term
                  services.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What is Long-Term Care?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Long-term care goes beyond medical and
                  nursing care to include all the kinds of assistance you could
                  need if you ever have a chronic illness or disability that
                  leaves you unable to care for yourself for an extended period
                  of time. It ranges from providing personal care at home in the
                  form of help with such activities as bathing and dressing to
                  skilled nursing services in a nursing home. Although most
                  long-term care services are used by older people, long-term
                  care is not only for seniors. It can be needed by a young or
                  middle-aged person who has been in an accident or has a
                  debilitating illness.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The need for long-term care does not
                  mean that a person must be placed in an institution of some
                  sort. Most long-term assistance is provided in home or at a
                  community facility such as a senior center or an adult day
                  care center. Relatives, friends, neighbors and those working
                  for community-based services often provide assistance with the
                  normal activities of eating, bathing, and dressing (see
                  Community-Based Services as a Resource, below).</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Types of Long-Term Care</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Medicare, Medicaid and insurance
                  companies have strict definitions of various types of
                  long-term services, based on where they take place, what kind
                  of licenses and approvals a facility might have, and the level
                  of care they are equipped to provide.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Although this section talks about
                  institutional long-term care, increasingly, insurance
                  companies, HMOs, Medicare and Medicaid are finally adding some
                  home health-care benefits to their coverage. Skilled Nursing
                  Care requires the most medical training and therefore costs
                  the most. A registered nurse (RN) must be available at all
                  times, and care must be supervised by a doctor. Medicare will
                  pay for skilled nursing services only in a Medicare approved
                  facility licensed by the state.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Intermediate Care Facilities also must
                  be state licensed and the rehabilitative care they offer must
                  be based on a doctor’s orders or under the supervision of
                  skilled medical personnel. A registered nurse must be on duty
                  during the day shift. Such a facility may be a special unit of
                  a hospital or skilled nursing home, or it may be a separate
                  facility. Medicare does not cover intermediate care
                  facilities, but Medicaid does, if confinement is based on a
                  doctor’s orders and the recipient is eligible for benefits.
                  Eligibility for Medicaid is based on the amount of one’s
                  income and assets, and varies considerably from state to state
                  following broad federal standards.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Custodial Care requires no medical
                  training–just the skill and patience needed to help people
                  carry on daily activities such as dressing, bathing, eating,
                  and taking medicine. Medicare does not cover custodial care,
                  however, in most states Medicaid covers custodial as well as
                  intermediate care services, if based on a doctor’s orders.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Does Long-Term Care Cost?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The cost of long-term care is expensive,
                  depending on the degree of care needed, and where it is to be
                  provided. As a national average, the cost of a year in a
                  nursing home averages between $40,000 and $50,000. Skilled
                  nursing care at home with two hour visits by a nurse three
                  times a week over a year, would cost approximately $12,500.
                  Personal care at home from a home health aide three times a
                  week for two hours a visit would cost approximately $8,400 a
                  year in addition to medical bills and prescription drugs. This
                  is a substantial amount for anyone, but particularly older
                  persons who often live on fixed incomes.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Pays for Long-Term Care?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Surveys show that millions of older
                  persons mistakenly believe that Medicare covers long-term care
                  services. This is a dangerous misunderstanding because it
                  leads to a false sense of security; seniors thinking they
                  already have coverage for a chronic illness or disability. The
                  fact is that Medicare will not cover most long-term care
                  expenses. Medicare is intended to pay for short-term acute
                  care in a hospital. Medicare will pay 100% of covered services
                  for the first 20 days in a Medicare-certified skilled nursing
                  home and for days 21 to 100 after a copayment of $96 per day.
                  It pays nothing after 100 days. You must meet strict
                  eligibility criteria and a physician must show that nursing
                  home admission is required. The program does not cover
                  custodial care in a nursing home.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Medicare will pay for care in your home
                  only if you are homebound and need, for a limited period of
                  time, part-time nursing or speech therapy, occupational
                  therapy, physical therapy, or a home health aide. This usually
                  means fewer than eight hours per day of help for up to 35
                  hours per week. For very short periods, Medicare may cover up
                  to eight hours a day, seven days a week for a maximum of 21
                  consecutive days in certain circumstances. A doctor must
                  prescribe this care for you to be eligible for Medicare
                  benefits. If your condition improves, however, you would no
                  longer qualify for coverage. Medicare supplement health
                  insurance (commonly referred to as &quot;Medigap&quot;
                  insurance) is designed to help cover some of the costs that
                  Medicare does not cover, but it does not include coverage for
                  long-term care. Medicare supplement policies D, G, I, and J
                  will pay up to $1,600 a year (about 40 visits) for short-term,
                  at-home assistance for those recovering from an illness,
                  injury or surgery. However, no Medigap policies pay for
                  long-term nursing home care.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some life insurance policies have
                  special riders which allow the policy holder to use the
                  policy’s death benefit to pay for long-term care expenses if
                  he or she is terminally ill. These policies pay a certain
                  percent of the death benefit each month the insured requires
                  long-term care. While these &quot;living benefits&quot; are
                  being collected, the death benefit decreases each month by the
                  amount paid. About half of the costs of long-term care are
                  paid out-of-pocket by nursing home residents and their
                  families. The rest of the nation’s long-term care bill is
                  paid by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal state health
                  care program for people with very low incomes and it does
                  cover the cost of long-term nursing home care. Before they can
                  become eligible for Medicaid assistance, many people must
                  spend down a significant part of their income and assets.
                  State laws differ about how much money and how many assets you
                  are allowed to keep once you become eligible for Medicaid. To
                  apply for Medicaid in Utah, contact the Bureau of Eligibility
                  Workers in your local Department of Workforce Services office.
                  Their Internet address is <a href="http://www.health.state.ut.us/medicaid/html">www.health.state.ut.us/medicaid/html</a>.
                  For more information, you may call the Medicaid Information
                  Line 1-800-662-9651 or contact your local Area Agency on Aging
                  and Adult Services.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not all long-term care has to take place
                  in an institutional setting. If you meet income guidelines for
                  Medicaid and frailty guidelines, a state-wide Home and
                  Community Based Alternative Services program will pay for
                  personal care services in your home up to 60 hours a month.
                  Alternative Services can also provide some homemaker services
                  and some respite care. The Medicaid Waiver Program will pay
                  for some personal care services for seniors 65 years and older
                  if they need a nursing home level of care. Again, contact your
                  Area Agency on Aging and Adult Services for more information.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Kind of Insurance Is Available?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In light of the growing number of
                  seniors, the private sector has started to respond with
                  insurance products which help pay for long-term care.
                  Long-term care insurance is similar to other insurance in that
                  it allows people to pay a known premium to offset the risk of
                  much larger out-of-pocket expenses should the policyholder
                  develop a chronic illness or disability.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Standardized long-term care policies do
                  not exist in the long-term care market. Comparing policies is
                  extremely difficult because companies are selling policies
                  with many different combinations of benefits and coverage.
                  Some policies limit coverage for services provided in nursing
                  homes and do not provide coverage for services delivered in
                  home, while others cover both nursing home and home care.
                  Other companies pay for care only if it is provided by adult
                  day care centers or other community-based facility. It pays to
                  shop carefully before you decide if long-term care insurance
                  is a good option for you.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Needs Long-Term Care Insurance?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Your decision whether or not to purchase
                  long-term care insurance and if so, which policy to select,
                  should be based on a number of factors: your total
                  assets/liabilities; your assessment of your chances of needing
                  this kind of care; what services the policy you choose will
                  cover; services that exist in your community; what programs
                  you are eligible for; other resources available to you,
                  especially family support; and whether or not you can afford
                  the cost of long-term care insurance now and in the future.
                  Your personal philosophy about leaving an inheritance also
                  plays an important role in deciding whether or not to purchase
                  long-term care insurance. Another step in your decision-making
                  process is gathering information about the care available in
                  your area and what it costs. What is the average cost of
                  nursing home, adult day care centers, assisted living
                  arrangements or home care in your area?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It is difficult to give any precise
                  guideline about how much income and what level of assets you
                  should have before you invest in long-term care insurance.
                  Your common sense is your best guide. If you must pay the
                  premiums from your savings, or if you would have to make
                  significant lifestyle changes in order to pay premiums, this
                  insurance is probably not for you. The second factor to
                  consider is the amount of assets you would want to protect for
                  your spouse and children. A lengthy, expensive stay in a
                  nursing home could easily wipe out the majority of most
                  people’s assets. The availability of family members or
                  friends to provide some needed care is another important
                  consideration. The presence of a family member often delays
                  the need for nursing home care. Finally, how you feel about
                  receiving Medicaid assistance may influence your decision to
                  buy or not buy long-term care insurance.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Spousal impoverishment rules protect a
                  limited amount of a couple’s assets. At the time of
                  application for Medicaid, a couple’s combined assets,
                  excluding the house, car, and personal belongings, are
                  considered available assets for financing long-term care.
                  Federal law allows a minimum and maximum amount protected for
                  the spouse living at home. Certain assets, such as a principal
                  residence, personal belongings, one car, and a $1,500 burial
                  account for each person are exempt. The remainder is
                  considered eligible to pay for nursing home care.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Other Resources Are Available?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As they age, many seniors fear they will
                  lose their independence because of medical or financial
                  difficulties. The paragraphs that follow discuss some personal
                  and community-based resources that will allow you to choose
                  the level of assistance that is appropriate to your needs from
                  a mix of supportive services.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some families use family care at night
                  and some adult day care or assisted living care the rest of
                  the time as a means of alleviating some long-term care costs.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Savings/Investments as a Resource</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some financial planners and consumer
                  publications say building an economic safety net of savings
                  and investments is preferable to buying long-term care
                  insurance. They base this advice on the fact that seniors face
                  a diversity of economic threats in their advancing years, only
                  one of which is the need for long-term care. Having their own
                  financial safety net allows seniors protection against a broad
                  range of risks. For example, if, instead of buying long-term
                  care insurance, you invested an amount equal to your insurance
                  premiums into a no-load mutual fund, Series EE savings bond,
                  Treasury security or Roth IRA, the proceeds would be available
                  for whatever needs arise. Instead of worrying that your
                  long-term care policy will not cover the amount of home health
                  care that you need, you can use your savings and investments
                  as you see fit. Their use is not restricted or limited by
                  eligibility requirements, expense qualifications, daily

                  <p><font face="Arial">There is a range of services which can
                  be obtained at home or in a community setting. Some of the
                  services available in many communities are described below. To
                  learn more about services and providers in your community,
                  call your local Area Agency on Aging and Adult Services. They
                  do not offer services directly. However, all agencies have
                  trained staff to provide information and who will refer you to
                  needed services.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Resources to Help You Live at Home</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Most older people would continue to live
                  in their own homes if at all possible. Services available to
                  help seniors stay in their homes include homemaker, chore
                  services, assistive devises, companion services, and meal
                  delivery or &quot;meals on wheels.&quot; Contact your Area
                  Agency on Aging and Adult Services and ask for their
                  Information Referral System officer to determine which are
                  available where you live.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Homemaker Services</strong> help
                  with grooming and dressing, light housekeeping, meal
                  preparation and food shopping.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Home Chore Services</strong> go
                  beyond homemaking to include heavy-duty tasks, such as floor
                  and window washing, minor home repairs, yard work, and
                  laundry, and are widely available even in the smallest cities
                  and towns.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Assistive Devices</strong>, such
                  as telephone amplification equipment, walkers, or emergency
                  response systems for summoning help can be obtained through
                  special programs and give the participant a sense of security
                  and allow for independent living.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Friendly Visitors or Companion
                  Services</strong>, whether paid or volunteer, ease loneliness
                  for individuals at home. Their duties range from supervision
                  to simple companionship. Companion services may also include
                  Respite Care, which allows family members to take a break from
                  their caregiving responsibilities for a short period of time.
                  Respite care is also available in adult day care centers,
                  hospitals, or nursing homes.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Home-delivered Meals</strong>,
                  often called &quot;meals-on-wheels,&quot; bring nutritious
                  meals five or more days a week to individuals unable to shop
                  and prepare food on their own. Usually a modest fee is charged
                  for home-delivered meals. These services can provide enhanced
                  nutrition and a sense of security for the homebound, although
                  the number of deliveries can be limited in small population
                  areas. Other programs provide inexpensive meals at senior
                  centers and group settings.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Home Adaptations</strong>, such
                  as grab bars or wheelchair ramps, handrails, improved
                  lighting, secured rugs, bath rails and other assistance help
                  promotes independence and accommodates older people’s
                  changing physical needs.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Home Maintenance and Repair
                  Programs</strong> offer emergency repairs and general upkeep
                  of homes and property.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Home Health Care</strong> can be
                  skilled nursing care, speech therapy, physical or occupational
                  therapy, home health aides, telephone reassurance, or help
                  from home makers. Usually, charges for home health services
                  are on a sliding scale but they can be very expensive,
                  depending on your location.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Telephone Reassurance</strong>
                  is provided by some agencies or volunteer organizations
                  through regular pre-scheduled calls to the homebound. Ensuring
                  personal safety is the main objective of these programs, but
                  these calls also bring personal phone contact to an individual
                  to reduce social isolation.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Community Services as a Resource</font></h4>
                  <font face="Arial">Services provided in the community include
                  senior centers, adult day care programs, nutritious meals
                  served at community locations, protective services, and legal
                  counseling.</font>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Senior Centers</strong> offer
                  older persons an opportunity and a place to meet and
                  socialize. They offer a wide variety of recreational, legal,
                  financial, and counseling programs. These centers, usually
                  nonprofit organizations, may be located in empty housing
                  projects, churches or synagogues.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Adult Day Care Centers</strong>
                  are designed for individuals who live at home, but need
                  company or supervision during the day. This kind of care can
                  be a great help to families caring for seniors but who cannot
                  be home during daytime working hours. Their programs vary, but
                  among the services usually included are counseling and health
                  assessment, personal care, therapies, health education,
                  nutritious midday meals, various social activities, and
                  transportation to and from the center as well as for special
                  outings and doctors’ appointments. The cost of adult day
                  care varies. Some centers will adjust their fees according to
                  the individual’s ability to pay. Nutrition sites offer
                  inexpensive, nutritious meals in settings such as senior
                  centers, housing projects, churches, synagogues or schools.
                  Transportation to and from the site is sometimes provided.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Supportive Living Arrangements</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Individuals who for health, safety or
                  other reasons choose not to remain in their own homes used to
                  have the choice of living with a relative or going into a
                  nursing home. Today, people have a variety of other
                  arrangements to choose from, depending on their physical and
                  mental ability to cope with daily chores. Some arrangements
                  are suited only for alert, active persons; normally, none are
                  suitable for individuals who are bedridden. But many
                  alternative living arrangements can accommodate some physical
                  limitations.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Congregate Housing offers rental
                  apartments for older people. Also known as
                  &quot;sheltered&quot; or &quot;enriched living,&quot;
                  congregate housing may sometimes provide meals in a common
                  dining area as well as housekeeping services. Some may even
                  offer health screening, personal care, or other types of
                  assistance. Many units offer subsidized rent for low-income
                  individuals.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Life Care Communities (or Continuing
                  Care Retirement Communities) combine lifetime housing with a
                  range of services–most notably the promise of medical and
                  nursing care when needed. It is the health care dimension that
                  principally distinguishes Life Care Communities from other
                  types of retirement housing. Although persons must be
                  ambulatory when they move to such communities, if they later
                  become ill and disabled, certain nursing, health and personal
                  services are provided. Other services may include meals,
                  housekeeping, diverse social activities and other amenities,
                  such as personal grooming services and transportation. Most
                  CCRCs require a substantial initial entry fee, depending on
                  the community type and the size of the home or apartment you
                  choose, and monthly fees that may rise annually. Because CCRCs
                  have evolved from the lifecare communities created by
                  religious and fraternal organizations, about 99% of them
                  continue to be sponsored by non-profit organizations. However
                  some hotel chains are showing significant interest in the
                  field.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Shared Housing brings a small group of
                  unrelated people together in a house or apartment. Privacy is
                  maintained, with each individual having his or her own bedroom
                  and sharing only common areas. The housing may be owned or
                  operated by public or private agencies who, in some cases,
                  provide cleaning, shopping, cooking and other services for
                  residents.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Assisted Living Facilities, also known
                  as Adult Care, Sheltered Care, Board and Care Homes or
                  Residential Care, provide what is known as custodial care for
                  people with minimal assistance needs. These facilities might
                  include a room and bath–sometimes shared–along with meals,
                  housekeeping and some personal care. In some facilities a
                  licensed nurse may be available weekdays to provide
                  supervision of medications, and a social worker may provide
                  counseling and assistance in obtaining needed services.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Summing Up</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Every one of us must do our best to plan
                  ahead–for ourselves and our elderly relatives–to assure
                  both quality of care and quality of life in old age.
                  Anticipating long-term care needs can mean checking into all
                  the resources available in your community, such as home care,
                  adult day care, continuing care communities, assisted living
                  programs and nursing homes. It means investigating the cost of
                  these services and facilities and determining what resources
                  you have to cover those costs. It means looking into
                  government programs, private long-term care insurance, and
                  their costs and coverage. Ask questions. Find out what is
                  available. Be an informed consumer. Obviously, the sooner you
                  begin thinking and planning for a time when you or a relative
                  may require long-term care, the better prepared you will be
                  when, or if, a need arises.</font></p>
