                Utilities<br>
                How Can I Conserve Energy? Part 1</font>

                  <font face="Arial">Energy costs are increasing dramatically.
                  The average family can expect to see a 29 percent increase in
                  utility bills this winter. Did you know that the energy being
                  generated for use in the home also increases air pollution?
                  Here are a few inexpensive energy-efficient measures, you can
                  use to reduce your energy bills by 10 to 50 percent and at the
                  same time save energy and reduce air pollution. Control Indoor
                  Temperatures: You can save as much as 10 percent a year on
                  your heating and cooling bills by simply turning your
                  thermostat back 10-15 percent for eight hours every day.
                  Reduce daytime home heating temperatures in winter to 68
                  degrees F or lower.</font>
