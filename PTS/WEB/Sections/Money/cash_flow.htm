                  <font face="Arial">It is difficult to manage your finances if
                  you don’t know how much money you have or where it is being
                  spent. That is why budgeting is an important key to successful
                  money management. A budget has two parts — income and
                  expenses. The object is to keep expenses at or below your
                  income. Sounds easy, but as most have experienced, it can get
                  a little tricky at times. Consider these budgeting tips:</font>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Track the small expenses. This can be
                      done by carrying a small notebook in your pocket or purse
                      for a month or so. List those items you purchase for
                      yourself or others that you often forget to budget for,
                      such as soda pop from the machine at work, a treat for the
                      kids or a donation to a co-worker’s retirement gift.
                      These &quot;budget-busters&quot; can make or break a
                      budget if you haven’t planned for them.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">List expenses. Look through your
                      checkbook for the past few months and write down all
                      expenses. These expenses can then be categorized into the
                      following areas: housing (this includes mortgage payment
                      or rent, a second mortgage and property taxes); utilities
                      (electricity, water, sewer, garbage, natural gas, basic
                      phone and long distance, cell phone/pager, cable TV and
                      internet connection); necessities (food/household
                      supplies, clothing, school lunch, child care/sitters,
                      diapers/formula and child support payments);
                      transportation (car payment/lease, insurance, fuel, repair
                      allowance and license/registration); monthly debts
                      (student loans, other loans and debt including credit card
                      payments); other expenses (laundry/dry cleaning, health,
                      hair and personal care, pet/veterinarian and
                      dues/memberships); education (tuition, books, paper
                      supplies, uniforms, lessons and sports); entertainment
                      (eating out or take out, entertainment debt payment such
                      as a boat or RV, crafts, computer expenses, sports,
                      hunting, bars, gambling, cigarettes); insurance, if not
                      deducted from your paycheck (medical/dental,
                      life/disability, home/renters, co-pays); gifts
                      (children’s allowances, contributions to church/charity,
                      holidays, birthdays, weddings, 1/12 of total holiday
                      expenses).</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Tally expenses. Figure all expenses
                      as a monthly amount. For example, items that are due once
                      a year, such as property taxes, can be divided by 12 to
                      get a monthly figure. Holiday budgeting can be done the
                      same way.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Keep a record. Write down the date(s)
                      you are paid each month. Divide your expenses as evenly as
                      possible among paychecks, taking into consideration due
                      dates. If your largest bills are due at one time, pay
                      several bills early rather than trying to fit them all
                      into the same pay period.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Determine if you need to cut back.
                      Compare your actual expenses to the plan you made. If you
                      overspend in one area, adjust your plan the next month. No
                      spending plan is perfect the first time. If overall
                      expenses are greater than income, it will be necessary to
                      cut expenses somewhere — or increase income. Usually it
                      is easier to cut expenses. Start by determining how much
                      you need to trim. To do this, subtract income from
                      expenses. The figure may seem daunting at first, but if
                      you look hard enough, you can usually find a few items
                      that are easy to cut. Give yourself leeway on one or two
                      things you enjoy. Otherwise you may end up feeling
                      deprived and toss the entire budget.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Consider the envelope system of cash
                      management. Each payday, write a check to yourself to
                      cover food and other out-of-pocket expenses for that pay
                      period. Cash the check and put the cash in an envelope
                      marked for each expense. As you need to buy food, for
                      example, take money from that envelope and from nowhere
                      else. This does several things. It provides you with
                      instantaneous cash management in that you will rarely
                      spend more than allotted. The only way to spend more is to
                      get the money from somewhere else. If you feel it has been
                      a hard week and you deserve to eat out on Friday night,
                      simply pull out the food envelope to see if you can afford
                      it. If you can’t, don’t eat out. You don’t need a
                      complicated bookkeeping system to track your budget. When
                      you spend cash, it hurts a little, so you will end up
                      spending less. It is much easier to sign a check or credit
                      card receipt than it is to lay down cold, hard cash to pay
                      for something.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">If possible, set aside a personal
                      allowance each month. For a single person, a personal
                      allowance allows small indulgences within self-imposed
                      limits. Married couples often find a personal allowance
                      tends to cut conflicts. Two people seldom agree completely
                      on how to spend money. Personal allowances allow each
                      partner to exercise complete discretion over an
                      agreed-upon amount of money without having to answer
                      questions about how it was spent. The Family Life Center
