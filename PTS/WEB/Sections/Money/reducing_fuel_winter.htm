                My Fuel Cost for Winter Driving?</font>
				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Fuel efficient driving is a challenge not
                  easily achieved during winter months when weekly gasoline
                  bills can increase by as much as 50 percent. Of course the
                  best way to reduce fuel consumption is to drive fewer miles,
                  but not everyone has the freedom of this option.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Those who commute to and from work, or
                  take children to and from school, quickly master the
                  techniques of combining trips, planning stops for efficient
                  travel, and carpooling. Many of us schedule our departures and
                  arrivals, and plan out travel routes to minimize the delays
                  caused by traffic congestion. These fuel-saving strategies are
                  very good and when combined with the following suggestions can
                  help reduce your weekly fuel bills:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Tune up the engine. A regularly
                      maintained engine runs more efficiently and is more
                      dependable. Engines that are improperly serviced waste
                      fuel and will leave you stranded at the coldest, most
                      inconvenient times.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Purchase gasoline with the
                      appropriate octane rating. Follow the manufacturer's
                      recommendations when selecting fuel. If your car does not
                      require a high octane fuel, hundreds of dollars can be
                      saved each year by purchasing the lowest grade (octane) of
                      gasoline. If your engine does not knock or ping when a
                      lower octane fuel is used, changing your buying habits
                      will save money.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Inflate tires to the correct
                      pressure. Cold temperatures decrease the air pressure in
                      tires which in turn increase tire rolling resistance and
                      tire wear. Tires should be inflated to the pressure
                      recommended by the manufacturer. Regular tire balancing,
                      alignment, and rotation are important and when selecting
                      new tires, keep in mind that radial designs provide better
                      fuel efficiency.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Remove unnecessary weight from the
                      vehicle. Limit the excess weight to necessary equipment.
                      Gas mileage decreases a mile or more per gallon for each
                      300 pounds of additional weight. The spare tire, equipment
                      to change a tire, a few important car repair tools, a
                      shovel, and basic cold weather emergency supplies
                      (including a cellular telephone) are important, but
                      removing that 400 pound toolbox from the trunk will lower
                      your fuel costs. Also, snow and ice add both weight and
                      wind resistance to vehicles and should be removed for
                      improved fuel economy.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Speed increases fuel consumption.
                      Most of us remember the extensive propaganda that
                      accompanied the nationally imposed 55 miles per hour speed
                      limit a few years ago. Well, the part about fuel savings
                      is still true. At speeds greater than 40 mph, your car's
                      engine must overcome significant wind resistance.
                      Traveling at 55 mph rather than 70 mph can result in fuel
                      savings approximating 20 percent. Slow down and reduce
                      your fuel consumption.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Drive with fuel economy in mind.
                      Those of us who embrace a &quot;zero-to-sixty
                      attitude&quot; are first in line at the next stoplight,
                      but we pay for this in higher fuel costs and more repair
                      bills. When you accelerate slowly and avoid unnecessary
                      braking you are rewarded with fuel savings and less
                      frequent tire and brake replacements. Fuel economy is
                      directly related to conservative driving techniques.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Remove the roof rack when it is not
                      in use. Roof mounted skis and racks reduce a vehicle's
                      aerodynamics. Weekend skiers that use their cars for
                      commuting during the week will improve fuel economy by
                      removing skis and racks when the equipment is not being
                      used.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Pay cash if credit costs more. Some
                      service stations sell fuel at a lower price when customers
                      pay cash, so pay cash and save money on gasoline
                      purchases.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Engine warm-ups require one minute.
                      Waiting more than one minute to warm up your engine on
                      cold mornings is not necessary and wastes fuel. One minute
                      of idling for passenger cars burns as much fuel as
                      starting the engine. An engine block heater is recommended
                      if cold temperatures reach the negative teens, but a timer
                      should be used so the engine is only heated for a couple
                      of hours prior to operation.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Melting ice and snow is expensive. A
                      sure way to increase winter fuel costs is to allow the car
                      engine to melt snow and ice from the car windows. If your
                      car cannot be parked in a garage or shelter, use a
                      combination of sweeping, scrapping, and defrost heat.
                      Allowing the car's engine to do all the work may be
                      convenient, but it is expensive. Also, police caution
                      vehicle owners that an unattended, unlocked, idling
                      automobile, is both attractive and convenient for joy
                      riders or car thieves, not to mention the danger it
                      presents to the general public.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Resist the convenience of the drive
                      through. For those who regularly use a drive through, the
                      best choice is to park the car and go into the restaurant
                      or business rather than sit in the car and allow the
                      engine to idle. Five to twenty minutes of fuel is consumed
                      each time the drive through is used and for those who use
                      a drive through often, this is an unnecessary waste of
                      fuel.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Simple solutions are sometimes the
                      best. The simplest way to reduce winter fuel costs is to
                      drive fewer miles. Replace that regular weekend outing or
                      out of town shopping excursion with an activity close to
                      home. If rising gasoline prices present a problem,
                      consider purchasing an energy efficient car for long term
                      fuel savings and overall economy on a per mile basis.</font></li>
