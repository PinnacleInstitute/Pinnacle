                  <h3><font face="Arial">Health Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your income drop is due to a job
                  loss, layoff, or plant shutdown, an important concern is to
                  maintain health and hospitalization insurance coverage. Most
                  people rely on employer group health insurance to ease the
                  burden of medical costs. But if you no longer have a job, some
                  alternatives do exist.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">First, find out what provisions exist
                  under your company’s group health plan for extending
                  coverage after a layoff. Under a federal law, the Consolidated
                  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (known as COBRA) requires
                  employers with 20 or more employees to offer continuation of
                  coverage for you and your dependents for 18 months. Under the
                  same law, following an employee’s death or divorce, the
                  worker’s family can continue coverage for up to three years.
                  If you wish to continue your group coverage, you must notify
                  your employer within 60 days of your layoff. You will have to
                  pay the entire premium instead of sharing the cost with your
                  employer.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If COBRA does not apply in your case,
                  you may be able to convert your group policy to individual
                  coverage. Contact your employer and their insurance company
                  for your options. One advantage of converting policies is that
                  you may not have to pass a medical exam. On the other hand,
                  benefits may be reduced and premiums will be higher.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Another option on health insurance is to
                  take out a short term or interim policy which is typically
                  written for six months or less. Shop around, compare prices
                  and coverages. If your spouse is employed, check out the
                  possibility of being covered on your spouse’s group health
                  insurance. See if and when your spouse could add family
                  coverage through his/her employer. Many group plans have
                  limited “open enrollment” periods.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Investigate buying insurance through
                  another group such as a fraternal or civic organization,
                  professional association or health maintenance organization
                  (HMO). Group coverage is almost always cheaper than coverage
                  offered by individual policies.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If individual coverage is the only
                  alternative, compare several policies for the best coverage.
                  Individual health insurance is very expensive. It is usually
                  wiser to choose a large deductible in order to lower premium
                  costs. It is better to cover routine medical expenses yourself
                  and count on major medical insurance to cover unexpected,
                  costly illnesses or emergencies.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you don’t have health insurance or
                  can no longer pay the premiums for health insurance, there are
                  limited health services for the elderly, disabled, children,
                  and pregnant women. Check with your county health department
                  to learn about health care programs provided at little or no
                  cost. These may include immunization programs, well baby
                  clinics, blood pressure checks, and other screening programs.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Life Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are two types of life insurance–
                  whole life (sometimes called ordinary life or permanent) and
                  term. If you have life insurance, try not to let it lapse if
                  others are dependent on your income or wage-earning capacity.
                  Your policy could be expensive or impossible to replace when
                  your financial situation improves. Owners of whole-life,
                  variable and universal insurance policies can borrow against
                  the cash value or use their accumulated dividends to keep the
                  insurance in effect. The cash value of a whole life insurance
                  policy may also be used for other expenses. Remember, this
                  loan reduces the face value of the policy until it is repaid.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You may have had group term life
                  insurance through your employer. This is pure protection
                  without a cash value or savings feature. If you are
                  uninsurable elsewhere, you may want to convert your former
                  employer’s group plan into an individual policy. Check with
                  your employer about converting the policy. Individual term
                  life insurance usually provides maximum protection at the
                  least cost. It insures your life for a fixed period of
                  time–usually 5, 10, or 15 years–and benefits are paid if
                  you die within that time period. Shop around; there is a big
                  difference in term policy prices.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Review your needs before talking with an
                  agent. Evaluate any income coming into the
                  household–spouse’s income (if any), interest, unemployment
                  benefits, your debts and your family’s living expenses to
                  help you decide what you can afford in regard to insurance.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Automobile Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Automobile insurance has three parts:
                  (1) coverage for damage to your vehicle, such as collision,
                  fire or theft; (2) liability coverage for bodily injuries,
                  property damages and medical expenses of others when you are
                  at fault, and (3) uninsured motorist coverage to pay for
                  injuries caused by an uninsured or unidentified hit-and-run
                  driver. The State of Utah sets minimum limits for insurance of
                  25/50/15. This means $25,000 for injury to each person in an
                  accident and $50,000 for each accident with a $15,000 property
                  damage limit for each accident. For uninsured motorists, it is
                  25/50, meaning $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. If
                  your policy has limits higher than these and you can’t pay
                  the premiums, consider cutting back to the minimum liability
                  limits temporarily.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your car is not new, one way to
                  reduce automobile insurance premiums is to increase the
                  deductibles for comprehensive and collision or drop these
                  coverages. If your car’s value is really low, consider
                  dropping collision coverage. You may be able to minimize your
                  automobile insurance premiums by checking rates among
                  companies, selecting a higher deductible, purchasing less
                  expensive coverage, and insuring all family cars with the same
                  agent. You may be offered discounts if you are a non-smoker
                  and have a good driving record. If you are planning on trading
                  in your car for a different vehicle, be sure to check
                  insurance rates as they vary considerably by make and model.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Homeowner’s Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Homeowner’s policies protect you from
                  loss of property and legal liability (if, for example, someone
                  slips and falls on your icy sidewalk). If you experience a
                  loss or damage to your property because of fire, storms,
                  explosions, vandalism, theft or snow, most homeowner’s
                  policies will reimburse you for loss or damage to your home
                  and its contents. Coverage is based on the cost of replacing
                  the entire structure, with personal property (such as
                  furniture and appliances) figured as a percentage of that
                  cost, typically 50 percent. Structural coverage should be
                  based on 80 percent of replacement cost for you to be fully
                  protected even for partial loss. Liability protection covers
                  individuals injured on your property, damage you do to other
                  people’s property, and medical payments for the injured.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Renter’s insurance covers the
                  replacement cost of the contents of your home as well as
                  liability protection for injury. There are special policies
                  for condominium owners and owners of older homes.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you try to save money by lowering
                  premium costs, beware of under-insuring. Check your policy to
                  see that it will rebuild your house and replace your
                  possessions at today’s prices. If your 10-year old
                  television is stolen and your insurance only pays what the
                  television set is worth now, you could have trouble replacing
                  it at current prices.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Estimate your insurance needs, shop
                  around, talk with several agents and select coverage that will
                  fit into your reduced income. With all insurance, make sure
                  the company has a high rating with insurance rating services.
                  Consumer magazines periodically carry articles evaluating
                  prices and services of insurance companies and these are
                  available at your public library.</font></p>
