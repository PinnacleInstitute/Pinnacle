                Plan To Pay Creditors and Protect Family Welfare</font>
				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Many circumstances can lead to a loss or
                  drop in income and you may be caught unprepared, with a
                  seemingly endless list of bills to be paid. When this happens,
                  you want to protect your family’s welfare but you will also
                  have to deal with your creditors. It’s important that you
                  not leave the decision-making to others, or to chance.
                  Pretending you have no money problems won’t make the
                  problems go away. You and your family must face the situation
                  honestly. Openly discuss where you are financially with all
                  family members, even children. When children are not included
                  in planning and discussion of spending changes, they may
                  develop unrealistic fears. They may think they are somehow bad
                  or the cause of the problem. If family members have a voice in
                  the tough choices that must be made, they will be more willing
                  to follow through on them.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You will want to talk to your creditors,
                  but before you do, you need to determine how much money you
                  owe and how much money you have to pay your bills. You can use
                  the table below to get started. Figure out how much income you
                  can count on each month and how much you need to pay for your
                  essential monthly living expenses. How long is your present
                  financial situation likely to last? What assets (savings,
                  items that could be sold) do you have that could be used to
                  pay off your debts? Then decide which bills must be paid
                  first.</font></p>

                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Gets Paid First?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You are legally obligated to pay all
                  your creditors. If you can’t pay all your bills, you need to
                  decide how much to pay and to which creditors. One way to
                  decide is to divide all the available money and pay every
                  creditor a share of what you owe. This is probably the fairest
                  way, but it doesn’t always work because each creditor must
                  agree to reduce the amount they receive and extend the payment
                  period.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>What will affect your family’s
                  health and security the most?</strong> A second method is to
                  determine which creditors receive the most money. Think about
                  the worst consequences for your family if certain debts
                  aren’t paid or if less were paid than the amount due. What
                  will affect your family’s health and security the most?
                  Usually rent or mortgage payments, utilities, food,
                  transportation, and medical insurance take priority. Don’t
                  be tempted to let medical insurance slide when money is tight.
                  If anyone in your family becomes ill, uninsured medical costs
                  could be devastating.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>What will you lose if the bills
                  aren’t paid?</strong> You can lose your possessions if the
                  creditor holds the title of the property as security for the
                  loan. Sometimes furniture and large appliance loans are
                  secured loans. If you aren’t sure which loans are secured,
                  check the credit contract. Unsecured debts may have to take
                  lower priority temporarily, although you are obligated to pay
                  them, too.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>How much do you still owe on the
                  loan?</strong> Determine how much you have paid on each loan
                  or contract and how much you owe. If you have only one or two
                  payments left to make on a loan, it’s probably a good idea
                  to finishing paying it, getting that debt out of the way. You
                  may be able to return newer items or sell them to pay off the
                  debt. If you choose to voluntarily surrender the item,
                  you’ll still be required to pay the difference between the
                  market value of the item and the amount remaining on the loan.
                  But getting out from under some of your debts can reduce the
                  pressure you feel.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>What interest rate are you
                  paying?</strong> Credit card firms charging 1.5% interest per
                  month would receive 18% interest per year on the unpaid
                  balances. If you have a loan with a lower interest rate, you
                  may decide to pay off the higher-interest credit card balances
                  first to reduce the amount of finance charges you are paying.
                  Check with your local Extension office for information about a
                  computer program, &quot;PowerPay,&quot; that will help you
                  determine options and costs associated with each option. Until
                  your financial situation improves, destroying your credit
                  cards and closing your accounts may be a good idea. At least
                  put credit cards away in a safe place so you are not tempted
                  to use them.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>What will happen to you if you
                  don’t pay the bill on time?</strong> Is there a &quot;grace
                  period&quot; before the creditor takes action to collect? Is
                  there a penalty or charge for a late payment? Will the
                  remaining balance need to be paid in full if you miss a
                  payment? Will your utilities be disconnected or will you be
                  evicted? If you fail to repay a debt to a family member, will
                  there be hard feelings?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">What legal action has been taken? If you
                  do not want your wages garnished or the item repossessed, pay
                  the debt back as soon as possible.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Contacting Your Creditors</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Once you have calculated how much money
                  your family has for monthly living expenses (see &quot;Setting
                  Spending Priorities&quot; in this series) and for paying off
                  debts, decide how much you can pay each creditor based on
                  priorities you determined while answering the previous
                  questions. Put this repayment plan in writing. Now you are
                  ready to contact each of your creditors to explain your
                  situation and work out a solution. Be prepared to explain the
                  reason you cannot pay, your current income and prospects for
                  future income, your other obligations, your plans to bring
                  this debt up-to-date and the amount you will be able to pay
                  each month.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Don’t wait for your creditors to
                  contact you. They’ll be more likely to work with you if you
                  contact them first. Your past experiences with creditors are
                  important. If you have consistently paid bills when due, your
                  creditors will be more cooperative than if you have frequently
                  been late or didn’t make regular payments. Creditors are in
                  the business of lending money and/or providing services. They
                  want to keep your business, but they also want to get paid.
                  Most creditors will work with you to adjust your payments
                  because they would rather receive smaller payments on a
                  regular basis than to begin expensive collection proceedings.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It’s hard, but visit local creditors
                  in person. Visit the loan officer at your bank or credit
                  union, the credit manager of local stores, and the billing
                  office of your dentist, physician, clinic, or hospital. Some
                  businesses, such as utility companies, have special counselors
                  for customers who can’t pay their bills. These counselors
                  can help you set up a budget plan to even out your payments
                  during the year. They can also tell you if you qualify for
                  fuel assistance or any other available programs.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Contact out-of-town creditors by phone
                  or letter (see sample below). If you call them, write down the
                  name and title of the person to whom you talked. Follow the
                  conversation with a letter, spelling out the agreement between
                  you and the creditor. Keep copies of your correspondence as
                  well as any reply.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As you negotiate with each of your
                  creditors, don’t agree to any plan simply to get off the
                  hook. Establish a repayment plan that is acceptable to both
                  you and the creditor. If you fail to follow through on a plan
                  that you and your creditor agree upon, creditors will be less
                  understanding. If you fail to make the payments, creditors may
                  hire a collection agency to make you pay.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Here are some alternatives to consider
                  when negotiating with your creditors:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Reducing the monthly payment</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Refinancing the loan</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Deferring a payment for a short time
                      if you expect your income will increase soon</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Reducing or dropping late charges</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Paying only interest on the loan
                      until you can resume making monthly payments</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Voluntarily surrendering or giving
                      back an item purchased on credit</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Selling the item and using the cash
                      to pay or partially pay the debt (you are still
                      responsible for any remaining balance)</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not all creditors will be willing to
                  accept alternatives. If you owe a large amount of money, and
                  if your creditors won’t accept reduced payments or a
                  negotiated plan, you may consider taking a debt consolidation
                  loan. You may have to consider more extreme alternatives such
                  as Chapter 13 bankruptcy, or as a final resort, Chapter 7
                  bankruptcy.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Debt Consolidation</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some people prefer to work out their own
                  spending plans and their own arrangements using a debt
                  consolidation loan. The objective of this type of loan is to
                  combine numerous monthly bills into one payment. You arrange
                  for one large loan, pay off all your creditors and make one
                  monthly payment to the lender.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This type of loan may be useful, under
                  certain circumstances, when you are having trouble meeting
                  current obligations. In some instances, you can use a home
                  equity loan for debt consolidation. However, if you are unable
                  to repay a home equity loan, you lose your house.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">With a debt consolidation loan, your
                  monthly loan payment is less than the total of individual
                  debts you had before. You should be aware, though, that
                  commercial debt consolidation and home equity loans cost money
                  and almost always extend the life of your debts. Sometimes it
                  takes twice as long to pay off a consolidation loan than it
                  would have taken to erase each bill individually.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you are considering a consolidation
                  or home equity loan, contact several financial institutions
                  and ask what annual percentage rate (APR) they would charge on
                  a loan for the amount you need. Ask what finance charges are
                  associated with the loan. If you choose this route, be sure to
                  shop around for the best terms. And don’t be fooled into
                  thinking that a consolidation or home equity loan has solved
                  your financial troubles. You will still need to exercise
                  financial care until your income rises again.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Bankruptcy</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your financial affairs have
                  deteriorated beyond repair, bankruptcy is a last resort.
                  Bankruptcy laws were designed to release people from crushing
                  debts and spare them undue harassment by creditors. There are
                  two choices for bankruptcy–Chapter 13 and Chapter 7. Chapter
                  13 is designed for persons who wish to pay their bills, and
                  have a source of regular income. Chapter 13 allows you, under
                  the supervision of a bankruptcy trustee, to work out a whole
                  or partial repayment plan, if creditors agree. Payment
                  schedules can stretch for a period of three to five years,
                  during which time payments are made to the court. Interest
                  charges stop on the date of the filing.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">People often refer to Chapter 7 as
                  &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;liquidation bankruptcy.&quot;
                  Under Chapter 7, a petition is filed for bankruptcy, which
                  includes a list of all assets and liabilities. You are allowed
                  to keep some property, known as exempt items. The rest of your
                  property, with the exception of certain personal possessions,
                  is sold and the money is used to pay your creditors. Chapter 7
                  theoretically wipes the financial slate clean. However, you
                  will still owe any back state and federal taxes, child and
                  spousal support, and student loans.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you’re considering bankruptcy, you
                  will have a number of decisions to make. Is bankruptcy the
                  best solution to your debt problem? Bankruptcy will remain on
                  your credit record for ten years. If you file bankruptcy you
                  may not be able to obtain credit for necessary purchases, such
                  as a car, even after your financial situation improves. Once
                  you have filed for bankruptcy, you are not able to file again
                  for seven years.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial">The purpose of this letter is to inform
                  you that (I/ my family) am having some budgeting and debt
                  problems. I am having trouble making my minimum monthly
                  payment as a result of (a family crisis, a recent job loss,
                  seasonal unemployment, etc.). I hope we will be able to agree
                  upon an acceptable debt restructured payment plan.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">I have taken a careful look at our
                  financial situation. We have set up a realistic minimum budget
                  for our living expenses and have developed a debt restructured
                  payment plan. I am hoping you will accept a reduced payment.
                  Amounts will be increased as soon as possible until the debt
                  is totally repaid. We owe (12 creditors over $7,500). Our
                  asset value is less than ($3,000). Our only assets are (a car
                  with Blue Book value of $1,000, some home furnishings worth
                  $1,500 and our family’s clothing). Our monthly income is
                  ($708). We have ($242) left over after basic living expenses
                  for debt repayment. I would like you to accept a partial
                  payment of ($50) per month to repay our obligation. You may
                  expect the first payment on (date).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">I hope you will find this plan
                  acceptable. I look forward to your letter of acknowledgment.
