                  <h3><font face="Arial">Are You Ready to Purchase a Home?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Owning a home is the American dream.
                  However, that dream can be shattered if you are not prepared
                  for the expense of being a homeowner. The following list will
                  help you determine if you are financially ready for
                  homeownership.</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you have a steady form of income
                      and stable employment?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you plan to stay in the same area
                      for at least three to five years? This length of time may
                      be required to recuperate the costs of getting into a
                      home.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Have you created a budget so you know
                      how much money you can realistically spend for housing?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you save regularly?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Is your current debt low enough to
                      afford a mortgage payment?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Have you established a credit record?
                      If not, can you build a non-traditional credit record?
                      Non-traditional credit is documentation of consistent
                      payments to your landlord, utility company, or even
                      savings account.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you have favorable credit? Do you
                      pay your bills on time?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you have sufficient money saved
                      for a down payment and closing costs?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Have you been pre qualified for a
                      loan? This entails visiting with a lender to see if your
                      income and debt would qualify you for a loan.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Are you willing to make the necessary
                      sacrifices it will take to be a homeowner? These
                      sacrifices may include going without some luxuries to
                      build up your savings for a down payment, future repairs,
                      and even adequate savings to cover house payments in the
                      event you lose your job.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How Much Income Should be Devoted to a
                  House Payment?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Determining how much of a house you can
                  afford is very important. Loan officers may not always act in
                  your best interest. It will be to your advantage to already
                  know how much of a house payment you can realistically afford
                  when you visit with a loan officer. There are two main things
                  that determine your ability to afford a home, income and debt.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Ratios are used to determine how much of
                  a house payment you can afford. These ratios are known as
                  front end and back end ratios. Concerning the front end ratio,
                  experts recommend that no more than 30 percent of your monthly
                  income be devoted to your monthly house payment. Concerning
                  the back end ratio, experts recommend that no more than 40
                  percent of your monthly income be devoted to your monthly
                  house payment and your monthly debt payments. There are many
                  different loans available and each loan has slightly different
                  ratios. You may not qualify for a loan with the recommended
                  front and back end ratios (30/40). If you only qualify for a
                  loan with high front and back end ratios take the time to see
                  if you will still be able to afford the necessities and some
                  luxuries in life before making the decision to accept the
                  loan. This will take sitting down and calculating a budget for
                  once you are in your home. Remember to include items such as
                  utilities and possible repairs if you are looking into an
                  older home. This will be a 15 or 30 year commitment and there
                  are serious consequences for not paying your house payment;
                  you could lose your home.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How to Calculate How Much of a House
                  You Can Afford</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To calculate how much of a house you can
                  afford, start by adding up your monthly debt payments. Then
                  calculate the front end ratio. This will be done by taking
                  your gross monthly income and multiplying it by .30. This is
                  how much of a house payment you could comfortably afford with
                  your income!</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To figure the back end ratio, take your
                  gross monthly income and multiply it by .40, then subtract
                  your monthly debt payments. This is how much of a house
                  payment you could comfortably afford considering your income
                  and debt! Plan to use the lesser of the two figures.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">The Elements of a House Payment</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are four main elements that make
                  up a monthly house payment; they are Principal, Interest,
                  Taxes, and Insurance. Principal is the amount you will borrow
                  and interest is what you will be charged for borrowing the
                  money. The taxes are for the property, and the insurance
                  includes two different types. The first is homeowners or
                  hazard insurance, it is up to you to choose a homeowners
                  insurance agent. This is a yearly payment that can be divided
                  into 12 and figured into your monthly house payment. The
                  amount will depend on the insurance policy that you choose.
                  The second insurance is mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance
                  is a special insurance charged for buyers that make less than
                  a 20 percent down payment. This insurance protects the lender
                  in the event that you default on the loan (or in other words,
                  miss a monthly payment). This insurance is not to protect you.
                  If you miss a house payment you are still responsible for
                  making up the payment. It only takes three consecutive missed
                  house payments to start the foreclosure process. Foreclosure
                  is the legal means of repossessing your home should you fail
                  to make the payments.</font></p>

                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Begin by seeking homebuyer education.
                      You can contact The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
                      Development (HUD) to find an approved homebuyer education
                      course in your area. Visit <a href="http://www.hud.gov">www.hud.gov</a>
                      or call 1-800-569-4287.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Prepare your credit record. Is your
                      credit in good standing? Do you need to improve your
                      rating or establish a non-traditional credit report? (For
                      more information, see Credit found in the Resource section
                      of this site.)</font></li>

                      will be affordable to you and your household.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Shop for a lender. Compare fees,
                      interest rates, closing costs, and personality. Chose
                      someone you will enjoy!</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Obtain pre-qualification. This is an
                      estimate of how much money you could potentially borrow.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Establish your needs and wants in
                      homeownership. Make a list of your needs and your wants
                      prior to looking for a home.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">If you choose, contact a realtor.
                      Realtors are familiar with the housing market and can
                      assist you in finding the house that meets your criteria.
                      The seller generally pays the realtor’s commission.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Make an offer. A realtor can assist
                      you in making an appropriate offer. Offers are usually
                      dependent on the inspection, appraisal, having a clear
                      title, and actually receiving the loan.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Contact your lender for the loan.
                      (Some experts recommend receiving loan approval before
                      making an offer.) This can give you some additional help
                      if there are others making offers on the same property
                      because you will actually have been approved for the loan
                      and not just pre-qualified.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Order a home inspection for the home
                      you want to purchase. Your realtor and lender will have
                      suggestions on who to use. The charge for using a home
                      inspector will be added into your closing costs.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Shop for and choose a homeowners
                      insurance policy. Remember to consider flood and
                      earthquake insurance if appropriate.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Under the Real Estate Settlement
                      Procedures Act (RESPA) you are to receive paperwork that
                      outlines the costs you will incur in receiving the loan.
                      These documents include:</font>
                      <ul>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Good Faith Estimate – obtained
                          at pre-qualification, it lists the charges you will
                          likely pay at closing and give you an estimate of the
                          monthly mortgage payments associated with the loan.</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">HUD-1 Settlement Statement –
                          indicates the actual charges you will have in

                        <li><font face="Arial">Truth-in-Lending Statement –
                          this informs you of, among other things, the annual
                          percentage rate, who will be servicing your loan, the
                          monthly payment, payment due date, number of payments
                          expected with the loan, and any penalties for any
                          prepayments or late payments.</font></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Attend closing. At closing you will
                      sign papers making the sale final. You will be required to
                      bring a cashier’s check to cover the closing costs.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">After the transaction is recorded
                      with the county you can move into the house!</font></li>

                  <p><font face="Arial">Preparing for homeownership can be a
                  lengthy process; especially if you need to reduce some of your
                  debt. Finding a home can even be a difficult task. Remember to
                  communicate well with your family your needs and your wants,
                  and seek further education. HUD approves housing and financial
                  counseling agencies to teach homebuyer education. They request
                  8-12 hours of education to be eligible for financial
                  assistance programs. There are many different assistance
                  programs (financial and educational) available to help
                  families achieve the dream of homeownership. Contact HUD to
                  find a housing counseling agency in your area that can give
                  you more information on available programs, <a href="http://www.hud.gov">www.hud.gov</a>
