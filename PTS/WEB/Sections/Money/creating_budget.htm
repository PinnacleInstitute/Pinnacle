                    <font face="Arial">To get started in setting up a budget or
                    refining your current budget, you need to know where your
                    money is going.</font>
                    <h3><font face="Arial">Tracking</font></h3>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Tracking is an easy way to see what
                    money is coming in, and what money is going out. Start by
                    getting a small notebook or piece of paper you can carry
                    with you every day. Write down what money you gain, and what
                    money you spend. As you make this record, categorize your
                    purchases. This will help when you actually set up your
                    budget. To get the best estimate of where your money is
                    going, you should track for one month. Some like to track
                    every penny; others like to only track variable expenses
                    like entertainment or food.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Tracking your expenses is not always
                    easy. What is important is that you find a way to make it
                    work for you. If carrying a notebook seems unrealistic, save
                    your receipts and review them every week. Remember to write
                    down your expenses in categories.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Tracking may reveal a few surprises.
                    You may discover that you spent much more than you thought
                    on eating out, or on soda breaks at the vending machine. Now
                    that you know how much money you are spending, you are ready
                    to set up a budget. Setting up a budget is simple; determine
                    how much you should spend on food, gas, entertainment, and
                    other expenses. Tracking will help you determine where you
                    can give and take in your budget.</font></p>
                    <h3><font face="Arial">Budgeting Methods</font></h3>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Checkbook:</strong> This
                    method is useful for those who like to pay with checks or
                    use a debit card. In a blank checkbook register, make four
                    or five vertical lines from the top to the bottom of each
                    page; this will be for your categories of variable expenses.
                    In each category write the allotted amount you wish to
                    spend. As you write checks or use your debt card, subtract
                    the amount of the purchase from the appropriate category.
                    Rent and other fixed expenses do not need an individual
                    category, they can just be written in as they are paid.
                    Remember to keep a running total of what is in your account,
                    not just in each category.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Spreadsheet or Budgeting Form:</strong>
                    With a computer spread sheet database, ledger paper, basic
                    budgeting form, or blank sheet of paper, list all your
                    spending categories along the left side. Create a column
                    where you write in how much you plan to spend in each
                    category (use your tracking information) then create a
                    column where you can write what you actually spend in each
                    category. Try not to overspend. At the end of the month
                    evaluate it. Did you overspend or underspend in any
                    category? Now you can make adjustments for next month.</font></p>
                    <p><strong><font face="Arial">Excel Spending Plans:</font></strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="https://powerpay.org/education/budget/Monthly_Budget1.xls"><font face="Arial">monthly
                        spending plan</font></a></li>
                      <li><a href="https://powerpay.org/education/budget/Weekly_Budget.xls"><font face="Arial">weekly
                        spending plan</font></a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Envelope System:</strong> This
                    works well for flexible categories. Use an envelope for
                    expenses such as gas or entertainment. From your tracking,
                    decide how much should be allotted to that category. Place
                    cash in the envelope. Keep it in a safe place to be used as
                    needed. It is easy to see how much is available and when the
                    cash is gone, it’s gone. This can help you cut back in
                    certain categories as well.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Note:</strong> It may be
                    unwise to use the envelope system for large expenses such as
                    rent or mortgage payments; it may not be safe to have such
                    large amounts of cash lying around.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Purchased Computer Programs:</strong>
                    There are many computer programs that can compute a budget
                    for you. However, it is still your responsibility to
                    accurately insert your income and expenses. Some available
                    programs include Quicken and Microsoft Money. They are easy
                    to find and are user friendly.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Variety of Methods:</strong>
                    Many people like to use a variety of methods. Try a few and
                    see what works for you. You may enjoy keeping track of your
                    major expenses in your checkbook or spreadsheet, then using
                    the envelope method for flexible expenses.</font></p>
                    <h3><font face="Arial">Evaluate</font></h3>
                    <p><font face="Arial">At the end of every month, evaluate
                    your budget. Is it working? Why or why not? Make some
                    adjustments and try it again. Sometimes creating a budget
                    works just right the first time, and sometimes it does not.
                    Don’t give up and you will find what works for you.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">How to make a budget successful:</font></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><font face="Arial">Have a personal allowance - Budgets
                        that are created too tight or down to the penny may be
                        harder to keep.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial">Leave room for savings - Savings
                        will allow you to stick to your budget when emergencies
                        occur.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial">Spend adequate time creating and
                        evaluating your budget - It will be easier to follow and
                        understand.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial">Communicate with your spouse and
                        family - Make your family a part of creating the budget
                        and be sure everyone has an understanding of the budget.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial">Have a positive attitude.</font></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3><font face="Arial">Irregular Income</font></h3>
                    <p><font face="Arial">If your income is irregular, take the
                    amount of money you earn in a year and divide it by 12, then
                    use this figure to set up your spending plan. For example,
                    if you earn $24,000 over a nine-month period, but do not
                    work the other three months, set up your spending plan at
                    only $2,000 a month. Discipline yourself to not spend more
                    than the allotted amount each month. This way you will not
                    find yourself financially short in the months of little or
                    no employment. Tracking your expenses during the year will
                    also help you make a realistic spending plan with your
                    irregular income.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Create your budget around your income.
                    If you get paid twice a month, you may want to create a
                    two-week budget. If you have seasonal employment, you will
                    need to have adequate savings for the periods of low or no
                    income. To prepare, begin tracking and start saving even a
                    little money immediately. You may need to track for more
                    than a month to get a good idea of what it takes for your
                    family to live. At the beginning of each month, be
                    determined to only spend that amount. Any extra should go
                    into savings to help you get through the slower months. This
                    will take effort on the part of the whole family. When the
                    family income is high, it may be hard to watch your
                    spending. Communicate to your family the importance of
                    having enough money saved for the off-season.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial">Budgets are a constant work in
                    progress. You will always need to evaluate your budget; it
                    will change as your family, income, job, and even location
                    change. It is all right if your budget is changing, as long
                    as you are the one in charge.</font></p>
                    <h3><font face="Arial">Step Down Principle</font></h3>
                    <p><font face="Arial">You can save money by simply stepping
                    down on your expenses. For example, if you enjoy going to
                    the movies but need to save money, consider stepping down.</font></p>

                    directly to the bottom step you may not be successful. It is
                    easy to apply the step down principle to any expense:
                    entertainment, eating out, purchasing household supplies,
                    the stores and seasons in which you buy clothes, and dating.
                    Be creative. Ask yourself how you can step down. Remember:
                    take one step at a time.</font></p>
