				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Any drop or loss of income forces changes
                  in spending priorities. Although most people do not make
                  immediate spending changes to compensate for an income loss,
                  research shows that the more quickly people change their
                  spending or consider different options, the more satisfied
                  they are with the adjustments they make. When you take charge
                  of your financial situation, you are making a positive
                  contribution to your family’s well-being now and in the
                  future. For many families, the undesirable effects of a cut in
                  income can be minimized by following basic survival
                  principles. Many families realize, after learning to manage
                  their resources better, that their situation is not as bad as
                  it seemed at first. Their income is less than before, but they
                  are doing more with what they have.</font>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Economize</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Economizing means putting your personal
                  and family resources where they do the most good, either by
                  increasing your family’s well being or, in a time of
                  recession, by minimizing economic hardship.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Economizing does not necessarily mean to
                  buy less of an item–it might mean purchasing more. For
                  example, if you determine that home sewing or skill at home
                  repairs would pay for itself by producing income, then
                  increasing spending for needed supplies may be in order. As
                  another example, if you believe a successful job search
                  requires suitable clothing or training for a skill you do not
                  have, spending to achieve these goals may be the most
                  productive use of your limited resources. Keep in mind, you
                  must decrease spending in other areas if your income has
                  dropped.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The economizing principle is: use your
                  resources so they do the most good in terms of meeting your
                  needs in the short and longer term. Part of your resources
                  will be spent to buy goods and services. Another part of your
                  resources should be invested for the future. You might invest
                  in ways to save or earn money or you might invest in job
                  training, a business wardrobe or changing location.
                  Economizing can be achieved in a number of ways: substituting
                  less for more costly resources, finding new uses for resources
                  you already have; conserving resources through wise use;
                  cooperating with others to stretch resources; taking advantage
                  of community resources.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Substitute</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">One survival skill is to substitute less
                  for more costly resources. If you have time and talent that
                  you could substitute for purchased time and talent, do it!
                  Walk–don’t drive–to the neighborhood store. Eat at home
                  rather than out. Cook from basics. Rent costly equipment you
                  seldom use instead of buying. Examples are everywhere, but the
                  most important is developing a habit of asking yourself,
                  &quot;What could I substitute that would do the job for
                  less?&quot;</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Conserve</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Avoid waste, conserve your resources.
                  Keep your family’s health, your skills and your possessions
                  in good condition. Try to get the most use or satisfaction out
                  of each trip in your car, each use of the stove, each load in
                  the washing machine, each dollar already sunk in clothing.
                  Think, &quot;How can I make this last? How can I use it more
                  efficiently?&quot;</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Exploit</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Find new uses for resources you already
                  have. Could you rent a room to help pay the rent? How about
                  renting part of your yard for a garden plot or parking? If
                  you’re driving to work, could you carpool with someone from
                  work and leave your car at home every other day? If you bake,
                  clean your own house, wallpaper and paint, make engines hum to
                  life again, could you expand these into income producing
                  activities? Think to yourself, &quot;What talents, time or
                  other resources do we have as a family that could be put to
                  use in a new, more productive manner?&quot;</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Cooperate</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Resources can be multiplied when you
                  cooperate with others. Food co-ops, housing co-ops,
                  babysitting co-ops, and carpool, organized either formally or
                  informally, can help you and others economize your use of
                  resources. All co-ops work from a common principle–to
                  provide members goods and services at cost or to help members
                  market their products themselves.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Usually members of a cooperative provide
                  some of the organization’s labor. For example, parents might
                  take their children to a cooperative preschool five days a
                  week. Depending on the co-op’s rules, a parent then might be
                  required to work or pay for another person to work at the
                  school one day every other week.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Organizing a cooperative to provide
                  necessary goods and services may help members stretch the
                  resources they have. When considering a co-op of any kind, be
                  sure you understand the operating rules and are confident of
                  the manner in which it is run. Think, &quot;How could I share
                  time or talent with others to stretch my resources?&quot;</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Use Community Resources</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Only a part of the resources you value
                  and use are privately owned. A large share are community
                  resources. Some of them are provided by publicly financed
                  programs such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, or
                  income maintenance programs which are tax supported. Many
                  communities offer free or low-cost health or counseling
                  services ranging from inoculations to psychological
                  counseling.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Other community resources provide
                  entertainment or recreation. These include parks, wildlife
                  areas, museums and libraries. Don’t forget that you and your
                  family need to take time for fun. Get together with friends
                  for a picnic, potluck, board games, fishing or whatever you
                  enjoy. Take advantage of low-cost classes and recreation
                  programs in your community. Personal or family resources can
                  be greatly enhanced through the use of community resources.
                  Think, &quot;How can we use and support public services for
                  our family’s welfare, education, health and
                  recreation?&quot;</font></p>
