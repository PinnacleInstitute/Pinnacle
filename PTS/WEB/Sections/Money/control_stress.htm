                      <font face="Arial">You are experiencing tremendous changes
                      in your life if you have lost a job, experienced a
                      particularly bad year in your farm or business operation,
                      or have gone through a divorce, separation, or the death
                      of a spouse. Crises like these are very stressful in their
                      own right—they force us to make rapid changes in our
                      lives. In addition, however irrationally, they can
                      decrease our sense of self-esteem. Finally, these personal
                      crises often lead to a drop in income and security and
                      this alone can introduce another set of problems.</font>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Because of the stress that can
                      result from these changes, it is important to try to
                      understand causes, effects and ways of handling stress to
                      cope with difficult times. Severe and long-lasting stress
                      from events that cause a loss of income can have a serious
                      effect on a person’s physical and mental health.
                      Stress-related exhaustion is believed to play a
                      significant role in heart attacks, high blood pressure,
                      cancer, and some kinds of arthritis, migraine headaches,
                      ulcers, asthma, allergies, kidney and thyroid disease.
                      Stress alone probably does not cause these disorders;
                      rather it is one factor in their onset and progression.
                      Stress also contributes to many types of accidents through
                      human error, fatigue, worry, and haste.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Stress can be caused by any
                      non-routine experience—physical, emotional or
                      environmental—that disrupts your life pattern. Events
                      such as the loss of a job or a loved one cannot help but
                      interrupt normal daily patterns, although people are
                      different in their patterns of reacting to, or coping
                      with, stress. Despite these personal differences, there
                      are a number of concrete steps you can try that will make
                      it easier to get through difficult times.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">The causes of stress include not
                      only the major life changes mentioned, but also a lot of
                      &quot;little things&quot; that add to life’s daily
                      hassles. If your income has dropped, for whatever reason,
                      suddenly you must cope with this major worry as well as
                      the daily reminders–the bills piling up, the children
                      needing shoes, medical treatment, or school supplies.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Regardless of the source of stress,
                      your body may react to it in three distinct stages: alarm,
                      resistance, and exhaustion. When alarmed, your body senses
                      a threat and prepares for fight or flight. The physical
                      reactions to alarm are a faster heartbeat, rapid
                      breathing, a rise in blood sugar, increased perspiration,
                      dilated pupils, muscular tension, and slowed digestion.
                      The senses become keener and the body is ready for action.
                      In the resistance stage, the body regains its pre-stress
                      balance. However, if the source of stress continues, or if
                      the body continues to respond to danger, it remains stuck
                      in the alarm stage. If a body remains in the alarm state
                      too long, it becomes exhausted, a stage that should be
                      avoided.</font></p>
                      <h3><font face="Arial">Managing Your Well-Being</font></h3>
                      <p><font face="Arial">What can you do? You have found
                      yourself in the middle of a personal, a family, and a
                      financial crisis and you need to be able to maintain
                      control. Concentrate your efforts on keeping your mind,
                      your family, and your body as strong as possible.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Many unemployed people report going
                      through a process of grief and mourning in response to a
                      job loss. This loss is characterized by stages of denial,
                      anger, depression and finally acceptance. With the help of
                      those around them, most people eventually work out ways of
                      dealing with their feelings. They make adjustments that
                      help them recover from their loss and put it in
                      perspective.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Don’t blame yourself for what has
                      happened. In this situation, some people take it out on
                      themselves for a situation over which they have little
                      control. Find support with friends, family and others
                      going through (or who have gone through) similar
                      circumstances. Talk it out, or write down your feelings.
                      Turn your energy into an active sport or brisk physical
                      activity. The anger and depression you feel will gradually
                      disappear. Recognize it for what it is, a natural and
                      temporary reaction.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Don’t keep anxiety and anger
                      bottled up. People are often afraid that if they let
                      themselves acknowledge the anger they feel, they will act
                      on it in a way they will regret later. However, by not
                      admitting to themselves and others close to them the loss
                      and pain they feel, they will be blocked from doing
                      something about the situation. If they get stuck in this
                      stage, it will also prevent them from moving on.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Take one thing at a time. Some
                      changes in our lives are permanent. In time they must be
                      accepted. Until acceptance comes, take one day at a time.
                      Set small goals and celebrate your progress. It may be
                      hard to make decisions at this stage, so ask a family
                      member, trusted friend or professional to help you if
                      important decisions need to be made.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Keep yourself occupied, active and
                      involved. The loss of a job or a loved one can bring more
                      time than you want to think about your troubles. Of course
                      you need to spend time planning your future, searching for
                      a new job or a new identity. But don’t allow yourself to
                      worry continuously about those problems. Spend some of
                      your time doing those family and personal things you have
                      been postponing for years. It may involve work—getting
                      the basement or yard in presentable order. It may be
                      recreation— sightseeing, a picnic, or a ball game with
                      family or friends. It may be volunteer work in your
                      community. Donate some of your time and talents to your
                      church, to a volunteer organization or to someone who
                      needs help more than you do. Doing something for someone
                      else will help them and improve your own self-esteem at
                      the same time. It will also set an example of which your
                      family can be proud. It might even provide a worthwhile
                      entry on your resume.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Keep yourself healthy through
                      sensible diet and exercise. Although your family income
                      may be sharply reduced, it is important to maintain a
                      balanced diet. Spend your food dollar on the best
                      nutrition, reduce alcohol and cigarette consumption,
                      exercise regularly to keep fit, and reduce tension.
                      Maintain health and medical insurance if possible. Loss
                      often triggers depression which is characterized by
                      feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and having no
                      energy. It may be a struggle, but keep moving.</font></p>
                      <h3><font face="Arial">Monitor Stress</font></h3>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Recognizing the early warning signs
                      of excessive stress is an important step in learning to
                      control it. Common reactions to the loss of a job or a
                      loved one include anxiety, moodiness, withdrawal from
                      others, insomnia, poor emotional control, feelings of
                      helplessness and dependency, a decrease in appetite,
                      fatigue, and susceptibility to illness. During a time of
                      emotional and financial difficulty, stress cannot be
                      eliminated but it can be monitored. Recognize the
                      symptoms, especially physical stress such as fatigue. It
                      is important for family members to work together in tough
                      financial times. By taking positive steps such as revising
                      family spending plans and practicing &quot;survival
                      skills,&quot; families can avoid the fault-finding and
                      arguing over money that can result from financial
                      problems.</font></p>
                      <h3><font face="Arial">Handling Stress</font></h3>
                      <p><font face="Arial">In general you can handle stress two
                      ways: work to eliminate the causes and change your
                      reaction to stressful events.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Prepare.</strong> When you
                      are confronting a stressful experience such as a job
                      interview, prepare for it mentally by anticipating a
                      number of different outcomes. Plan and imagine the way you
                      will react to each. A rehearsal can help you cope more
                      effectively and with less stress.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Accept and discuss.</strong>
                      Accept your situation but remember you have control over
                      the unwanted side effects. Look for trouble spots and do
                      what you can to change them. Discuss the situations you
                      find particularly distressing with your family. Work
                      together to reduce the cause of stress.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Clarify responsibility.</strong>
                      Stress on a family can be reduced by clarifying family
                      members’ roles, responsibilities, and lines of
                      authority. Make sure everyone understands clearly what is
                      expected of them. Set clear priorities and tasks. Improve
                      time management. Time, well managed, can help reduce
                      stress. Use time efficiently to look for a job, learn new
                      skills and economize around the house. Substitute home
                      labor for purchased goods. Use time to be good to yourself
                      and your family.</font></p>
                      <h3><font face="Arial">Coping with Worries</font></h3>
                      <p><font face="Arial">If worrying about your financial
                      problem is making your life miserable, analyze your
                      worries. This will help give you a feeling of control over
                      the problem and insight into solving it. Write the name of
                      the problem at the top of a blank piece of paper.
                      Underneath it, list all the reasons it is worrying you.
                      Study each reason–is your anxiety real? Or are you
                      unduly worried? Cross out all the unrealistic worries. On
                      another sheet of paper, list all the worries that remain.
                      Underneath each one, write a specific, practical action
                      you can take to cope with the worry. Then carry out each
                      specific action.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">You may be too close to your
                      problems to see an obvious solution. Sometimes outsiders
                      and professional counselors can help you look at your
                      situation more objectively. Consider getting professional
                      advice if personal, family or financial problems are
                      excessively worrying you. Involve your whole family in
                      reassessing your situation. Take stock of your current
                      expenses, discuss how spending can be adjusted,
                      communicate with creditors, and look again at your
                      financial goals for the next few months. When you spend
                      the time and effort to set mutual, agreed-upon family
                      goals, the decreased amount of money available will be
                      used more effectively and efficiently. Recognize and be
                      ready to manage the down times that will be inevitable.
                      Doing so will help you and your family live with the
                      consequences of an unplanned income change, develop new
                      options, and begin to move on.</font></p>
                      <h3><font face="Arial">When to Get Help</font></h3>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Although most stress can be managed
                      and coped with, sometimes you will need to get
                      professional help before the situation is completely out
                      of control. Resources such as your family doctor, mental
                      health professionals, lay groups, and clergy can help in
                      dealing with extreme levels of stress and the physical and
                      emotional trauma that often accompanies them. Several
                      helping agencies that may be available in your area
                      include human services, community mental health centers,
                      crisis centers, suicide prevention centers, drug and
                      alcohol treatment centers, emergency hotlines, and
                      agencies sponsored by religious organizations. These
                      services are available to people needing or wanting help
                      and many are available at no charge if you cannot afford
                      to pay.</font></p>
