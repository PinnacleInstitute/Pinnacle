                for Cold Weather Comfort<br>
                and Still Lower My Monthly Heating Cost?</font>
				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Monthly heating bills are directly related
                  to furnace operation, and adjusting the thermostat for a lower
                  temperature can reduce your monthly heating bill. Energy
                  efficient heating can be obtained by setting the thermostat at
                  68 degrees F when you are home and awake and at 58 degrees F
                  when you are away or asleep. Although this solution sounds
                  simple, the required adjustments and low temperatures present
                  problems. Someone must diligently adjust the thermostat to
                  realize cost savings and you will regularly arrive home and
                  wake up to a cold house (we'll talk about programmable
                  thermostats in a minute). Also, depending on the age and
                  activity level of those in your home, 68 degrees F may be
                  uncomfortable.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Here is how thermostat adjustment
                  influences energy use. Setting your maximum thermostat setting
                  5 degrees lower, from 70 degrees F to 65 degrees F for
                  example, can reduce energy use by 10 percent. Lowering your
                  thermostat 10 degrees for 8 hours each night during the time
                  you are in bed can save an additional 5 to10 percent. For
                  families that are away from home during the day, lowering the
                  thermostat setting for an additional 6 to 8 hours each day
                  will further reduce energy consumption.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some people mistakenly believe that the
                  energy savings from lowering the thermostat for a few hours
                  are offset by the expense involved in reheating the house.
                  Tests show that lowering your thermostat setting daily for
                  intervals of four or more hours will reduce costs.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Many people have programmable
                  thermostats that use time and temperature settings to
                  automatically control temperature. Families with similar
                  waking and bedtime schedules and regular home arrival and
                  departure times are especially satisfied with the convenience
                  and comfort offered by this technology. A programmable
                  thermostat offers the convenience of automatic temperature
                  control, with the ability to suspend the program and manually
                  control the temperature. If you do not have a programmable
                  thermostat, consider installing one because it can reduce
                  energy use for both heating and cooling activities.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In addition to reduced energy
                  consumption, modern programmable thermostats can relieve the
                  discomfort of coming home to or waking up to a cold house.
                  Models are available with digital displays powered by
                  batteries and can be programmed with ease. Weekday and weekend
                  schedules may be set and furnace operation may be manually
                  controlled to accommodate variations in your schedule.
                  Programmable thermostats that sense occupancy or light are
                  also available and will control temperature based on the
                  presence or absence of people. Many do-it-yourselfers can
                  replace a manually controlled thermostat with a programmable
                  model. Prices range from $30 to $100 (and higher) and care
                  should be taken to select the correct brand for your furnace
                  and wiring. You may want to hire an electrician or heating
                  equipment dealer to replace your thermostat. Personal injury
                  and equipment damage can occur if the wrong thermostat is
                  installed.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Generally the higher priced models are
                  more precise, more durable and more easily programmed. If you
                  decide to do the installation, but want to know how it is
                  programmed, visit a dealer that sells programmable thermostats
                  and have him or her demonstrate the procedure. This equipment
                  can be programmed in much the same manner as the timers for
                  automatic sprinklers and programming difficulty varies with
                  equipment brands.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">An automatic thermostat can be
                  programmed to raise the house temperature before you wake up
                  in the morning and lower the house temperature when go to work
                  or school. Select a model that is easily programmed and has
                  the directions on the unit rather than on an instruction
                  sheet. Make sure it is battery powered or has backup battery
                  power so that the stored program is not disrupted by power
                  outages. Discourage family members from overriding the program
                  to increase the temperature setting.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In addition to thermostat adjustment,
                  here are a few other suggestions to reduce monthly heating
                  bills. Regularly clean and/or replace your furnance's filter
                  and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for schedule of
                  service. Try not to use a space heater because it is an
                  inefficient use of heating energy and is expensive to operate.
                  If possible, close the doors and heating vents to unused areas
                  of the house. Use the sunshine to heat your home by opening
                  the window curtains during the daylight hours and closing them
                  at night. Keep outside doors closed and reduce the traffic
                  going inside and outside. If you are involved in activities
                  that are stationary, try wearing more clothing and/or using a
                  blanket or comforter in your lap.</font></p>
