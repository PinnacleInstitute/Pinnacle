                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">In 1920, Charles Ponzi was a $15-a-week
                  stock clerk in Boston. He learned that he could make a small
                  profit by buying International Postal Reply coupons (IPRCs)
                  which in turn could be redeemed for stamps in a number of
                  countries. If he bought the postal coupons at a low rate in a
                  weak-currency country (as Spain was at the time) and then
                  redeemed them at a higher price in the United States, he could
                  make a profit because of the widely varying rates of currency
                  exchange.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Greed, however, quickly overran his
                  modest intentions and he began to solicit money from other
                  people on the promise that they could expect a 50 percent
                  profit from their investment in just 45 days. This was at a
                  time when normal interest rates were only 5 percent. The plan
                  might have worked had there been enough IPRCs in circulation
                  to support large-scale purchases. But the coupons were
                  distributed in very limited quantities for the convenience of
                  postal customers who used international mails. By the time
                  interest in the scheme grew and Ponzi saw orders flooding in,
                  he was totally obsessed with the idea of making huge amounts
                  of money. He baited the trap by giving some early investors
                  the 50 percent returns promised–using the money of new
                  investors to pay them off. He promised new investors even
                  higher returns, eventually, up to 100 percent.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Within a year, Ponzi had taken in 10
                  million dollars from gullible investors and moved into a
                  palatial home. Even when the scheme was exposed and Ponzi was
                  on his way to prison, money continued to pour into his office
                  from victims who were convinced he had a good thing going.
                  Since then, any operation that pays off old investors with
                  money from new investors is known as a &quot;Ponzi
                  scheme.&quot; It’s similar to a chain letter–it works
                  until it becomes increasingly difficult to find new players,
                  then the whole thing collapses leaving many investors with a
                  loss, not a profit.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Why Ponzi Scams Still Work</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Although Ponzi schemes have been around
                  for more than 80 years in one form or another, and they are
                  one of the easiest swindles to detect, they are more prevalent
                  today than ever before. According to North American Securities
                  Administrators, Ponzi schemes are snaring many investors who
                  have large sums to invest and who are supposedly experienced
                  and financially sophisticated. The reason is the growth in
                  financial services and sometimes bewildering new investment
                  instruments available to the public. In a fast-changing
                  financial marketplace, Ponzi promoters have an increasing
                  number of ways to dress up their schemes and shield them from
                  ready detection.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The range of Ponzi-type offerings is a
                  tribute to the imagination and ingenuity of the promoters of
                  these swindles. They can involve just about any kind of deal
                  you might imagine, from gold mines and synthetic rubies to
                  hydroponic farming, windmills, tropical islands and equipment
                  used in outer space. One Ohio teenager realized that he could
                  use other people’s money to buy rock concert tickets and
                  then turn around and “scalp” them for a 40-50 percent
                  profit. He rounded up his friends to stand in line and buy
                  concert tickets and then resell them. At first he ran his
                  business out of the back of a van, but as the word spread, he
                  soon raked in millions of dollars. When the bubble of this
                  modern-day Ponzi scam burst, the teen would have had to buy
                  every rock concert ticket in Ohio and all surrounding states
                  in order to keep paying out the promised returns to investors.
                  There simply weren’t enough concerts and enough people
                  willing to pay inflated prices for concert tickets. This
                  guy’s friends, and their friends, all lost money on this
                  scheme.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The bottom line for prospective
                  investors is always the same: the guarantee that they will
                  receive higher-than-going rate returns on their investment.
                  Promoters count on investors’ eagerness to leap into a
                  get-rich-quick plan. They rely heavily, too, on what has been
                  described as the &quot;herd instinct.&quot; The start-up may
                  be slow, with only a trickle of investors willing to take the
                  bait. But once the plan builds momentum, word of mouth alone
                  is almost enough to spin the operation into high gear. For
                  this reason, Ponzi promoters focus their initial efforts with
                  demography in mind. They may confine their efforts to
                  professional football players or concentrate on a large church
                  congregation, a single retirement community, or an Air Force
                  base.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Early participants in Ponzi scams are
                  often rewarded with high returns on their initial investment.
                  Promoters know that word of a few successful participants will
                  spread rapidly to others. However, many of these early
                  investors are so elated with their financial killings they
                  turn right around and put their money back into the scheme,
                  often losing almost everything in the end.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How Can You Protect Yourself?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Ignore promises of high, guaranteed
                  profits, the trademark of the Ponzi scam. Legitimate
                  investments not only address themselves conservatively to any
                  discussion of profits but rigorously avoid any promise of
                  specific percentages over any given period.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Avoid any kind of investment that is not
                  described clearly, in detail, and without hedging. Swindlers
                  often declare that the specifics are &quot;too technical&quot;
                  to describe in layman’s language. They may also avoid
                  mentioning names on the grounds that the geniuses behind the
                  plan &quot;wish to remain anonymous.&quot; Why would you
                  invest in something you don’t understand by somebody who
                  won’t give his or her name?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Check out the promoters’ credentials
                  and background carefully through reliable sources that can
                  alert you to any illegal acts or questionable practices that
                  may color their records.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Obtain information about the proposed
                  offering from your state's Division of Securities. If you
                  detect or suspect any violations of the law or securities
                  registration, do other investors a favor by reporting your
                  doubts to these organizations or your state's Division of
                  Consumer Protection.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Demand detailed information in writing.
                  You are well within your rights to ask for documentation. Be
                  concerned if the promoter is reluctant or hedges by asserting
                  that such information is &quot;confidential.&quot; It’s your
                  money!!</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Just because a promoter of a plan makes
                  a claim doesn’t mean it’s true! Verify any and all claims
                  and promises made by the promoter. Swindlers often try to
                  imply that the offering is registered with a government
                  agency, has Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s stamp of approval, or has
                  been cleared through a trust company. Don’t accept such
                  claims at face value.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Seeing is believing.&quot; Ask to
                  visit the plant where the &quot;fabulous new product&quot; is
                  being manufactured. If it’s &quot;off limits to everyone but
                  employees,&quot; be suspicious.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Back away from plans that offer
                  &quot;deferred&quot; payments, where you have to invest today
                  but will not see any products or evidence of ownership until
                  tomorrow, or where you are pressured into reinvesting or
                  letting your profits &quot;roll over.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Be on the alert for any kind of
                  unbusinesslike conduct on the part of the promoters, including
                  the inability to reach them through phone calls, by mail or by
                  e-mail. The farther along the road to disaster a Ponzi plan
                  may be, the more impossible it becomes for investors to obtain
                  information or get through to the promoters.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Ponzi scams are not pyramid schemes.
                  Although closely related in the minds of many, the classic
                  Ponzi amounts to little more than robbing an army of Peters to
                  pay a handful of Pauls. A pyramid scheme is a plan in which
                  people invest in the right to sell the investment. They are
                  alike in that both are illegal and both will continue to part
                  fools and their money.</font></p>
