                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Many circumstances can lead to an abrupt
                  reduction in income: a company layoff or cutback, loss of a
                  job, reduced farm income, or loss of a second income from a
                  spouse. Just the threat of any of these situations is a
                  serious blow to individuals and families struggling to survive
                  economically in difficult times.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If economic misfortune strikes you or
                  your family in the form of reduced income, is there anything
                  you can do to minimize the hardship? Yes!</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Abrupt loss of income, whatever the
                  reason, is traumatic. Often the financial setback was not
                  anticipated. When it happens, a common instinct is to panic.
                  Although natural, the temptation to tailspin needs to be
                  avoided. Remember the following facts:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Loss of income affects many people
                      for many different reasons. It may be caused by a loss of
                      a job, a softening of the economy, an illness or death,
                      poor return on an investment, or a divorce. It doesn’t
                      help to blame yourself. Chances are it wasn’t your
                      fault. In any event, self-blame wastes energy, and the
                      energy you spend blaming yourself could be better spent on
                      dealing with your situation.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Feeling the effects of stress is very
                      human and very natural. That doesn’t make it pleasant.
                      Keep stress at controllable levels by recognizing the
                      signs and taking steps to reduce stress. Developing and
                      following a plan will reduce stress and help you maintain
                      control of your financial position.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">One important way to cut anxiety is to
                  assure yourself you are doing the best you can with the
                  resources you have. You are also encouraged to learn about
                  community resources designed to help you and others in times
                  of economic or personal distress. Sometimes people are
                  reluctant to ask about &quot;government programs&quot; in
                  times of trouble. However, these are ways in which you and the
                  community, have tried to protect our mutual welfare with
                  programs to assist in times of trouble.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">After you know the resources you have
                  and are likely to have, talk with your family about how you
                  and they use money. Designing a family spending plan
                  accomplishes two things. It sets your family up for success by
                  thinking positively. And it helps you to survive financially
                  and emotionally until future goals are decided.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">One of the most stressful outcomes of a
                  loss in income is the worry that creditors are all around,
                  impatiently waiting for you to pay overdue bills. In this
                  situation, avoidance is not the answer. It is extremely
                  important for you to be realistic about your financial
                  situation and meet it with a plan. Fears caused by uncertainty
                  and avoidance are always worse than facing the facts and
                  following a plan to take control.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Keeping a roof overhead, the utilities
                  hooked up, and essential insurance are top priorities when
                  income drops.</font></p>
