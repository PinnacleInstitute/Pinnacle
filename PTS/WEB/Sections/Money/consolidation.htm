				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Debt consolidation is an option that allows
                  you to take your debts and lump them together under one
                  interest rate and make only one payment. This works for some
                  individuals, but not for others. In order to consider a debt
                  consolidation program, you need to have more than one debt.
                  Consolidation loans typically give you a lower monthly
                  payment; however, this will mean extending the length of time
                  you pay on the loan. As a result, you will pay more in
                  interest because your loan will be longer. It is important to
                  shop around for a debt consolidation loan. There are reputable
                  companies as well as companies that are just out to make a
                  dollar at your expense.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A debt consolidation company, just like
                  other creditors, will want information from you in order to
                  determine if you qualify for their services. They should
                  examine your financial situation: income, expenses, and
                  creditors. If they can assist you, they will then attempt to
                  stop charges and lower your interest rates by negotiating with
                  your creditors.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Consolidation Program Options</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Typically there are two options in a
                  debt consolidation service: debt management plans/programs and
                  debt settlements.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Debt Management Plans/Programs</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The consolidation company will need an
                  overall idea of your financial situation; income, expenses
                  etc., then they will negotiate with your creditors as
                  mentioned above. You will then be responsible for making a
                  monthly payment to the consolidation company that they will
                  distribute to your creditors. For this plan to work, you must
                  not take on any more debt, and you must make your payments to
                  the consolidation company on a regular basis.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Debt Settlements</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The consolidation company will most
                  likely negotiate a settlement amount with your creditors.
                  Sometimes doing this can cut your balance significantly. A
                  lump sum is typically required to achieve this type of
                  settlement, so it is important to have the requested lump sum
                  at the time of settlement. Fees for a debt settlement may
                  include set-up fees, administration fees, a percentage of the
                  amount you will save from the settlement, and there may also
                  be tax penalties. Before choosing a debt settlement plan,
                  discuss possible tax penalties with a tax professional.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Both of these options can be
                  accomplished with the help of a financial counselor, or by
                  yourself, at no cost. Not all creditors will be willing to
                  work with just you, a financial counselor, or even a
                  consolidation company, but it is worth a try! It is important
                  to know that consolidation companies typically do not help
                  with all debt. There are some companies they are contracted to
                  work for and others they are not. Creditors want to get their
                  money back and will usually work with you. However, if you
                  have let your debt go too far, creditors are less likely to
                  accommodate you; for example, if your debt has gone to
                  collections, or if your wages are being garnished.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Researching a Consolidation Company</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Before using debt management or
                  consolidation companies research them thoroughly since there
                  has been abuse in the industry.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Research the Company</font></h4>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <font face="Arial">Thoroughly examine their Web site. Are they
                  approved by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC)
                  (www.nfcc.org)? Have they ever gone by another name? If so,
                  contact the Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org) to see if
                  there have ever been complaints made against the company.</font>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Call the Company</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Call the company to see what information
                  they will tell you about their program. Call more than once.
                  Some companies may give different information or not all the
                  information in the first call. More information could also be
                  sent to you through email. As you investigate the company’s
                  program, take note of information that varies from one
                  representative to the next. This may be a sign of hidden fees.
                  Do not feel obligated to give any personal information over
                  the phone. Let the representative know you are researching
                  different companies and will not be giving out your personal
                  information until you have decided on a company. Do not be
                  pressured into signing up with their company on the first
                  phone call.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Questions to ask the company when you
                  call:</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Are they only Internet based, or do
                      they have an office you can visit?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Are they accredited through the NFCC?
                      If not, see if they have the following criteria. (Even if
                      they are not NFCC accredited they should be meeting these
                      standards.)</font>
                      <ul>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Certified counselors</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Voluntary board of directors</font></li>

                        <li><font face="Arial">Nominal fee structure</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Community representation</font></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">What are their fees?</font>
                      <ul>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Ask for all fees to be disclosed
                          to you with an explanation of each. Inquire about
                          start-up/enrollment fees, monthly fees, late fees,
                          charges per account, and hidden fees.</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Are donations required? Will you
                          be asked to make a voluntary contribution? What
                          defines a voluntary contribution? Some companies are
                          specifically set up as non-profits, thus allowing them
                          to write off any donations.</font></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">What kind of payment process do they
                      have? Payments should go from you to the company and then
                      to the creditors.</font>
                      <ul>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Will your first payment be sent
                          to your creditors or will it be kept by the company?
                          If the company will be keeping your first payment you
                          will need to also pay your creditors that first month
                          to avoid late fees and possibly disqualifying yourself
                          from the company’s consolidation plan.</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Inquire if there will be any
                          electronic transfers or direct deposits required, or
                          if payments will be manual. It will be important for
                          you to track everything—getting statements or
                          receipts from your bank, the company, and your
                          creditor to ensure that the payments are being made.</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Can all debts be taken care of
                          through the company, or just the creditors that
                          contribute to the company? Who are those contributors?</font></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do they have an interest in helping
                      you as a customer become more financially sound? (Or do
                      they just want your money?) Do they offer any budget or
                      debt counseling? Do they offer financial education courses
                      free of charge?</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Choosing to use a consolidation company
                  can be helpful, but there is still a great amount of
                  responsibility for you to ensure that everything is running
                  smoothly. Fraud and mistakes happen. If you are aware of what
                  is going on with your payments and the company, you will be
                  more likely to avoid problems.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you feel your debt is too large to
                  manage by yourself, contact a local financial counseling
                  agency for help.</font></p>
