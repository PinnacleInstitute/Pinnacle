                  <h3><font face="Arial">What is Estate Planning?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Estate planning is nothing more than
                  developing a process for identifying and transferring all of
                  your property from one generation to the next or within a
                  generation. Estate planning isn’t only for the rich; there
                  are no minimum property requirements. Anything that you care
                  about–from an old rocking chair that belonged to your
                  grandfather to a cabin where your family spends all its
                  vacations–is important enough to justify at least basic
                  estate planning. Sometimes young families think they don’t
                  have enough property to justify estate planning. But if you
                  have a child under age 18, you have estate planning concerns.
                  Who will raise your child if you can’t? Who will manage any
                  cash or assets the child might inherit?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This publication is designed to help you
                  begin the estate planning process. It is not intended to
                  substitute for the assistance and advice of a lawyer. But it
                  is intended to clarify some of the issues and language
                  involved in estate planning so that you can figure out what
                  you want to accomplish with your estate plan.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">It’s Easier To Put It Off</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">One reason that people put off estate
                  planning is because it involves more than listing what you own
                  and who you want to have it when you are gone. It involves
                  attitudes and feelings about death, property ownership,
                  business arrangements, marriage and family relationships.
                  Sometimes adult children will put off talking with their
                  parents about their estate because they don’t want to appear
                  greedy, or because they can’t imagine a time when their
                  parents won’t be around. Sometimes parents avoid talking to
                  their adult children about estate planning because they
                  don’t want to hurt feelings, or they truly aren’t aware of
                  all the options that are available to them. As uncomfortable
                  as talking about death might be now, isn’t it worth spending
                  some time and money to avoid the confusion, delay, expense and
                  quarreling that might occur if you died without a plan? If you
                  don’t make a plan, Utah law will decide what happens to your
                  estate, and it might not be what you would want at all.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Dying Without a Will or Trust</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Most people don’t intend to die
                  without a will (or trust), but it does happen fairly often. If
                  you die leaving no will, your property will be distributed
                  according to Utah law. Under state laws, if you are married
                  with no children, your property will pass to your surviving
                  spouse. This is also true if all your children are the
                  biological children of both of you. If you are married but
                  have children who are the child of one but not the other
                  spouse, the property is divided: one-half to the surviving
                  spouse and the other half in equal shares to children of the
                  deceased. If you are unmarried with no children, your property
                  will pass to your parents. If you have no surviving parent,
                  your property will pass to your brothers and sisters or to the
                  children of deceased brothers or sisters. If you are unmarried
                  with children, your property will pass in equal shares to your
                  children. The court will appoint a conservator/guardian to
                  handle the assets of any child under age 18.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Before You Visit an Attorney</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Before visiting an attorney who will
                  transform your wishes into a written legal document, take some
                  time to organize what you will need. Inventory your assets and
                  try to put a price tag on each one. Assets are things you own
                  with an economic value–houses, cars, stocks, bonds,
                  annuities, furniture and appliances. If you’re not sure of
                  the value of some items, there are information sources that
                  can help.</font></p>

                      value of your house or other real property, consult a real
                      estate agent, your municipal (or county) property
                      assessor, or your last property tax bill. The principal
                      owed on a mortgage is usually available on quarterly or

                      The cash value is the amount of money the insurance

                  <p><font face="Arial">As you collect this information, be as
                  accurate as you can, but don’t get bogged down in being
                  correct to the penny. Your goal is to put together a list of
                  what and how much you own so you can make decisions about its
                  disposition.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Are Your Beneficiaries?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In an estate plan, beneficiaries are the
                  people and organizations to which you leave your property.
                  Most people have a pretty good idea of who their direct
                  beneficiaries will be. Couples in second, or subsequent
                  marriages may face more complicated decisions if there are
                  children from a prior marriage involved. The usual legal tool
                  for handling this kind of issue is a particular type of trust.
                  But in a simple beneficiary situation, the plan maker’s
                  choices are usually clear.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You also need to think about alternate
                  beneficiaries–people or organizations that would receive
                  your property should a direct beneficiary not outlive you. You
                  can name one or two alternate beneficiaries for every one of
                  your direct beneficiaries. Naming alternate beneficiaries
                  eliminates the risk that you won’t get around to amending
                  your will or living trust if one of your direct beneficiaries
                  predeceases you.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Do You Have Young Children?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Parents of children under the age of 18
                  have two estate planning concerns. The first is providing for
                  the custody of their children should both of them die at the
                  same time. Then, because minors cannot legally own any
                  significant amount of property, nominating an adult to
                  supervise and manage any assets the child would inherit. The
                  same person may fulfill both roles, or one individual may be
                  named as the children’s guardian and another as financial
                  manager or conservator.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The person you name as a child’s
                  personal guardian cannot actually serve as legal guardian
                  until approved by a court. This is because children are not
                  property and cannot be &quot;left&quot; to someone as you
                  could a piece of property. You should always name a successor
                  personal guardian in case your first choice is unable to serve
                  or continue to serve. “Blended” families can raise complex
                  estate planning concerns. People who have been married more
                  than once may have trouble reconciling their beneficiary
                  desires for their present spouse (and family if the couple has
                  children from their present relationship) with their wishes
                  for children from prior marriages. Here a trust can be very
                  useful, providing for a current spouse while still keeping
                  some property intact for your children.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When there is a family member who will
                  never be able to care for himself or herself, estate planning
                  is more complicated. Providing care and support for these
                  children often requires the help of experts, particularly to
                  coordinate the parents’ support with rules on government
                  benefits. Parents must choose a personal guardian to be
                  responsible for the disabled child until he or she becomes a
                  legal adult at age 18, and a financial manager to supervise
                  any money or property they leave for the care of the child for
                  as long as the child lives.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What is Probate?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Once you know what money and property
                  you have, you need to determine which is probate property and
                  which is non-probate property. Probate is a legal process to
                  determine who should receive a person’s property at death,
                  who should handle their business affairs, such as paying
                  bills, and who should care for any minor children and their
                  assets. Probate operates according to state law and because
                  Utah is one of the states that has adopted the Uniform Probate
                  Code (UPC), it is a relatively simple and inexpensive process.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not all property a person owns is
                  subject to probate. Property held in joint tenancy with right
                  of survivorship; property held in a trust; life insurance or
                  retirement funds payable to a named beneficiary;
                  payable-on-death checking and savings accounts (POD), and
                  registrations on securities and securities accounts are all
                  examples of non-probate property. Probate property is all that
                  you own that does not, by the way it is titled, have
                  survivorship rights. Examples of probate property are your
                  share of property owned as tenants in common, your share of
                  household goods, and property owned only by you. Probate
                  property is distributed at death according to the directions
                  in your will or under the laws of Utah if you do not have a
                  will.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Methods for Transferring Your Property
                  When You Die</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Now that you know how much property you
                  have and how title for the property is held, you can decide
                  whether you need a will or a trust to dispose of your assets
                  when you die.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Wills</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A will is a written document that
                  describes how its maker wants property distributed after his
                  or her death. By making a will, an individual can decide who
                  shall receive his or her property, how much each will receive,
                  and when they shall own it. A will has no effect during the
                  testator’s (the person making the will) lifetime. Only upon
                  death does a will disposing of the testator’s property
                  become effective.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Anyone 18 years of age or older can make
                  a written will. Although a person can make his or her own
                  hand-written will, in most cases, it is best to consult with a
                  lawyer to be sure your written document will accomplish your
                  objectives. If you have an attorney for other purposes,
                  consult that attorney about writing your will. If he or she
                  does not do estate planning, they may suggest another
                  attorney. If you do not have an attorney, a relative or friend
                  may be able to suggest one. Failing this, check with people
                  you know in any business or social organization with which
                  you’re involved, especially those with a large number of
                  members over age 40. Be sure to ask any attorney whose name
                  you get from the Service about his or her credentials and
                  experience. Before choosing your estate planning lawyer, try
                  to interview at least three attorneys to find the one who is
                  right for you and your estate planning needs and concerns.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some financial and legal experts advise
                  against a simple will citing the time and expense of probate,
                  loss of privacy, and other concerns. If your estate planning
                  involves complex arrangements, if you have substantial probate
                  assets, or if you wish to make arrangements in the event of
                  incompetency, a revocable living trust may be the best estate
                  planning tool. However, if it appears from an inventory and
                  appraisal that the value of the probate-able estate does not
                  exceed $25,000, less reasonable funeral expenses and costs of
                  any last illness, it can be settled quickly and inexpensively
                  in a small estate probate procedure.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Revocable Living Trusts</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A revocable living trust is a legal
                  arrangement by which an individual shifts ownership of
                  property (such as a home, real estate, bank accounts,
                  certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, or life insurance)
                  from personal ownership into the legal ownership of the trust.
                  A revocable living trust is just what the name implies–one
                  that is created during an individual’s life, but that can be
                  changed or terminated at any time.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The person whose assets are placed in
                  the trust is called the trustor or grantor. The grantor must
                  actually change the title of ownership of each asset that will
                  be placed in the trust from his or her name to ownership by
                  the trust. Merely setting up a trust agreement does not place
                  any property into the trust–a separate transaction is needed
                  to transfer ownership of each asset. For example, you have to
                  go to the bank and fill out a form to change the name on your
                  checking and savings accounts and to the County Recorder’s
                  office to change the title on your home from “Michael D.
                  Kelly” to the “Michael D. Kelly Living Trust.” The cost
                  to transfer property is usually minimal, but it takes time to
                  organize your papers and make the transfers. As you acquire
                  new property, you must also take care to place it in the
                  trust’s name and not your own. About 49% of all people who
                  have living trusts never complete this second step, which
                  pretty much negates the advantages of setting up a trust. Some
                  attorneys, as part of setting up the trust document, will
                  “fund” the trust for you, meaning he or she will change
                  the title of your assets from your name to the trust name.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A revocable living trust has advantages
                  and disadvantages. One of the advantages of a trust is in the
                  event of incompetency. Advanced age, a serious illness, or
                  even an accident may cause a person to be incapable of either
                  supervising his or her assets or making necessary payments for
                  his or her wellbeing. A living trust is an effective tool for
                  handling your financial affairs if you become incompetent. The
                  trust agreement tells how and who is to determine you are
                  incompetent, and directs how your financial affairs are to be
                  managed by the successor trustee.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you have substantial probate assets,
                  a living trust allows your estate to avoid the time and
                  expense of probate. Assets owned by a revocable living trust
                  are non-probate assets. The trustee (the person who manages
                  the assets in the trust) already has legal title to the trust
                  assets and can transfer title, without probate, to the
                  beneficiaries named in the trust agreement.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A living trust will cost more and take
                  more time to set up than would preparing a will. Having all
                  your property in a trust may make it more difficult to deal
                  with stockbrokers, bankers, and insurance companies. They need
                  to know who has what powers under the trust agreement. Many
                  financial institutions will not loan money to a trust. For
                  example, if you wanted to refinance your home mortgage and
                  your home is owned by the trust, you might have to transfer
                  the house out of the trust, complete the refinancing, and then
                  transfer the house back into the trust. Insurance companies
                  may be unwilling to insure vehicles owned by a trust,
                  maintaining that they can’t determine who the authorized
                  drivers are.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Trusts do not provide any income tax
                  savings. Income earned in a revocable living trust is taxed to
                  the grantor (trustor), and must be reported on his or her
                  personal state and federal income tax returns. State and
                  federal law requires the value of all property and assets be
                  incorporated into the grantor’s estate upon death and so
                  they must be included when federal estate taxes are determined
                  (in 2002, estates under $1 million were exempt from federal
                  estate taxes, with the amount gradually increasing to $3.5
                  million in 2009). Trusts also do not protect assets from
                  nursing home costs. Since the revocable living trust can be
                  changed at any time by the person who formed it, the income
                  and assets in the trust are considered available to cover
                  nursing home costs under current Medicaid rules.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Even though you have a trust, you will
                  still need what is called a “pour-over” will. You can’t
                  use any other device except a will to name a personal guardian
                  for your minor children. Also you can use your will to appoint
                  a financial manager for any assets your children may inherit.
                  You may also acquire property that you don’t have time to
                  transfer into your trust before you die. A pour-over will says
                  anything you own at death passes to the trust. A pour-over
                  will also acts as a backup in order to pass on items such as
                  jewelry and furniture that don’t have a legal title.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Other Ways of Transferring Property</font>
                  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
                  <font face="Arial">People sometimes use different forms of
                  property ownership to accomplish their estate planning goals.
                  For example, a simple pay-on-death (POD) bank registration is
                  usually a better way to handle your checking account than a
                  living trust. All you do to set up a POD account is name, on a
                  form provided by the bank, one or more persons you want to
                  receive any money in the account when you die. You can do this
                  with any kind of bank account, including savings, checking or
                  certificate of deposit accounts. Banks don’t charge more for
                  keeping your money this way. During your life, the beneficiary
                  has absolutely no right to the money in the account. You can
                  withdraw some or all of the money, close the account or change
                  the beneficiary at any time. When you die, the beneficiary
                  claims the money simply by showing the bank the death
                  certificate and personal identification.</font>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Utah is one of the states that has
                  adopted the Uniform Transfers-on-Death Security Registration
                  Act, where you can add a transfer-on-death designation to
                  individual securities (stocks and bonds) or securities
                  accounts. Securities accounts are broker-held accounts for
                  your stocks, bonds, mutual funds or similar investments. With
                  a Transfer-on-Death registration on file, no probate is
                  necessary. After your death your beneficiary or beneficiaries
                  will receive these securities promptly. Some property owners
                  will hold their real and personal property in joint tenancy
                  with rights of survivorship. This property does not go through
                  probate. However, common ownership in and of itself does not
                  create a right of survivorship. Property held as tenants in
                  common or in corporate or partnership arrangements would still
                  have to go through probate.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Joint tenancy can be desirable for
                  people who buy property and want to share ownership, including
                  inheritance rights. But transferring property from sole
                  ownership to joint tenancy with someone else simply to avoid
                  probate creates several problems that wouldn’t occur if a
                  living trust was used instead. For example, if you make
                  someone else a joint owner of property that you now own
                  yourself, you give up half-ownership of the property. The new
                  owner can sell or mortgage his or her share, or it could be
                  lost to their creditors in a severe debt situation. Also, if
                  one of the joint tenants became incapacitated and could not
                  make decisions about the property, the other owner would have
                  to go to court to get the authority to sell it or obtain a
                  mortgage. In addition, if you make another person a co-owner
                  by creating a joint tenancy, and exceed federal gift tax
                  limitations, a gift tax may be assessed.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Transferring Retirement and Pension
                  Assets</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In addition to Social Security, savings
                  and investments, many people contribute to one or more
                  retirement programs that will assure them an income when they
                  get older. At your death, whatever funds are left in accounts
                  that are selffunded will be transferred to a named beneficiary
                  without probate. These include traditional IRAs (Individual
                  Retirement Accounts), Roth IRAs, SEPIRAs (IRAs for the self
                  employed) and Keogh plans. In addition, many employers now
                  offer what are called 401(k) or 403(b) plans. The 401(k) plans
                  are for businesses, 403(b) plans for employees of nonprofit
                  corporations or educational institutions. Pensions, on the
                  other hand, are set up by your employer, who determines what
                  benefits you receive. Unless your spouse signs a form that
                  waives their “joint and survivor” rights to your pension,
                  they will be entitled to a portion of your benefits after you
                  die. Very few pension plans extend benefits to anyone beyond
                  your surviving spouse.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Naming an Executor or Personal
                  Representative</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A personal representative, sometimes
                  called an executor, handles the business affairs of your
                  estate after your death. This could be a friend, a family
                  member, a corporate entity or bank. A personal representative
                  locates the will if there is one; publishes notices in
                  newspapers to inform potential heirs and creditors about the
                  probate hearing; files an inventory and appraisal of the
                  property; manages the property during the probate process;
                  pays any creditors, taxes, and fees; distributes the assets to
                  the correct people; and prepares a final accounting. When you
                  write a will, you may nominate a personal representative.
                  Before committing your wishes to paper, discuss the nomination
                  with the individual to see if they are willing and able to
                  perform these duties. You should also name a successor
                  executor in case, for any reason, your first choice can’t
                  serve. If you plan to prepare a living trust, it’s generally
                  best that your executor be the same person you chose to be the
                  successor trustee of your trust to avoid problems coordinating
                  trust management tasks and possible conflicts.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Death and Taxes</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Each time property transfers to a new
                  owner there is a potential tax. When property is sold there
                  may be an income tax on the gain from the sale. When property
                  passes to a new owner because of the death of the former
                  owner, state and federal estate taxes may be assessed. When
                  property is transferred by gift, there may be a federal gift
                  tax. Whenever you are planning to transfer property — by
                  sale, gift, or planning a transfer that will take place at the
                  time of your death — get legal and financial advice before
                  you make the transfer.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">State Inheritance Taxes</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Utah imposes a state inheritance tax on
                  property owned by a person at death. Although it is separate
                  from the federal inheritance tax it does not require the
                  payment of additional taxes. If the value of the estate is
                  less than the federal unified credit, no state inheritance tax
                  is due. Furthermore, federal inheritance tax law allows for a
                  credit for state inheritance taxes paid, up to a certain
                  amount. The amount of state inheritance tax due under Utah law
                  is equivalent to the maximum credit allowed under federal law.
                  The net result is that the heirs pay part of the tax to the
                  federal government and part to the state government but the
                  total tax paid is not increased.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Federal Estate Tax</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Federal tax law gives each of us a
                  “Unified Gift and Estate Tax Credit.” This credit allows a
                  certain amount of property to be exempt from Federal gift
                  estate taxes. In 2002 and 2003, the exemption amount is $1
                  million, gradually increasing to $1.5 million in 2004-2005 and
                  $2 million in 2006. At the same time, the top estate tax rate,
                  which was 50% in 2002, will gradually decline to 45% by 2007.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">At death your gross estate includes
                  everything that you own at your death. If the potential value
                  of your estate at death, or if you are married, the potential
                  value of you and your spouse’s combined estates, is close to
                  or exceeds the exemption amount, estate planning is a concern.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Gift Tax</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you make substantial gifts of
                  property and money to family members and friends during your
                  life you may have to pay a federal gift tax. Under present tax
                  law, each year you can give an individual gifts valued at no
                  more than $11,000 free of Federal gift tax (gift taxes are
                  paid by the giver). You can make gifts to as many individuals
                  as you want. For example, if you had four children you could
                  give each of them $11,000 and there would be no federal gift
                  tax. Both members of a couple have separate $11,000
                  exemptions, so they can give a combined total of $22,000 per
                  person per year tax free. You could do this every year, and as
                  long as no individual received more than $11,000 there would
                  be no federal gift tax. Married persons can make gifts of any
                  amount to each other without incurring a gift tax.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Passing Heirlooms to the Next
                  Generation</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you have family heirlooms that you
                  would like to see remain in the family, you need to make
                  decisions about them. There are two ways to pass items to
                  family members: give them away during your lifetime or arrange
                  for them to pass at your death to the individuals you choose.
                  Talk with family members and find out what they would or would
                  not want. The twelve place settings of handcut crystal may not
                  fit into your child’s cupboards or lifestyle. On the other
                  hand, you may discover some items you never realized had very
                  special memories for a particular family member. If you give
                  items away during your lifetime you experience the joy of the
                  person receiving the item. On the other hand, you have to
                  relinquish all of your rights in the item. You can’t give
                  something away and continue using it.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The most common way to make gifts of
                  family heirlooms is to arrange for them to be transferred to
                  your trust or mentioned in your will. You don’t need to
                  include an itemization of your personal property and who you
                  wish to have it in your will; you can write a letter of intent
                  that specifically identifies certain items and the persons you
                  want to receive those items. (For example, &quot;To my
                  daughter Alice, I leave grandma’s garnet pendant.&quot;)
                  Attach a copy of this separate listing to your copy of your
                  will and give one to your attorney. To be sure your wishes are
                  carried out, the will must refer to a &quot;personal property
                  letter.&quot; If there is no will or no reference to a
                  separate listing in the will, the personal property letter is
                  not binding. This letter needs to be signed and dated each
                  time a change is made.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial">Though it may be difficult to think of a
                  time when we will need help in managing our affairs or taking
                  care of ourselves, a thorough estate plan should take this
                  possibility into account. You can plan ahead by preparing a
                  few simple legal documents to ensure that your medical and
                  financial wishes are carried out if you are unable to speak
                  and act for yourself. These legal documents are a health care

                  any competent person who is at least 18 years old and not
                  providing paid health care to you. The person you appoint is
                  called your health care agent. You can give your health care

                  withdraw your health care power of attorney at any time. Give
                  a copy of your health care power of attorney to your appointed
                  health care agent and to your physician. Also, carry a card in
                  your wallet or purse identifying who has your health care
                  power of attorney as well as where your living will is
                  located.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">A Living Will</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A living will is a written statement of
                  your wishes concerning the use of extraordinary medical
                  treatment or artificial nutrition and fluids to keep you alive
                  if there is no reasonable hope of recovery from a terminal
                  illness or accident. A living will gives medical personnel
                  permission to withhold or withdraw life support systems that
                  will merely delay death.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Your decision to write a living will and
                  a health care power of attorney depends on your moral and
                  ethical belief system. If your belief system guides you to
                  choose life at any cost, a living will can also make these
                  feelings known to your family members and physicians. If you
                  do not have a living will, your family is left with the
                  decision and they may not be able to agree on what action to
                  take. A living will removes the decision from your family’s
                  shoulders and makes the decision yours.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Keep your living will in a place where
                  you and your family members can find it easily. Some lawyers
                  suggest that you sign several copies and have each one
                  witnessed and certified (this makes revoking your living will
                  a little more complicated as you have to destroy each of the
                  originals). Carry a card in your wallet stating that you have
                  a living will, where the original is located and who to
                  contact to get the original. If you put the original in your
                  safe deposit box, make sure someone knows where it is and has
                  access to it. Otherwise, your living will may be found too
                  late.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It is your responsibility to inform your
                  physician that you have signed a living will; it is your
                  physician’s responsibility to make your living will a part
                  of your medical record. However, patients admitted for
                  emergency care often don’t have complete medical records
                  with them. For that reason, you can buy a bracelet engraved
                  LIVING WILL/DO NOT RESUSCITATE.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Don’t Let It Rust</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Once you draft a will or trust, you may
                  need to change it. A change in marital status, a move to a new
                  state, the birth of a child, or a change in tax laws can all
                  prompt a review and rewrite of your estate planning documents.
                  Be sure to sign any new will or trust and have it witnessed
                  before destroying the old one. Improper changes may not be
                  effective and may inadvertently invalidate other parts of your
                  plan. So take the time to do it right.</font></p>
