                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">A general cleaning solution can be
                      easily made with home products. Mix 1/2 cup of ammonia,
                      1/3 cup vinegar, 2 tablespoons baking soda and 1 gallon of
                      water.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Another general cleaning solution
                      that can also be easily made with home products consists
                      of a mixture of 2 tablespoons of ammonia, 2 tablespoons of
                      liquid detergent and 1 quart water.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Use a solution of water and vinegar
                      to wash windows. If cleaning outside windows consider
                      using ammonia. A squeegee or newspaper works well to wipe
                      off the solution.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">To freshen any room, closet, or small
                      space (even the refrigerator) soak a cotton ball in
                      vanilla and place in a cup. For the refrigerator consider
                      adding a teaspoon of vanilla to your wash water.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">To clean cutting boards and butcher
                      blocks that smell of onion or garlic sprinkle the board
                      with baking soda, rub in with a wet cloth, then rinse
                      well.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">When washing glass light fixtures
                      place a towel in the sink or bath tub to prevent the
                      fixture from breaking as easily if you should drop it.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Tile can be washed with a paste of
                      baking soda and bleach. Use a small brush to scrub the
                      area. One gallon of hot water with 1/2 cup of ammonia will
                      also do the job.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Glass shower doors can be cleaned
                      with a wet sponge or rag and white vinegar to remove soap
                      and water marks.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Shower curtains can be put in the
                      washing machine with 1/2 cup of bleach to remove mildew
                      and soap scum. Hang dry. For lighter cleaning or spot
                      cleaning use baking soda to remove mildew.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">For sticking runners on windows or
                      drawers rub the tracks with a bar of soap, candle, or
                      paraffin wax.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">To lightly clean blinds rub each side
                      of the blinds with a wet cloth. For heavier soil fill the
                      bathtub with hot soapy water. Place blinds in the tub and
                      use a cloth or soft scrub brush to clean both sides of the
                      blinds. Drain the tub and refill to rinse. If soil was
                      heavy you may need to rinse the blinds more than once.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">For pans with badly burned-on food
                      place a rag saturated with ammonia on the burned surface,
                      put the pan in an airtight plastic bag. Let sit overnight
                      then wash in water and dishwashing liquid.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Clean no-wax floors with a solution
                      of 1 tablespoon white vinegar to 1 gallon of water.</font></li>
