				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">If your income has dropped suddenly,
                  chances are you and your family are experiencing a high degree
                  of anxiety, worrying about where you will find the money to
                  pay necessary bills and obligations. In most cases,
                  uncertainty and avoidance increase the stress associated with
                  income loss. The first step to regaining control is to know
                  where you are financially so you can adjust your spending to
                  fit your present situation. Once you know the figures and can
                  see them in black and white, you can develop a plan to make
                  the most of the resources you have.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Good financial management begins with
                  taking stock, in this case, determining your family’s
                  current financial position, or net worth. A net worth
                  statement is a calculation of your assets (what you own) minus
                  your liabilities (what you owe). Preparing a net worth
                  statement will help you get a clearer understanding of your
                  financial resources. Then you can make decisions about how
                  best to manage them. Another reason for putting together a net
                  worth statement is that lending institutions usually require
                  them before issuing or renegotiating a loan, so take the time
                  to do this before you talk to your bankers or creditors.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Assembling Asset Values</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some assets are held as cash–the
                  balances in checking, savings and money market accounts–or
                  can be easily converted to cash, like Certificates of Deposit.
                  Keep in mind that cashing in CDs before they mature may result
                  in an interest penalty. Some assets can be cashed in or sold
                  at their current market value–stocks, bonds, mutual funds
                  and other market securities.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some assets cannot be sold, or are more
                  difficult to turn into cash. Withdrawing money from your
                  retirement plan, pension or Individual Retirement Account
                  (IRA) before age 59½ will mean at least a 10% tax penalty,
                  plus other charges.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Assets such as real estate and personal
                  property can be sold, but usually not as quickly as stocks and
                  bonds. Assets such as cars, furniture and appliances usually
                  depreciate in value; so they are worth less now than when you
                  bought them, even if they are still in good condition.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To calculate your assets, write down the
                  current amount of cash in your savings, checking and money
                  market accounts. Use the most recent statements to find
                  account balances and current CD values. If you have government
                  savings bonds, call a bank to find out the current value. If
                  you have Internet access, you can go to <a href="http://www.savingsbonds.gov/">www.savingsbonds.gov</a>
                  and use their calculator to find out what your bonds are
                  worth.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The cash surrender value of your whole
                  life insurance policies is available by checking your policy
                  or calling your agent. If you own stocks, bonds, or mutual
                  funds, check a newspaper that publishes the stock market
                  information daily. They are available in most public
                  libraries. Use the current value of your house or other real
                  estate–not what you paid for it. Check the value on your
                  most recent property tax statement or call your local tax
                  assessment official. Check a used vehicle guide (Blue Book)
                  through your local library or insurance agent for the value of
                  your cars and trucks. Or you can check the price of used
                  vehicles at <a href="http://www.edmunds.com">www.edmunds.com</a>
                  or <a href="http://www.carprice.com">www.carprice.com</a>.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To find the value of a boat, camper,
                  snowmobile or other recreational vehicle, talk to a dealer who
                  sells used recreational vehicles. Read the classified ads in
                  the newspapers. Make a conservative estimate of the value of
                  your household items and personal property and collectibles,
                  recording what you could get if you sold everything today.
                  List the current values of your pensions, IRAs or other
                  retirement plans, using the amount you would get if you were
                  able to cash them in today. Don’t forget to add in money
                  others may owe you if you realistically expect to collect it.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Calculating Liabilities</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">After you have totaled all your
                  family’s assets, it is time to calculate your
                  liabilities–the money that you owe others. Start by making a
                  listing of all debts–the balance on your home mortgage, car
                  loan, and other personal loans. The balance of the mortgage
                  loan may be on your monthly statement. If not, ask the lender
                  for the outstanding amount. Record the balances due on all
                  credit cards, charge accounts, installment loans, loans
                  against insurance policies, taxes owed, notes payable and
                  other loans. Be sure to list the total balance due, not just
                  the amount of the monthly payment. List any current unpaid
                  bills, including what you owe the dentist, this month’s
                  utilities, telephone charges, and so forth.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">After you have totaled both your assets
                  and your liabilities, you are ready to subtract total
                  liabilities from total assets. What’s left is your net
                  worth. This is a picture of the financial assets that would
                  remain if you disposed of all your current financial
                  obligations today.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Questions to Ask Yourself</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">After you’ve had a chance to look at
                  what you have written down, here are some questions you might
                  ask yourself:</font></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Where are most of your assets? Are
                      they mostly in one item, such as your house or vehicle?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">How much of your assets can be easily
                      turned into cash?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">How much do you have in bank accounts
                      that can be used during your current financial emergency?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">How long will your savings last if
                      you use them to pay current living expenses? Hopefully,
                      you have put aside three to six month’s take-home pay in
                      an &quot;emergency fund&quot; account.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">How long will you be able to meet
                      your current monthly bills on your reduced income?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">How much equity do you have in your
                      house? To calculate this, take your home’s current
                      market value and subtract the balance left on your
                      mortgage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you have any vehicles or other
                      personal property that could be sold?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you have cash value life insurance
                      against which you could borrow?</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Liquidating Your Assets</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Using your savings is one way to
                  supplement your income. Be cautious, however, about using
                  savings for things that aren’t a high priority. Otherwise,
                  you won’t have anything for short-term emergencies such as
                  unanticipated car and home repairs or unexpected medical
                  bills. Setting spending priorities and decreasing expenses are
                  essential steps in making the most of your assets.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Another source of funds to help carry
                  you through a financial crisis is selling property that you
                  may no longer need, could do without, or can’t afford to
                  keep. Survey your house, basement, garage and attic for items
                  that could be sold. Before determining a selling price, do
                  some research to find out what your items are worth. Visit
                  resale shops, garage sales, and Internet auction sites to find
                  out the going price for similar items.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You can’t sell anything without
                  finding someone willing to buy it. Think about ways you can
                  inform prospective buyers of what you want to sell. Community
                  bulletin boards in supermarkets, shopping malls and
                  laundromats are very popular for posting &quot;For Sale&quot;
                  notices. Cards with small tear-off tabs listing your phone
                  number and the item for sale makes it easier for buyers to
                  call you. Other inexpensive ways to advertise your sale items
                  are radio call-in shows that allow for sale items and
                  classified ads in newspapers or local shopper publications.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Nonfinancial Resources</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">After you have surveyed your financial
                  resources, make a list of your family’s nonfinancial
                  resources that can be used to cut costs, traded for needed
                  goods and services, or used to produce income. Assets such as
                  education, experience, skills and knowledge are hard to put a
                  dollar value on, but don’t overlook them as a resource to
                  help meet expenses. Talk to family members about ways to use
                  their assets to help during this period of reduced income and
                  in the future.</font></p>
