                  <h3><font face="Arial">Lower Interest Rates</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">High interest rates are common on many
                  credit cards. You can end up paying two and three times the
                  original amount in interest on a purchase. If you have a high
                  interest rate on your credit card, try getting it lowered.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Many credit cards have high interest
                  rates, and some interest rates continue to climb the further
                  behind you fall in making payments. If you are behind on your
                  payments for any reason, a lower interest rate may help you
                  catch up. Call the company and tell them of your hardship.
                  Request that the interest rate be lowered. Tell them you are
                  considering transferring your balance, or getting a personal
                  loan from your bank to pay off the credit card and you will be
                  closing your account with them if they cannot accommodate you.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you have been a good customer and pay
                  your bills on time, call the credit card company and explain
                  to them that you have been a good customer, you enjoy having
                  their card, but you have received better offers from other
                  credit card companies. You would like them to lower your
                  interest rate or you plan on switching cards. Your credit card
                  company wants your business; they may lower your rate to keep
                  you as a customer.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If this does not work, you are in no way
                  obligated to switch cards, transfer balances, or look for a
                  personal loan. This is simply something you can try to get a
                  lower interest rate on your credit card. These tactics will
                  not work on all credit card companies, but it is worth a few
                  minutes of your time!</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Explain Hardships</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some creditors are willing to work with
                  you if you have experienced a hardship and will be unable to
                  make your payments in full each month. These hardships can be
                  losing your job, injury, or any other crisis. If your creditor
                  is local, for example your bank, make an appointment with the
                  person who gave you the loan; they may be able to work with
                  you.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your creditor is a credit card
                  company, call them and explain the hardship, inquire if there
                  is anything they can do to assist you so that you can make
                  your payments. Some possibilities would be lowering the
                  interest rate, lowering the minimum monthly payment, or
                  dropping late fees to allow more of your payment to be
                  designated to the balance. If they are willing to work with
                  you, request some form of proof from the company of the
                  assistance they will offer and follow up the phone
                  conversation with a letter to the company stating who you
                  spoke with, the conclusion you came to, and that you expect
                  them to follow through.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In extreme cases where it is not
                  possible for a family to make their mortgage payments, they
                  should contact their loan servicer and seek help with a HUD
                  approved counseling agency. For more information go to <a href="http://www.hud.gov">www.hud.gov</a>
                  or call 1-800- 569-4287 to find the HUD approved counseling
                  agency nearest you.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Other Options for Managing Debt</font></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Work an extra job
                      temporarily.</strong> All income from a second employer
                      should be designated to the debt.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Make double or triple
                      payments.</strong> This can be very effective on reducing
                      debts with high interest rates or late fees. Call the
                      company and inquire if extra payments, will be applied to
                      the principle. Some companies will apply extra payments to
                      the interest owed, or to the finance charges. Some
                      companies will not apply extra payments to the principle
                      unless the late fees are paid in full. In this case it may
                      be wise to save the extra payments until they equal the
                      late fees or the remainder of the balance, then you can
                      pay the bill in full.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Use any assets to lower the
                      balance.</strong> It may be time to take inventory of your
                      house. Is there anything that you are not using that could
                      be sold? There may even be enough to have a garage sale.
                      Get the whole family to participate. Take advantage of
                      bonuses at work, or tax returns, use these forms of extra
                      income to pay down your debt.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Involve your family in making
                      a plan to spend less.</strong> What areas could be cut
                      back? Add up how much you are spending for entertainment
                      or eating out. Is it possible to cut this in half, or find
                      a cheaper way of doing the activity? If you rent three
                      movies every weekend at $3 a movie, this is $9 dollars a
                      week, $36 a month and $432 a year.</font></li>
                    <li><strong><font face="Arial">Any Combination of the above
                      items.</font></strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to
                  borrow against a retirement account such as a 401(k). There is
                  a penalty for borrowing money from such accounts. You may
                  decide it is not worth that cost. Your employer can give you
                  specific information concerning your 401(k) plan. There are
                  some employers who will allow you to borrow against your
                  401(k), but require that you repay the account directly from
                  your paycheck. This money may accumulate a minimal amount of
                  interest in your behalf.</font></p>
