                  <font face="Arial">A sharp drop in income or loss of a job can
                  be a stressful experience for individuals and their families.
                  Yet many community support services exist to assist those
                  currently coping with unemployment or loss of income. This
                  fact sheet presents an overview of major resources available
                  in the state and in the community that people can access when
                  they find themselves out of a job or, for some other reason,
                  in economic difficulty.</font>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Unemployment Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">While you were employed, your employer
                  was probably contributing to the unemployment insurance
                  program on your behalf. Unemployment insurance pays a weekly
                  benefit to all eligible unemployed workers. If there is a
                  chance you are eligible for unemployment insurance, call your
                  state&quot;s Unemployment Insurance Claims Center. When
                  calling to file a new claim, have your Social Security number
                  handy, also your driver’s license number or state ID number
                  if you have one, your alien registration number if you are not
                  a U.S. citizen, and the names and addresses of all employers
                  that you worked for in the last 18 months. When you file a new
                  claim, you will select a personal identification number (PIN).
                  After you have entered this information into the system, your
                  call will be forwarded to a Claims Center representative who
                  will complete your application for benefits. If you have
                  Internet access, you may also file online. It takes about 30
                  minutes to fill out the form if you have assembled all your
                  information, so allow yourself enough time to complete the
                  process.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Expect to wait about three weeks before
                  receiving your first check. Payments are calculated from the
                  first day you file, so filing promptly is to your advantage.
                  However, there is a waiting period of one week for first-time
                  claims. To receive unemployment insurance benefits you must be
                  actively looking for work, and call (or check in online) once
                  a week to report on your work search.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Your weekly payment depends upon the
                  highest wages you earned in any one quarter in your base
                  period. A base period is the first four of the last five
                  completed calendar quarters preceding the quarter in which you
                  file your claim (for example, if you filed in December of
                  2001, your base period would be from July 1, 2000 to June 30,
                  2001). You may receive benefits for a minimum of 10 weeks and
                  a maximum of 26 weeks.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Workforce Services</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you’ve lost a job or are seeking a
                  job, you can receive valuable assistance through Workforce
                  Services.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The Employment Centers provide
                  up-to-date job information through computerized job listings,
                  which are updated daily, and civil service bulletins that list
                  job vacancies. Employment Centers have trained counselors who
                  try to match jobs to persons needing work. In addition to job
                  listings and career counseling services, Employment Centers
                  provide occupational aptitude testing and advice to job
                  seekers on how to write a resume and conduct a job interview.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Food Assistance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Emergency food supplies may be available
                  at local food pantries. Some churches, charitable
                  organizations and community agencies provide free or low-cost
                  meals. There are many contacts in the emergency food
                  assistance network in Utah. See the last few pages of this
                  publication for contact information.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Your children may be eligible for
                  reduced price or free school lunches. Some schools also
                  provide free breakfasts. Contact a school counselor for
                  information on applying. If you have children under age five,
                  you may be eligible for the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)
                  program. WIC is a federally funded, supplemental nutrition
                  program for low-income women who are pregnant, breastfeeding,
                  who have recently had a baby or who are caring for children
                  under age. WIC services are free of charge. Call 877-WIC-KIDS
                  for information on where to find the WIC program in your area.
                  Take proof of income of all household members for the last 30
                  days, a piece of mail with your current address, and some form
                  of identification.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">United States Department of Agriculture
                  (USDA) surplus food may also be available if your income falls
                  within their eligibility guidelines. In Utah, the program is
                  known as the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Under
                  TEFAP, commodity foods such as rice, dairy products, and
                  peanut butter are made available to households for preparing
                  their own meals or to organizations that prepare and provide
                  meals for needy people.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Food stamps are available without charge
                  to qualifying participants and can be used like money to
                  purchase most kinds of food at authorized stores. Some
                  exclusions exist: food stamps cannot be used to buy tobacco,
                  alcoholic beverages or already-prepared foods. Eligible
                  families receive a food stamp allotment based on a combination
                  of factors including family size and monthly income after
                  certain deductions. Allotments decrease with increased family
                  income and assets and increase with the number of family
                  members. You apply for food stamps at any of the Department of
                  Workforce Service centers, if you have Internet access, you
                  can print and fill out the application form and take it into
                  the Workforce Service office. You will need to provide records
                  showing 1) your identity and current address, 2) Social
                  Security card and pay stub for the previous month, 3) expenses
                  for rent or mortgage payments, and 4) expenses for utilities,
                  for property taxes and dependent care. Certain individuals may
                  qualify for expedited food stamps, meaning that they may
                  receive food stamps within seven days of the date the
                  Department of Workforce Services receives the food stamp
                  application.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You don’t have to be unemployed to
                  qualify for food stamps. If you work for low wages, or work
                  part-time, if you receive TANF or other assistance payments,
                  if you are elderly or disabled, or if you live on a small
                  income you are eligible. Program provisions are slightly
                  different for the elderly and disabled.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Clothing</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Need clothes for a special job interview
                  or training program? Local thrift shops, consignment stores
                  and garage sales are wonderful sources of low-cost clothing.
                  Are there members of your family close to your size? Recycling
                  clothing may be another option for you.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Temporary Assistance for Needy Families
                  (TANF) replaces the Aid to Families with Dependent Children
                  (AFDC) program. In Utah, TANF is known as the Family
                  Employment Program (FEP) and is administered through the
                  Department of Workforce Services. The Family Employment
                  Program provides cash assistance and employment services to
                  eligible parents with children under the age of 18 in the
                  home. The purpose of FEP is to help families increase their
                  income and become self sufficient through employment, child
                  support, and/or disability payments. Every parent works with a
                  case manager to develop an employment plan. In order to remain
                  eligible to receive financial assistance a parent must follow
                  through and participate in the activities outlined in their
                  employment plan. Child care is provided to all FEP
                  participants who need the service to participate. Medical
                  coverage is also available.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Parents can only receive cash payments
                  for 36 months over their lifetime. Additional months are
                  approved if the parent is certified as medically unable to
                  work. In addition to being willing to participate in the
                  employment program, participants must pass a gross income test
                  based on household size. For more information, contact one of
                  the Workforce Service offices listed above and ask for a
                  Family Employment Program specialist who can advise you.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Health Services</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The Utah Medicaid program provides a
                  broad range of health services to persons who meet their
                  income and asset eligibility requirements. Services include
                  hospital care, both in-and out-patient services, doctor’s
                  services, laboratory and X-ray, some home health care,
                  physician services, rural health clinic services, and family
                  planning services. They may also provide dental care,
                  eyeglasses and vision screening, prescription drugs, hearing
                  aids, artificial limbs, durable medical equipment and various
                  types of therapy. Persons receiving FEP, SSI payments or
                  Social Security disability payments are all eligible for
                  Medicaid. Beginning in 1998, a new health care program for
                  children was available to Utahns. It is administered by the
                  State Department of Health and is called CHIPS (Children’s
                  Health Insurance Program Services). It is designed to provide
                  benefits to low-income children not covered by private
                  insurance and allows expansion of health insurance to
                  uninsured children. To be eligible for CHIPS, the family’s
                  gross monthly income must be equal to or less than 200% of the
                  federal poverty level. Maximum countable income is based on
                  family size. For more information on CHIP and Medicaid,
                  contact the state Department of Health.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Energy Assistance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The Home Energy Assistance Target (HEAT)
                  program is Utah’s name for the federally funded Low Income
                  Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). HEAT provides home
                  winter utility assistance to low-income households. The
                  program is administered in partnership with the Association of
                  Governments (AOGs) and nonprofit agencies located throughout
                  Utah. The program provides emergency winter utility assistance
                  and some home weatherization. All households served are at or
                  below 125% of poverty.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Financial Counseling Services</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some churches, volunteer groups,
                  universities, colleges, banks, savings and loans, and credit
                  unions offer individual counseling, financial advice and
                  educational programs to persons having financial difficulties.
                  In some cities, non-profit credit counseling centers have been
                  set up by private industry.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Before using a credit counseling
                  service, find out 1) who sponsors the program, 2) what the
                  charges will be, and 3) how the program operates. Do not
                  confuse nonprofit counseling services with agencies that debt
                  pool or consolidate debts. These agencies frequently charge
                  high fees to pay bills without providing financial advice. Be
                  sure you know who is providing advice.</font></p>
