                  <h3><font face="Arial">Some Facts About Debt Brought into
                  Marriage</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Money is one of the topics couples fight
                  about most often. It is also a contributing factor in divorce.
                  Debt brought into marriage is an especially troublesome part
                  of many couples’ money problems. Research shows that debt
                  brought into marriage is the number one problem for newlyweds
                  (Center for Marriage and Family, 2000; Schramm &amp; Lee,
                  2003). In fact, 67% of women and 74% of men enter marriage
                  with at least some debt (Schramm &amp; Lee, 2003). With the
                  exception of home loans, debt comes primarily from auto loans,
                  credit cards, student loans, and medical bills (Schramm &amp;
                  Lee, 2003). Unfortunately, debt never rests, sleeps, gets
                  sick, or goes on vacation and as long as you have debt you
                  will be in financial bondage. Marrying into debt is a big
                  responsibility to take on and in many cases is so unappealing
                  that the debt serves as an anti-dowry. On the other hand,
                  nothing is more appealing or liberating than being debt free.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How Debt Affects the Marriage
                  Relationship</font></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">It is estimated that many American
                      adults spend up to 80 percent of their waking hours either
                      earning, spending, or thinking about money (Olson, 2003).
                      That’s more time than we spend focused on any other
                      topic, including sex.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Debt brought into marriage causes
                      strain on the marriage relationship because it forces us
                      to focus most of our time and energy on money.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">There is evidence that couples’
                      financial problems (including debt) are linked to
                      increased levels of stress, conflict, and marital duress
                      as well as decreased levels of marital satisfaction
                      (Sanchez &amp; Gager, 2000). Financial problems are
                      frequently cited as a major reason for divorce (Sanchez
                      &amp; Gager, 2000).</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">In a study of 21,501 couples, Olson
                      (2003) found that 66 percent indicated that problems
                      associated with major debt was one of the top five
                      financial stumbling blocks in marriage. In contrast, he
                      found that one of the unique strengths of the majority of
                      happy couples was that they did not have major debt
                      problems.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Carlson (2002) found that
                      indebtedness had been a factor in many college
                      graduates’ decisions to delay marriage and/or
                      childbearing because starting a marriage with large
                      amounts of debt places a great strain on the relationship
                      and may put the marriage in jeopardy from the beginning.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Develop a Debt Elimination Plan</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Debt can be addressed prior to getting
                  married or after you get married, but either way it must be
                  addressed. But remember that the less debt you have going into
                  marriage, the greater your chances for success and happiness
                  in marriage (Schramm &amp; Lee, 2003). So consider paying off
                  your debt before tying the knot. Here’s how one person did
                  it.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Doing It by Yourself</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Jack’s Story</strong> - Upon
                  graduating from college, Jack was $15,000 in debt. He was also
                  recently engaged to be married. Jack’s debt was a
                  combination of student loans, a car loan, and some credit card
                  debt. Jack was fortunate enough to get a permanent job offer
                  from the local accounting firm where he had worked as an
                  intern while he was in school. Rather than getting an
                  apartment of his own, a new car, or some other “well
                  deserved” luxury item for himself as a reward for graduating
                  and finding full-time employment, Jack stayed put. Jack
                  continued to live in the same apartment he had been sharing
                  with three roommates. The rent was reasonable and they were
                  able to share utility costs. Jack also decided to prepare most
                  of his own meals, including brown bag lunches, instead of
                  eating out. By maintaining his modest style of living, Jack
                  was able to quickly pay off his credit card debt. He paid it
                  first since it had the highest interest rate. He then applied
                  those payments to his car loan, and once the car was paid off
                  he put all of his extra money toward paying his student loans.
                  One year after graduating Jack was married and he began his
                  marriage debt free.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Doing It as a Couple</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Determine what each spouse owes –
                  preferably prior to getting married (Worksheet 1). No bank or
                  car dealer would think of lending you money and entering into
                  a financial contract with you without first checking your
                  credit history. They do that because they want to see if you
                  are worth the risk. They don’t want to get burned. If you
                  are seriously considering marriage you owe it to yourself and
                  your spouse to share your financial status. Share banking,
                  checking, and credit card statements as well as a knowledge of
                  all your debt (use Worksheet 1: Who Owes What? to help you do
                  this). It’s also a good idea to share your credit reports
                  with one another. You can order your personal credit report
                  from one of the major credit reporting agencies: Equifax at
                  (800) 685-1111, TransUnion at (800) 888-4213, or Experian at
                  (888) 397-3742). Develop a plan to begin reducing debt now
                  that will continue into marriage.</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Communicate – This is the most
                      important thing you can do to minimize financial fights.
                      Sit down together and share your financial information
                      with one another, including what you make, what you’ve
                      saved, what you own, and what you owe.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Don’t keep secrets – It’s a bad
                      idea to hide your debts. Share your debts, family
                      financial upbringing, and current views on money with your
                      fiancé or spouse.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Establish common goals – If you are
                      both in agreement you will be more willing to work
                      together to meet those goals. Start by answering the
                      following questions. What do both of you want to do with
                      your money? How will you get out of debt?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Quantify your goals – Goals that
                      aren’t written and formalized are little more than
                      wishes that often go unfulfilled. Plot out exactly how and
                      when you will pay off your debt. Use one of the suggested
                      books or Web resources to help with this.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Develop a budget – Keep a money
                      diary to get you started. Keep track of everything you
                      spend. Then you will know where your money goes. You
                      can’t stay within your budget if you don’t know where
                      your money goes.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Use savings to pay off high interest
                      loans – Having some emergency savings is wise, but if
                      you’re paying more interest than you are earning,
                      consider paying off your loans with savings.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Switch to a credit card with a lower
                      interest rate – Many low interest credit cards exist.
                      Shop around and choose one that gives you a consistently
                      low rate. Don’t pay more than you have to.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Consolidate your debt – Find one
                      low interest loan where you can combine all your debt and
                      have only one payment. This will reduce your monthly
                      payment and help you pay the debt off more quickly.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Pay more than the minimum due – Do
                      this on credit cards, mortgages, or wherever you can. You
                      will end up paying much less for things in the long run
                      and you will pay them off more quickly.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Cut spending - Spend less and put the
                      money you save toward paying off debt. Do this by
                      budgeting, kicking an expensive habit, and leaving credit
                      cards at home (or getting rid of them).</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Be a financial housekeeper – One of
                      you should take the lead in managing your finances to make
                      sure bills get paid on time and checkbooks get balanced.
                      However, both of you should be aware of and take
                      responsibility for your financial situation.</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Owes What?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">With your partner, fiancé, or spouse
                  fill in a table like the one below. Fill in the amount each of
                  you owe or will owe in each of the following categories.
                  Include amounts you will have to pay once you finish school or
                  the deferred payment period ends. Add your two subtotals to
                  find what your total debt will be as a couple. Be honest about
                  all your debt. It won’t help your marriage to suddenly
                  remember additional debt after your wedding day.</font></p>
