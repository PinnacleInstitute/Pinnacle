                      of the house for long periods of time, and during the
                      night throughout the winter season, 68 or 69 degrees would
                      be sufficient.</font></li>

                      about the different products to place around your windows
                      and window frames in the winter. Heat can be lost through
                      cracks around the edges of your windows.</font></li>

                      hot seasons, especially if you are gone for the better
                      part of the day. When you come home, the house will not be
                      as hot. Then you can open the windows and let the evening
                      breeze cool the house.</font></li>

                      the water no hotter than necessary to adequately clean and
                      sanitize the load. Rinse clothes in cold/cool water.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Let clothes dry in the dryer only
                      part way. Hang them dry in one part of the house and put

                      trees, shrubs, and bushes that will provide shelter for
                      your home in the winter months and shade for your home in

                      or land line). Are there any features you are not using?
                      Taking off unused features could save you money each
