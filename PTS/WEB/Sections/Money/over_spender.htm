                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you race to get your
                        paycheck to the bank before the checks you have written
                        get there?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Are your credit cards
                        usually at their maximum credit limit?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you use credit instead
                        of cash, even when the purchase is small and you have
                        the money?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Are you often broke by
                        payday?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do friends or family tease
                        you about having &quot;champagne&quot; taste on a
                        &quot;beer&quot; budget?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you shop for
                        recreation?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Is your checking account
                        frequently overdrawn?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">Do you notice mood swings
                        when shopping—down before you go, up while shopping,
                        down again after adding your bill?</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Arial" size="3">When you receive
                        statements from creditors at tax time, are you surprised
                        at how much you’ve paid in interest?</font></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If you answered yes more
                    often than no, you may be a chronic overspender. The first
                    step in getting your finances under control is recognizing
                    the problem. The second step is deciding if now is the time
                    you want to make a change. The third step is to take a
                    realistic look at your financial picture, decide where the
                    trouble spots are, and begin doing something, NOW. Maybe you
                    need to get rid of your credit cards, or limit shopping
                    trips with the person who always encourages you to buy
                    things. Maybe you need a cooling off period before
                    purchasing new tools, or clothes, or computer items. By
                    trying to understand the situations that entice you to
                    overspend and making a plan to handle those situations
                    differently, you can make an important difference in your
                    financial future.</font></p>
