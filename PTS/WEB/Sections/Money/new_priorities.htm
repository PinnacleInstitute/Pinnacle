                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">If you or your family are faced with a
                  reduction or loss of income, you’ll need to develop a plan
                  to help you meet your everyday expenses. It isn’t easy.
                  Sometimes people try to hide financial problems from
                  themselves or other household members at crisis points.
                  However, not facing problems can be very harmful because the
                  worry and stress caused by financial uncertainty and lack of
                  cash may be worse than the financial problem itself. It’s
                  important to look realistically at the situation and actively
                  seek solutions to your problems, despite the discomfort it
                  brings.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Because spending decisions affect
                  everyone who lives in your household, it is important to
                  communicate openly with them about the situation. Let them
                  know everyone needs to change their spending patterns. Involve
                  everyone in deciding spending priorities, even children. If
                  family members understand the tough choices that must be made
                  and have a voice in making the decisions, they will be more
                  willing to follow through on them.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As members of your household talk about
                  what is most important, be sure to listen to what is being
                  said. Supporting each other can help you pull together and get
                  through this rocky patch. &quot;How Others Handle Reduced
                  Income Research&quot; shows that individuals and families
                  respond to reduced income by cutting their spending for
                  non-essential items first.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Vacations, eating out, recreation and
                  home furnishings are eliminated before basic needs such as
                  food, shelter, transportation and medical care. When dollars
                  are scarce, people say they revise their budgets. Most
                  families make a new spending plan that includes strategies for
                  getting bills paid. It may be as simple as marking the due
                  dates of fixed bills on the calendar to be sure they are paid
                  on time and then hanging the calendar in a conspicuous place
                  like the front of the refrigerator. Fewer people report
                  increasing their income or using credit to manage finances.
                  Borrowing or using credit cards to pay bills brings only
                  temporary relief. In studies of financial stress, people who
                  increased their use of credit were more unhappy with their
                  financial situation the more they borrowed. Those who quickly
                  made changes in their spending habits were the most satisfied
                  with how they were managing. Those who didn’t make changes
                  felt more out of control and more dissatisfied.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Making a New Spending Plan</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Creating a spending plan is not
                  difficult. The major requirements are income and spending
                  records, a knowledge of family spending goals and priorities,
                  and a certain amount of patience and discipline to get the
                  plan started and to see it through. Financial counselors point
                  out that the most difficult and time-consuming step in any
                  financial activity is the first one–getting started. Once
                  underway, chances are any required recordkeeping will only
                  take an hour a week or less. It may only require writing
                  flexible expenses for things such as food or transportation on
                  that family calendar. After a month, you will have a feel for
                  cash flow and can discuss how expenses can be changed to
                  adjust to the current income.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Work may be needed. Look back through
                  checkbooks, receipts or charge account records for amounts
                  spent on clothing, long-distance telephone calls,
                  entertainment, personal care items, and expenses that don’t
                  occur very often like property taxes. As you begin cutting
                  back and keeping track of outgoing dollars, put a shoe box,
                  empty restaurant-sized peach can, or a spindle for storing
                  labeled receipts.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As you think about how you are spending
                  and try to plan how much you can now spend, think about these
                  questions:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Which expenses are essential to the
                      family’s well-being?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">How much can you afford to spend in
                      each category?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Are there opportunities to cooperate
                      with others by trading or sharing what we can do or learn
                      to do?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Can we substitute a less costly item?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Can we do without or do it less
                      often?</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When members of your household begin to
                  see how money was and is being spent, it is time for a
                  conference. Lay out the records of anticipated monthly income
                  and expenses for all family members to see and evaluate.
                  Subtract expenses from income. Is the remainder positive or
                  negative after all expenses are subtracted from monthly
                  income?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It’s easier to see the general pattern
                  of spending if expenses are categorized. This reveals the
                  percentage of income spent on food, housing, clothing, medical
                  care, insurance and other items. There can’t be any
                  hard-and-fast rules for household spending because individual
                  needs, tastes and economic circumstances are so important.
                  However, examining spending by each category does highlight
                  differences between stated goals and priorities and actual
                  spending patterns and income.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your household is operating &quot;in
                  the red&quot; month after month, a couple of things must
                  happen–expenses must be reduced, income must rise, or both.
                  Do you have savings that can be used to meet expenses in an
                  emergency? Are there assets you could sell to help out with
                  expenses? What are the possibilities for part-time or
                  temporary work to supplement your income? Are some expenses
                  out of line with stated priorities or expected income? Where
                  can cuts be made so they cause the least sacrifice in
                  household well-being?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If too much of your income is going to
                  fixed expenses such as housing or debt payments, there may not
                  be enough money left to cover your other living expenses. You
                  may need to refinance your loans, move to lower-cost housing,
                  or surrender property to creditors to get out from under your
                  debt.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some big expenses like property taxes
                  and insurance premiums come due only once or twice a year.
                  Others are seasonal, such as school clothes in the fall and
                  holiday gifts in December. Estimate these expenses and include
                  them in your spending plan.</font></p>
