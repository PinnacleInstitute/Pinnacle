				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Bankruptcy is the legal action that you can
                  take to eliminate or reduce the amount of debt you owe to
                  creditors. Bankruptcy is designed to give you a fresh start.
                  However, there can be unpleasant consequences to declaring
                  bankruptcy.</font>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Chapter Options in Bankruptcy</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are two options available to those
                  who have debt responsibilities beyond their control:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Chapter 7 bankruptcy</strong>
                      forgives all unsecured debt. (Unsecured debt is a debt
                      that does not have collateral; for example, your credit
                      cards.) Secured debt is not forgiven. Examples of secured
                      debt would be a car or a home. Your car loan is secured by
                      the car; your mortgage is secured by the home and or
                      property.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Chapter 13 bankruptcy</strong>
                      allows you to repay a portion of your debts over a period
                      of 3-5 years. You are placed on a strict budget. You are
                      allowed money for food, housing, and a few other
                      necessities. All remaining money left each month is
                      requested by the court to pay your creditors. This
                      repayment plan does not allow for new debt to be acquired.
                      If you follow the budget you will receive a discharge of
                      your debts and they will no longer need to be a concern.
                      If you fail to follow the set budget, your bankruptcy
                      cannot be completed and will be dismissed. You will find
                      yourself back where you started and your creditors will
                      once again have free access to try to collect the debt.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In filing for either chapter, any assets
                  you might own will be taken to repay as much of the debt as
                  possible. Some of the debt may be reaffirmed, meaning that you
                  can claim responsibility for that debt and continue payments.
                  Other debts such as child support, alimony, student loans, and
                  most back taxes cannot be forgiven; they are called
                  non-dischargeable debts. Other non-dischargeable debts also
                  include purchases made prior to filing. This may include cash
                  advances of $750 or more made within 70 days of filing and
                  luxury goods purchased within 90 days prior to filing. It is
                  up to each bankruptcy judge to determine what constitutes a
                  &quot;luxury good.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are some assets that can be exempt
                  in a bankruptcy, for example, a certain percentage of the
                  equity in your home. The state in which you reside will
                  determine the amount of any assets you can keep.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Other Chapter Options in Bankruptcy</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Chapter 11</strong>, known as
                  “reorganization” is used by businesses and by individuals
                  whose debts are large.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Chapter 12</strong> was enacted
                  by Congress in 1986 to meet the specific needs of financially
                  distressed farm families, and to eliminate many of the
                  barriers that farmers faced when filing under either a Chapter
                  11 or 13. The primary purpose of a Chapter 12 is to give
                  family farmers facing bankruptcy a chance to reorganize their
                  debts and keep their farms.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection will
                  reduce the capital gains tax burden for farm assets sold as
                  part of the reorganization plan. This will allow farmers to
                  sell grain, livestock, and other farm property to generate
                  cash flow essential to the maintenance of a farm operation,
                  and essential for debt repayment.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
                  Consumer Protection Act of 2005</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and
                  Consumer Protection Act of 2005 was signed into law by
                  President Bush on April 20, 2005. The intent of this bill was
                  to create a more fair playing ground for debtors and
                  creditors. For the debtor, however, this bill made filing more
                  expensive and discharging debts more difficult. Debtors are
                  required to obtain financial counseling prior to filing. Those
                  filing Chapter 13 will be required to receive finance
                  education in addition to the financial counseling. This
                  counseling and education will not be free. In order to file
                  for a Chapter 7 debtors will be required to pass a &quot;means
                  test.&quot; This is a test to see if your income falls below
                  the area median income. If it does, you may qualify for a
                  Chapter 7. If it does not, you will not be able to file a
                  Chapter 7, and will be encouraged to file a Chapter 13. The
                  consequences of filing for bankruptcy will be determined by
                  the debtor’s financial situation and the reasons for filing.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Bankruptcy Fees</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Fees are required to file for
                  bankruptcy. The filing fee is typically $200. The lawyer fee
                  can start at approximately $500. Remember, these are
                  approximations. Under the new Bankruptcy Law of 2005 these
                  fees will increase.</font></p>
                  <font face="Arial">Is filing bankruptcy the right thing to do?</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not everyone who is in a lot of debt
                  needs to declare bankruptcy. It may just be a matter of
                  getting your finances in order. Re-evaluate your debts; will
                  you be able to take care of the debt through hard work and
                  discipline? Refer to the previous section about managing your
                  debt. Consult a trusted financial counselor or consumer credit
                  counseling service to give you honest advice. You can also
                  consult a lawyer. Research a lawyer just as you would a
                  financial counselor. Bankruptcy lawyers are not required to
                  have training in financial management. Some may be out to make
                  money, not to help you make the right decision.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Consequences to Filing for Bankruptcy</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Credit report: Bankruptcy will stay on
                  your credit report for up to 10 years. Every time your credit
                  is checked, the bankruptcy will appear and could hinder your
                  getting another loan, job, or even a place to rent. Bankruptcy
                  labels you as a financial risk to creditors. Creditors,
                  landlords, and employers need to know of your financial
                  responsibility.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Because of the damage done to your
                  credit, you may not be able to get a loan with a reasonable
                  interest rate for quite some time. You may need to use cash
                  for purchases. You can rebuild your credit, but this will take
                  time and discipline. If you do not change your financial
                  habits after declaring bankruptcy, you increase the chance of
                  being in financial distress again. Under the new bankruptcy
                  law there will be contingencies as to when you can refile for
                  a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This is based on past bankruptcy
                  filings and the outcome of those filings. To refile a Chapter
                  7, you will have to wait eight years.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Bankruptcy is Not the Only Choice</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are alternatives to bankruptcy.
                  The first and most basic option is to contact your creditors
                  and work out a debt repayment plan with them directly. Since
                  the creditors want to be repaid, they are, more often than
                  not, willing to cooperate. Methods for debt repayment are
                  discussed on this site. Savings are also important. It may
                  take some time to build up a savings, but this can make a
                  substantial difference when faced with an emergency. Take the
                  time to explore this site and see what your options are for
                  getting out of debt and for building up a savings account.
                  There is power in self sufficiency. It is up to you and your
                  family to make it happen!</font></p>
