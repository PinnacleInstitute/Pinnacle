                about Money</font>
				</p>
                <div class="tabletab">
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Parents who take the time to teach their
                  children about money will be doing their children a great
                  service. As a parent, it is important to look back on your
                  youth and think about how your parents taught, or did not
                  teach, you about money. Then think about what you would like
                  your child to know about money. There are many different ways
                  you can go about teaching your child about money. What they
                  learn from you will most likely follow them the rest of their
                  lives.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Teaching children about money can
                  provide life-long lessons of responsibility. For example, if a
                  child spends all his or her money on soda and candy, he or she
                  might not have enough left over for an afternoon out with
                  friends. This scenario could have two endings. First, the
                  child receives money from you to cover the expense for the
                  outing, or second, he or she talks with their friends about
                  doing something that does not require money. This might sound
                  harsh to not give up a few dollars so your child can have an
                  afternoon out. However, take a look into the future. If your
                  grown-up children, spend all their money on luxury items
                  (cars, trips, music, etc.) they may find themselves short on
                  money for a house payment, tuition, or an insurance premium.
                  The consequences then will be much more severe.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Remember each child is different and may
                  require a different approach to ensure that learning is
                  successful. There are many different ways to help children
                  understand money. This can be done through an allowance,
                  budgeting, and teaching them different aspects about finances
                  such as savings and credit.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Allowances</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are many different ways an
                  allowance can be approached. You may not favor an allowance
                  option; however, consider the following ideas and then
                  formulate something that will work for your family.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">How to Determine the Amount of
                  Allowance:</font></h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">The first step is to decide which
                      expenses you expect your children to manage. If you only
                      expect them to provide for their own entertainment with
                      friends (movies, candy, etc.) then their allowance should
                      reflect that. Take the time to figure what they might
                      typically spend to determine what would be appropriate. If
                      you determine that they should be responsible for
                      clothing, sports, or music lessons then their allowance
                      should be large enough to cover those expenses. Remember,
                      if you expect them to pay for their music lessons it will
                      be important to help them pay that amount first, then they
                      can do whatever they want with the rest. If they spend
                      their money frivolously they might not have enough to pay
                      for their lessons. Take into account the maturity of your
                      child and what skills you would like him or her to gain.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">A second idea would be to give each
                      child a dollar amount based on his or her age. As children
                      age then their allowance will increase (remember to keep
                      in mind which expenses you expect them to manage). Once
                      they reach an age where they can earn their own money
                      (perhaps in a summer job) consider reducing the allowance,
                      or encouraging them to save more of their earnings.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">A third idea would be to have each
                      child be responsible for certain responsibilities around
                      the house. If they complete the tasks then they receive an
                      allowance. This could be thought of in business-like
                      terms, doing the work results in a paycheck.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">For children who do not respond to
                      doing chores for their allowance, set their allowance in a
                      different manner (see suggestions above). However, being a
                      part of a family does require working together for
                      everyone’s good. Children can be expected to assist with
                      household chores, if they do not do their share, consider
                      taking away a privilege.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Some may consider just giving their
                      children money as they need it, encouraging them to be
                      helpful around the house. This might be called a ‘you
                      help me, I’ll help you’ approach. This could lead to
                      children learning that any time they need money, it is
                      just given to them. It is valuable to learn that money
                      comes with a price (working for a paycheck) and will not
                      always be handed to them without strings attached.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">What an Allowance Can Teach:</font></h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Valuable lessons about money
                      management can be learned through budgeting. Children
                      should learn how to save a portion of their allowance, and
                      how to spend appropriately for what they want or need.
                      This can be taught by using envelopes, or jars, for the
                      children to separate their savings from their spending
                      money. Determining a percentage of their allowance to be
                      saved, will eliminate reevaluating how much to save in the
                      event their allowance increases.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You can teach your children about
                      interest by setting up a savings account at your local
                      bank or credit union. This way the children can see their
                      money grow. Then children can create their own financial
                      goals for the future and have a purpose to their savings.
                      Perhaps it will be a percentage of a new bicycle, a dress
                      or suit for a dance, or even a down payment on a car.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Teach them that interest also works
                      in reverse. If things are purchased on credit, an interest
                      rate will be applied. This will be money going away from
                      their account, not growing in their account.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Involve Your Children</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Have your children play an active role
                  in how they are taught about money. Remember, every child is
                  different and may require learning in a slightly different
                  way. Play an active role in their learning process, but allow
                  them to make their own decisions. Experience can be the best
                  teacher. This way your children will learn money management
                  skills when the stakes are low and when they grow up they can
                  successfully manage larger amounts of money.</font></p>
