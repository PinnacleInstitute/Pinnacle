                  <font face="Arial">Making changes is challenging. It’s
                  difficult to adopt new ways of doing familiar tasks. Making
                  financial changes in a family is no different. It requires
                  thoughtful, realistic planning, goals that reflect family
                  priorities, time to refine and evaluate progress, and
                  determination keep working long enough to see results.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As you begin to make financial changes,
                  choose some tools to help make it easier.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Make a list of questions to ask yourself
                  before making purchases:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Will this purchase help me reach my
                      financial goals?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Is this purchase listed on my
                      spending plan? Can I do without this item, at least for
                      now?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">What will I have to give up if I
                      spend my money on this purchase? Do I need this item or do
                      I need this money for one of my financial goals?</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Make your spending plan part of your
                  daily life. If you have a goal to save $50, look for ways you
                  can spend less today. Cut out a snack, bring your lunch from
                  home or pass up magazines at the grocery store. Tell someone
                  else what you are doing and ask for their support. Write your
                  plan down so it is clear in your mind.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Break large tasks or goals into smaller
                  pieces and work on them step by step.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Plan for new situations and changes.
                  Look ahead for increased expenses as a child enters school or
                  the washer needs to be replaced.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Plan large expenses so they occur over
                  several years. New carpet this year, a new refrigerator in two
                  years, a new car in five years.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Keep your spending plan where you can
                  refer to it as you make purchasing decisions. Develop a record
                  keeping system. Allow yourself a special treat for
                  successfully following your plan.</font></p>
