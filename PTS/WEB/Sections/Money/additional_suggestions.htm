                        will need extra money . . . make a chart that includes
                        the age of everyone in the family by year. This will
                        give you an overall view of what year you should expect
                        certain expenses with each child. For example, you may
                        be responsible for helping with college expenses for
                        your 18 year-old and additional car insurance for your
                        16 year-old in the same year.</font></li>

                        and thrift stores! It is very easy to get a good deal at
                        a local thrift store. Be careful not to go overboard
                        with purchases; you may spend more than you intended!</font></li>
