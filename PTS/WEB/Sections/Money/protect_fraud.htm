                Insurance Fraud</font>
				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Insurance is often bought and then set
                  aside until a loss occurs and a claim is made. It is then that
                  some people find their policies do not contain all of the
                  coverage their agents described, or they find they have no
                  coverage at all. Sometimes this is caused by fraud or
                  misrepresentation. Most insurance agents and companies are
                  honest, but there have been abuses as in the following
                  complaints received by city and state regulatory officials.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">&quot;There’s no risk of losing your
                  money,&quot; was the phrase used by an insurance agent we will
                  call Bob. Bob targeted retired senior citizens that had set
                  aside nest eggs of at least $20,000. He first approached them
                  to buy nursing home or Medicare supplement policies. Once sold
                  he persuaded them to place their nest eggs in an investment
                  type contract.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Checks for these policies were made out
                  to Bob’s agency, deposited into his business account, and
                  then withdrawn for his personal use. As a result, insurance
                  companies did not receive the premiums, and clients, instead
                  of policies, received only assurances from Bob that everything
                  was okay.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When the fraud was discovered, only
                  those with documentation were able to recoup their losses. The
                  necessary documentation included a check, a receipt,
                  application, or policy naming the company that Bob was
                  representing, and also the coverage provided and premium paid.
                  As long as an agent is appointed by an insurer and acts within
                  the limits of their contract, the insurer is responsible for
                  the actions of its agent.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As it turned out, many of Bob’s
                  clients found themselves lacking the necessary documentation
                  to recover their losses from the insurer. Ultimately they were
                  left to their own devices to recover their money. Many never
                  did.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">One victim commented that she would have
                  never loaned a friend $30,000; instead she trusted it to a
                  stranger without investigation or receiving any proof of
                  payment in return. A little prevention would have saved these
                  people a great deal of money and worry.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">In one case, many of Don’s clients
                  accepted his personal checks to settle claims of losses. Only
                  when the claim payment was delayed were suspicions raised. One
                  client took his suspicions to the State Insurance Department.
                  Through their investigation it was discovered that a policy
                  had never been obtained by the agent for the client.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">&quot;Don&quot; had acted as an
                  insurance company, both accepting premiums and providing
                  coverage on claims. This was illegal, and he did not have
                  assets to cover the claims. Be sure to get a policy when you
                  pay a premium and be aware of the source of your claim check.
                  Don’t accept a check from an agent or insurance agency to
                  cover a claim. Both the policy and claim check should have the
                  name of the insurance company.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You can protect yourself against such
                  loss by asking questions and being cautious. GET INVOLVED!
                  Take an active part to insure that fraud is not part of your
                  insurance transaction, whether it is coverage for your home,
                  automobile, life, or health.</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>DECIDE WHAT INSURANCE YOU CAN
                      AFFORD.</strong> Insurance is protection against financial
                      catastrophe. Weigh your risks of loss against possible
                      costs, consider what you would be willing and able to
                      assume, then shop for the most protection for your money.
                      Re-evaluate needs as your circumstances change.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>DON’T BUY SOMETHING YOU
                      DON’T NEED.</strong> Don’t buy hastily. Understand
                      what you are buying. You are the best judge of what you
                      need. Be sure that you understand the insurance offered to
                      you and how it will meet your needs. Often people buy more
                      than one policy covering the same type of occurrence. Find
                      out if you are buying duplicate, unnecessary coverage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>SHOP AND COMPARE.</strong>
                      Get more than one quote. Compare costs and benefits. Which
                      will be the best for you? Coverages are available with
                      many different companies at many different prices.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>TAKE YOUR TIME.</strong>
                      Don’t be pressured. When in doubt, make no promises or
                      commitments, no matter how promising the deal looks. It is
                      far better to wait and be sure than to act hastily and be
                      sorry later.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>GET ANOTHER OPINION.</strong>
                      Don’t ask just anyone. Ask someone that understands the
                      type of insurance you are interested in.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>DON’T BE FOOLED BY
                      TECHNIQUES</strong> used by some to give validity to a
                      sale. For example, name dropping, references to the
                      religious standing of the salesperson, etc. Don’t allow
                      these techniques to influence your decision. The merits of
                      the product should stand alone.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>KNOW WHO YOU ARE DEALING
                      WITH.</strong> Is the agent and insurance company licensed
                      to do business in your state? Is the agent authorized to
                      represent that particular company? If in doubt, ask the
                      agent to see his license, or call the Utah State Insurance
                      Department for verification of the licensure of both the
                      agent and company.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>CHECK THE STABILITY OF THE
                      COMPANY.</strong> This can be done in at least two ways.
                      First, review the information about the company in either
                      the &quot;Best’s Insurance Report&quot; or
                      &quot;Standard and Poor’s&quot; report at your local
                      library. Both use a gradation system. Second, review the
                      company’s annual financial report filed with the State
                      Insurance Department.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>DON’T PAY CASH.</strong>
                      When possible, checks should be made payable to the
                      insurance company. If a check must be made out to the
                      agency, be sure to identify somewhere on the check which
                      insurance company is providing coverage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>OBTAIN PROOF OF PURCHASE.</strong>
                      Like any other purchase, you should request a receipt. If
                      possible, in an insurance transaction, you should also
                      obtain a copy of the application and review it. The
                      receipt and application need to identify the name of the
                      insuring company and the effective date of coverage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>GET A COPY OF THE POLICY.</strong>
                      Never, never fail to get a written policy, or in the case
                      of group health insurance, a certificate.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>READ YOUR POLICY,</strong>
                      especially the fine print. Some policies have a free
                      examination period in which you can review the policy and
                      return it without penalty. Be sure that all of the
                      salesperson’s promises, the application and other
                      literature given to you are reflected in the policy. If
                      not, call the company or agent to make the changes
                      necessary before the free examination period ends.
                      Ultimately the buyer is responsible to know what he/she
                      buys. Read the policy. If you don’t understand it, find
                      someone who does, or call the State Insurance Department
                      for help.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>CHECK INTO POLICY DELAYS.</strong>
                      Normally, your policy should be delivered to you within 30
                      days of the date of application. If it is not delivered,
                      contact the agent or company and obtain a written reply of
                      the reason for the delay. If you do not have a policy
                      within 60 days, contact the State Insurance Department.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>REPLACING INSURANCE.</strong>
                      Make certain the coverage you are buying to replace
                      another policy contains similar or better benefits.
                      Don’t allow one to lapse before a new one becomes
                      effective.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>KNOW THE PENALTIES</strong>
                      for withdrawing money from a life insurance policy or an
                      annuity plan, or canceling any type of insurance policy.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>KEEP TRACK OF YOUR
                      INVESTMENT.</strong> If you have purchased an annuity or
                      life insurance policy for investment purposes, monitor it
                      regularly. Be sure to get status reports from the insuring
                      company at least annually.</font></li>
