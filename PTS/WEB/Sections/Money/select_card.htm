				</p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Consumers who want to save interest
                charges on large loans, such as a home mortgage or auto loan,
                usually comparison shop for the best deal. Comparison shopping
                for a credit card is also an excellent practice because terms
                and conditions of the account can make a difference in how much
                consumers pay for the privilege of borrowing. Consumers are
                often amazed at some of the hidden costs of some credit cards.
                With information in this fact sheet, Utahns can compare credit
                card terms they have already accepted with offers received in
                the mail and/or over the telephone. The goal is to assist
                consumers in finding credit cards with terms best suited for
                their spending and repayment habits.</font></p>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Credit Card Terms</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">The Federal Truth-in-Lending Act requires
                credit card issuers to display the costs of credit cards in an
                easy-to-read box format on most applications and solicitations.
                The Schumer Box that lists the costs of the card is named after
                the representative who led the legislation through Congress (see
                Table below). Although the Schumer Box is helpful, complex
                interest computation methods and other factors make it
                challenging for consumers to compare credit card plans. The
                following pages contain factors consumers may want to consider
                when selecting a credit card.</font></p>

                <h3><font face="Arial">Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">The APR is a measure of the cost of credit
                that includes interest and may also include other charges. The
                APR is expressed as a yearly interest rate (e.g., 21.2%, 18.5%,
                6.9%). In the Schumer Box (Table 1), the APR is 19.9%. The lower
                the APR, the better for the credit cardholder. The APR is
                advertised in solicitations and is disclosed to cardholders when
                the account is opened. It can also be found on each monthly
                bill. The APR can be somewhat misleading because it does not
                include the effect of monthly or daily compounding of finance
                charges, additional fees, or factors that eliminate the grace
                period, all of which can raise the actual cost to consumers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The APR can be fixed or variable. A fixed
                rate remains constant until the credit card issuer gives written
                notice of a change. By federal law, issuers must give consumers
                15 days’ notice before changing the interest rate on a credit
                card. A variable interest rate is subject to change, depending
                on the index used by the credit card issuer. Common indexes are
                the prime rate; the one-, three- or six-month Treasury bill
                rate; and the Federal Reserve discount rate. Most of these
                indexes can be found in the money or business section of major
                newspapers. The variable rate is calculated by adding a fixed
                percentage (i.e., 9.9 percent) to the index rate listed for the
                week specified.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Rate changes will raise or lower the
                finance charge amount paid on accounts. If a credit card has a
                variable rate feature, ask the card issuer whether there is a
                minimum and maximum APR and how often and by how much the rate
                can change. When the prime rate is decreasing, the variable rate
                is the best choice, but if it is increasing, the more stable
                fixed rate is generally best. Make a selection based on the risk
                you are willing to take. A consumer who consistently pays the
                total balance owed each month will find the APR not as important
                as other factors.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The periodic rate is the interest rate the
                credit card issuer applies to the outstanding balance to
                calculate the finance charge for each billing period. The
                monthly periodic rate is determined by dividing the yearly APR
                by 12. For example, the monthly periodic rate on an APR of 21.9
                percent is 1.825 percent (.219 ÷ 12 = .01825). Cardholders with
                an outstanding balance on their credit cards can estimate the
                monthly finance charge by multiplying the periodic rate times
                the balance. For example, the estimated finance charge on an
                outstanding balance of $3,000 at 1.825 percent is $54.75 ($3,000
                x .01825 = $54.75). If the consumer makes a payment of $54.75,
                the interest due is paid but no money is left to apply toward
                the principal—this payment only covers the cost of monthly
                interest and the loan would never be paid off! If the consumer
                makes a payment of $60, then $5.25 is applied toward the
                principal. The result is that it will take the consumer over 11
                years to pay off the $3,000 debt that would cost the consumer
                $8,082 ($3,000 + $5,082 interest).</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Some credit card issuers offer tiered
                rates. Tiered rates require that large amounts be charged to
                take advantage of the lower interest rates. For example, the APR
                on charges up to $2,000 may be 18.9 percent while the rate on
                charges of $10,000 and above may be 13.4 percent. Be cautious
                about charging for unnecessary items just to get a lower
                interest rate or being tempted to pay less than you otherwise
                would on the same balance as if it were all at the higher rate.
                A lower rate on a higher balance can cost as much as a higher
                rate on a lower balance—so you are not better off financially.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">If you have a credit card with a high
                interest rate, consider calling the bank to request a lower one.
                If your bank refuses, you have the option of changing to a
                credit card issuer offering a lower interest rate. There are
                several organizations that provide a list of banks that offer
                low interest-rate/no-annual-fee cards (see Web Site Resources).
                A survey by Princeton Survey Research Associates polled people
                who ordered a list of low-interest-rate credit cards and found
                that one-fifth called their banks to ask for a lower rate. Of
                these people, nearly half (43 percent) got a lower rate simply
                by asking.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Consumers will have to decide whether
                having a local or out-of-state credit card issuer is important.
                Some prefer a local issuer because of the customer service
                provided by the financial institution.</font></p>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Grace Period</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">A grace period is the time between the
                date a credit card was used to purchase an item and the date the
                APR (finance charges) will be charged on that purchase. The
                grace period is not the number of days a consumer has after
                receiving the bill to pay for it. Many credit card issuers offer
                a 20 to 25 day grace period while others offer none. The Schumer
                Box in Table 1 shows a 25-day grace period for this credit card
                account.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Many cardholders mistakenly believe that
                if a 25-day grace period is provided, all new purchases will be
                free of finance charges until after that 25-day period. Under
                most plans, the only time a cardholder’s new purchases escape
                all finance charges is when both of the following conditions are
                met:</font></p>
                <ol>
                  <li><font face="Arial">There is no unpaid balance left over
                    from the previous billing cycle. That is, either the entire
                    &quot;new balance&quot; on the last month’s bill was zero,
                    or, if that new balance was greater than zero, the
                    cardholder paid it in full by the due date.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">The new balance of purchases made
                    during the current billing cycle is paid in full by the
                    current due date.</font></li>
                </ol>
                <p><font face="Arial">If the consumer does not pay the entire
                outstanding new balance due on the previous statement, any new
                purchases made in the current month will start accruing interest
                immediately. The consumer forfeits the grace period. If you have
                an outstanding balance on your credit card at the beginning of
                the new billing cycle, you will not benefit at all from the
                grace period. If your goal is to avoid paying finance charges,
                you must pay off your credit card balance in full each month.</font></p>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Finance Charges and Balance Computation
                Method For Purchases</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">If your credit card plan has no
                &quot;free&quot; or grace period, or if you expect to pay for
                purchases over time, it is important to know how the card issuer
                calculates the finance charge. The finance charge, or the dollar
                amount you pay to use credit, will vary depending upon the
                method the card issuer uses to figure the balance. The method
                used can make a difference in the amount of finance charges a
                consumer will pay—even when the APR is identical to that of
                another card issuer and the pattern of purchases and payments is
                the same. For consumers who never carry over a balance (always
                pay the balance in full), the finance charge computation method
                used by the credit card issuer is not as important as other
                factors.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">There are two basic ways card issuers
                calculate balances on which finance charges are computed:</font>
                <ol>
                  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Average Daily Balance</strong>
                    (including new purchases or excluding new purchases). This
                    method gives the cardholder credit for payment from the day
                    the card issuer receives it. To compute the balance due, the
                    card issuer first totals the beginning balance for each day
                    in the billing period. Next, any payments credited to the
                    account are deducted on the day received. New purchases may
                    or may not be added to the balance, depending on the plan,
                    but cash advances typically are added. The daily balances
                    are summed for the billing cycle and the total is then
                    divided by the number of days in the billing period. The
                    result is the &quot;average daily balance.&quot; Note the
                    Schumer Box (Table 1) reveals the most commonly used average
                    daily balance method (including new purchases).</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Two-Cycle Average Daily Balance</strong>
                    (including new purchases or excluding new purchases). This
                    balance is the sum of the average daily balances for two
                    billing cycles. The first balance is for the current billing
                    cycle, and is figured by adding the outstanding balance
                    (excluding or including new purchases and deducting payments
                    and credits) for each day in the billing cycle, and then
                    dividing by the number of days in the cycle. The second
                    balance is for the preceding billing cycle and is figured in
                    the same way as the first balance. The two-cycle average
                    daily balance is used primarily to backcharge interest on a
                    previous balance on which consumers did not pay finance
                    charges (because their balance was zero), but neither did
                    they pay off the current balance due in full. The method
                    affects consumers who always or sometimes carry over a
                    balance.</font></li>
                </ol>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Comparison of Finance Charge</font></h3>
                <h4><font face="Arial">Computation Methods</font></h4>
                <p><font face="Arial">Assume a consumer starts the first month
                with a zero balance and charges $1,000, of which the minimum
                amount due (listed on the statement) is paid. The next month,
                another $1,000 is charged and then the entire balance due is
                paid off. The same pattern is repeated three more times during
                the year. The stated interest rate on all cards is 19.8 percent
                APR. The yearly finance charge varies from $66 to $196.20. (See
                Table 2.)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">If you do not understand how the balance
                on your account is computed, ask the card issuer. An explanation

                statement the card issuer provides to you.</font></p>

                <h3><font face="Arial">Annual Fees</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">Most credit card issuers charge annual
                membership or other participation fees. These fees range from
                $15 to $35 for most cards and from $50 and higher for some
                &quot;premium&quot; or &quot;gold&quot; cards. Some institutions
                still offer “no fee” cards, but these are less common than
                they used to be. Other institutions waive the fee for the first
                12 months, but then bill the cardholder as soon as the second
                year begins. Still other issuers have a use fee (i.e., $1.75)
                for each month the card is used—meaning cardholders will pay
                $21 a year if the card is used monthly. The best deal for most
                consumers is a &quot;no-fee&quot; card. Some credit card issuers
                will reduce or eliminate annual fees if cardholders indicate
                they plan to switch to another company’s &quot;no-fee&quot;
                card. A change can be requested by phone. You also have the
                option of canceling the card within a stated period to avoid the
                annual fee. There may, however, be a cancellation fee.</font></p>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Transaction Fees For Cash Advances</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">Many issuers charge cash advance fees,
                which typically amount to between 2% and 3% of the total cash
                advance. The fee may have a minimum amount, often $2, and a
                maximum amount, such as $10. Note the Schumer Box in Table 1
                reveals the cash advance fee is 2% with a minimum fee of $3. The
                cash advance fee may be assessed for each cash advance taken. A
                consumer who is charged $5 for $20 in cash is paying a
                transaction fee equal to 25% of the amount borrowed. Using a
                credit card to obtain a cash loan is often the most expensive
                way for consumers to borrow money.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Some issuers charge higher interest rates
                on cash advances than for purchases. As an example, one card
                issuer offers a 7.9% APR on purchases made with the credit card,
                but charges a rate of 21.65% APR on cash advances. Issuers are
                not required to disclose the cash advance APR rate in
                solicitations or on applications. However, the information is
                usually provided in materials sent with the credit card to the
                applicant. A cash advance can also be obtained with a credit
                card at a bank or an automated teller machine (ATM) or by using
                checks linked to a credit card account.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Several card issuers offer cash advances
                with 25-day grace periods. The transaction fee they charge for
                the cash advance, however, may be more expensive than simply
                paying interest from the date of the advance. In addition, if
                the cash advance is not paid off in full when due, finance
                charges are accrued at the cash advance rate beginning on the
                first day of the new billing cycle until it is paid back.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Below is an example of charges that could
                be imposed for a $200 cash advance that is paid in full when the
                bill arrives:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Cash Advance Fee = $4 ($200 x .02 = $4)</font></p>
                <font face="Arial">Interest for one month = $3 (18 percentS APR;
                $200 x .015 = $3)</font>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Total cost of cash advance = $7 ($4 fee +
                $3 interest = $7)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">In comparison, a $200 purchase with a
                credit card having a grace period would cost nothing if it is
                paid off promptly in full by the billing due date.</font></p>
                <h4><font face="Arial">Late Payment Fees</font></h4>
                <p><font face="Arial">Late fees are typically charged when a
                cardholder fails to make at least the minimum monthly payment by
                the due date. Some issuers charge a flat late fee, for example,
                $10. Other issuers charge a fee that is a percentage of the
                minimum payment due (e.g., 2 to 5 percent). Note the Schumer Box
                in Table 1 reveals the late payment fee is $10. Some issuers
                allow cardholders 10 or 20 days to pay their bill after the due
                date before a late fee will be charged. Other issuers, however,
                charge late fees immediately after the due date. To avoid late
                fees, mail payments in plenty of time to arrive before the due
                date. If payments are made at the bank’s branch or ATM, find
                out how long it takes payments to be processed. Some banks do
                not credit payments made at ATMs for several days.</font></p>
                <h4><font face="Arial">Other Fees</font></h4>
                <p><font face="Arial">In a review of credit card offers that
                were sent unsolicited to the authors, the following additional
                fees were discovered:</font></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Close-out account fee of $25 and
                    written notice to close a credit card account.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Inactivity fee of $15.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Annual fee of $25 to cardholders who
                    pay their bills in full each month.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Application fee of $100 for the
                    privilege of applying for the credit card.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Missed payment fees that consist of
                    increasing the lower advertised APR to the higher prime rate
                    plus an additional 12.9%.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Over credit-limit fees of $10 to $15.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Surcharge fees consisting of additional
                    charges on top of the APR. For example, one issuer tacks a
                    5.1% credit protection surcharge onto its 16.8% APR variable
                    rate card if the cardholder does not have other accounts at
                    that institution. The effective APR is 21.9% and there is no
                    grace period.</font></li>
                  <li><font face="Arial">Debt consolidation and transfer fees.
                    One of the credit card advertising pitches is “Transfer
                    balances from your other bank, gasoline, and department
                    store credit cards” to an issuer that offers a low
                    interest rate. Generally the offer is good for a limited
                    number of days or months. Loan consolidation is not a
                    benefit to the cardholder unless it is for the same or
                    shorter time period, or for the same or lower APR. Changing
                    creditors to whom money is owed may incur a transfer fee.
                    Cardholders who have consolidated several creditors into one
                    loan may be tempted to incur more charges because it
                    &quot;seems like&quot; they do not have as many creditors as
                    before requesting payments.</font></li>
                </ul>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Caution</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">The following caution is for credit card
                holders who use a low interest rate offer to transfer debt to a
                credit card with an existing balance at a higher rate of
                interest. Monthly payments made after the transfer may be
                credited to only the lower interest rate debt, not the higher
                rate debt.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">As an example, assume you have a credit
                card account with Bank A at an 18 percent APR. You have another
                credit card account with Bank B at a 21 percent APR. Bank A
                wants to increase customer account balances to draw more
                interest—so the offer is made to consolidate your loans from
                other credit card companies at a low introductory rate of 5.9
                percent APR for the first 6 months. The amount you bring into
                this account from credit card Bank B is credited to your Bank A
                credit card account. You now have one consolidated account at
                Bank A—but with two lines of debt—one that is charging 18
                percent APR and the other that is charging 5.9 percent APR. When
                you make a payment, the amount goes toward the newly
                &quot;consolidated&quot; debt at 5.9% APR, not the higher 18
                percent APR. The better policy would be, of course, for you to
                pay off the higher 18 percent APR debt first, and then apply the
                payments toward the lower 5.9 percent APR debt. If you find
                yourself in this situation and want to be sure your payments (as
                well as any dollars paid beyond the minimum payment) are applied
                to the higher APR, ask the institution for the appropriate
                procedure.</font>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Other Considerations</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Line of credit.</strong> A line of
                credit is the amount the card issuer will allow a cardholder to
                charge. It is listed on the notification or disclosure statement
                enclosed with a new card or renewal card and on the billing
                statement. Generally a line of credit large enough for
                emergencies and large purchases, but not so high as to encourage
                overuse of credit, is desired. Credit limits can usually be
                reduced or increased by contacting the creditor by phone. When a
                payment is made, the available line of credit may not reflect
                that payment for a certain period of time, such as 14 days. Some
                cards do not have 24-hour, 7-day customer service. This may be a
                consideration if you cannot make calls during working hours or
                when traveling away from home.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Billing cycle.</strong> Will the
                credit card holder allow you to change your billing cycle to be
                better timed with your pay day?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Incentive offers.</strong> Credit
                card companies often use rewards to entice consumers to use
                their cards. Examples of incentives offered include
                frequent-flyer miles, discounts on new-car purchases, free gas,
                free golf clubs and guaranteed tee-off times at golf courses in
                Florida. Consider whether the &quot;incentive&quot; could be
                obtained at less cost for cash. For example, Smart Money reports
                that if you charge $8,500 a year on a credit card carrying an
                average balance of $1,500, you would earn enough frequent-flyer
                miles to get a free domestic ticket in three years. But you
                would also be paying $265 in interest each year (17.65 percent
                APR), plus a total of $150 in annual fees. That means the
                &quot;free&quot; ticket would end up costing $945. For the same
                money, a consumer may be able to buy three round-trip tickets
                from New York to Los Angeles!</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Minimum monthly payment.</strong>
                The minimum monthly payment is the lowest dollar amount that a
                cardholder is required to pay each month to the financial
                institution that issued the credit card. Generally the minimum
                monthly payment is equal to 2 percent of the new balance or $10,
                whichever is greater. Some statements refer to the minimum as
                the &quot;Cardholder Amount Due,&quot; but that amount is not
                the total owed.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">The lower the payment, the longer it will
                take for you to pay off the balance and the more finance charges
                you will pay. For example, a cardholder who makes a minimum
                payment of $80 on an outstanding balance of $4,000 at a 21
                percent APR will take almost 10 years to pay off the loan. The
                cost of the interest is $5,592 with the cardholder paying a
                total of $9,592—almost twice the cost of the original loan.
                Obviously, making a minimum payment results in more finance
                charges being paid to the credit card issuer.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">If a cardholder does not pay anything, or
                pays less than the minimum, late fees will be charged. The
                credit card issuer may also cancel the card. In addition, there
                may be a negative report sent to a credit bureau. That report
                could affect the cardholder’s ability to obtain credit in the
                future. Some cards allow the card holder to skip a payment
                without a penalty, especially at holiday times. Although this
                sounds like the issuer is providing a break to the cardholder,
                interest will be charged during this period and more in finance
                charges will be owed than before.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Rebates.</strong> Some credit card
                issuers offer yearly cash rebates to entice consumers to use
                their cards. The rebate may be computed as a percentage of total
                charges. The actual dollar amount of a rebate is generally very
                minimal and many cards have ended their rebate offers.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Toll Free Number.</strong> Some
                cards do not have a toll free customer service number. This may
                be a consideration for people who need frequent help reading
                their statements.</font></p>
                <h3><font face="Arial">Summary</font></h3>
                <p><font face="Arial">As this Financial Fitness fact sheet has
                demonstrated, terms differ among credit card issuers, so shop
                around for the card that is best for your spending and repayment
                habits. Use the comparison chart to help you make a decision.
                Which credit card is best may depend on how you plan to use it.
                If you plan to pay bills in full each month, the size of the
                annual fee or other fees may be more important than the annual
                percentage rate and balance computation method. If, however, you
                expect to carry a balance monthly on your credit card purchases,
                the APR and the balance computation method are very important
                terms to consider. In either case, costs will be affected by
                whether or not the credit card issuer provides a grace period.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Once you have selected a credit card, keep
                abreast of changes that are announced either as enclosures with
                your bills or as a separate mailing. These announcements are not
                &quot;junk mail.&quot; Terms and conditions may change to the
                point that you decide it is time to shop for a different credit
                card.</font></p>
