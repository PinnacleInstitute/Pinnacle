				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Keeping a roof overhead is an important
                  concern when your income drops. When you rank your bills in
                  order of priority, chances are shelter and utilities top the
                  list.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When you’re under the financial stress
                  of reduced or lost income, one of the biggest expenses is
                  housing. Housing expenses include mortgage or rent payments,
                  insurance, taxes, household maintenance and repair, utility
                  bills, appliances and furnishings.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When family income drops, careful
                  planning can help you avoid eviction from your rental unit or
                  loss of your house. It is important to realize that when
                  you’re in financial difficulty and don’t relish talking to
                  anyone, you cannot ignore financial obligations, particularly
                  mortgage or rent payments.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Mortgage Payments</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">House payments can eat up as much as 30
                  to 40 percent of your family budget. What does a family do if
                  a job is lost and income stops? If your loss of income will
                  only be for a few months, you may be able to cut back on other
                  expenses to meet your mortgage payments.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Important:</strong> If you miss
                  a mortgage payment, you have defaulted on your contract and
                  your lender can begin foreclosure on your home. If meeting
                  your mortgage payments appears impossible, contact your lender
                  immediately before you miss the first payment.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Remember, most creditors want to work
                  with you. They would prefer to work out a way for you to
                  succeed in keeping your house if an alternative arrangement
                  can be worked out. You may be able to skip a payment or
                  arrange a lower payment. Go in person to see your lender and
                  take a copy of your net worth statement (see &quot;Take Stock
                  of Family Resources&quot;), a projection of income and
                  expenses (see &quot;Set Priorities for Spending&quot;) and a
                  plan for continuing to meet at least part of the payments with
                  your family’s financial situation in mind.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your family’s loss of income is
                  going to last a long time or be permanent, you will need to
                  consider other options. Could you rent a spare room or share
                  the house and the mortgage payments with others? Could you
                  rent your house to someone else and rent less costly housing
                  for yourself? (Check the affect this will have on taxes and
                  insurance coverage). Could you move in with relatives or
                  friends and share some of their housing costs while renting
                  your home? Could you sell your house and buy or rent less
                  costly housing?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As a last resort, you can deed your
                  house back to the lender. You might not lose much. If you have
                  been paying on a 30-year mortgage for 10 years, you have not
                  paid for much of the house yet–only about 10 percent. If you
                  choose deeding the house back to the lender in place of
                  foreclosure, and the house has decreased in value, you are
                  still responsible for the difference between the value of the
                  house now and the amount of the loan. If, by staying in the
                  house, you won’t have enough money for food and other
                  necessities, you may find it less stressful to leave the house
                  and find less expensive housing.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Rent Payments</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you rent, tell your landlord about
                  your income situation before your rent is due. Ask for a
                  temporary postponement until your income resumes. Offer to
                  provide service, such as painting, in exchange for rent.
                  Suggest making smaller payments for a month or two, with the
                  understanding that you will catch up when your income
                  increases again.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Be familiar with the terms of your
                  lease. Does your lease include a &quot;late clause&quot; that
                  would allow you five to ten days to pay overdue rent? Check
                  your lease for a statement about &quot;late charges.&quot; If
                  you do not have a lease or other advance agreement to add
                  &quot;late charges,&quot; none can be billed to you.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you do not pay your rent, Utah law
                  allows your landlord to evict you. Eviction is a five step
                  process. The first part begins when the owner gives you a
                  written notice to leave the premises. It should give you a
                  choice to either pay the amount owed OR move out within three
                  days. The count begins the day after you are served and
                  includes weekends and holidays. If you do not pay the money
                  within three days, the landlord goes to the second step, which
                  is to file a complaint and summons with the court. You must
                  reply in writing within three business days. If you file an
                  answer with the court on time, you will generally have a
                  trial. At the trial the judge will make a decision, which is
                  then put on paper and signed by the judge. If the landlord
                  wins, the judge will order you to move out and pay the
                  landlord whatever money you owe in rent plus triple damages.
                  You may also have to pay the landlord’s attorney fees. If
                  you fear becoming homeless after being evicted, there are
                  community services that can help you. See &quot;Take Stock of
                  Community Resources.&quot;</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Other Housing Costs</font></h3>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Utility Payments</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Monthly utility payments may include
                  charges for gas, oil, electricity, telephone service and
                  water. The customer has the full billing period (minus
                  processing time) to pay. Typically if the bill is not paid by
                  the billing date of the next month, a late penalty is assessed
                  on the amount outstanding. When bills are 12 days past due, a
                  notice is issued either to remind you that you are late or
                  that utility services will be disconnected immediately if
                  payment is not made, depending on your payment history.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you can’t make full payments on a
                  utility bill:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Contact the company right
                      away–before the due date and before additional service
                      is needed.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Propose a new payment plan based on
                      your current ability to pay. Take along information about
                      your income and expenses with you when you go to a utility
                      company.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Check with your local power company
                      to see if fuel assistance programs are available. What are
                      the qualifications?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Talk with family members to decide
                      how to safely reduce the use of your utilities to save
                      money.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you get behind on your utility
                  payments and service is disconnected, either the bill must be
                  paid in full or a pay agreement reached before service is
                  reconnected. An additional reconnection fee will be charged.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Insurance Payments</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Homeowner’s or renter’s insurance
                  protects you in case of loss or damage to property. If you
                  can’t make an insurance premium payment during a time of
                  reduced income, call or write your agent or the company. There
                  may be some leeway (a 10 to 30 day grace period) for a late
                  premium payment.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Note:</strong> Not paying
                  insurance on your mortgaged home is considered defaulting on
                  the mortgage.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When you talk to the insurance company
                  representative, explain your family’s situation and offer a
                  different payment plan. Check the possibility of smaller
                  premiums if you:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Change to a monthly, quarterly, or
                      semiannual payment plan with the same coverage. There will
                      be a service charge for making a smaller payment and this
                      is based on the amount of the payment. Check the total
                      yearly amount difference, and select the payment plan that
                      will give you the most savings and still fit into your
                      family’s spending plan.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Change the deductible.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Examine coverage on other buildings
                      and structures on your property.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Change to a more basic coverage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Check for possible discounts if both

                  <h3><font face="Arial">Real Estate Taxes</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you are unable to pay taxes, contact
                  your local county treasurer to learn about the procedures for
                  delinquent property taxes. Interest accumulates on unpaid
                  taxes, and you must pay this interest or it becomes a lien on
                  your property, just like the unpaid taxes. You’ll receive
                  notice of any actions taken as a result of non-payment of
                  taxes. Take these notices seriously. Eventually, unpaid taxes
                  will result in the sale of your property through auction.</font></p>
