                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Payday and cash advance companies allow you
                  to borrow money from your next paycheck. Requirements are that
                  you have identification, proof of income, and a banking
                  account. The consumer simply writes a check for the next pay
                  period, receives cash, and can begin using the money. Sound
                  too good to be true? There are many things to consider with
                  payday loans. The typical fee for using a payday loan is $15 -
                  $30 for every $100 borrowed. The APR (Annual Percentage Rate:
                  interest rate plus any fees included in the loan) is typically
                  very high and can get even higher if you are late paying off
                  the loan. Payday loans are usually for a two week period; the
                  APR can be around 400 percent and will get larger if late fees
                  are added. It is very common for consumers who use a payday
                  loan to run into trouble having the money available to pay
                  back the loan. When this happens, the consumer is left with
                  two choices:</font>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Let the lender deposit the original
                      check. If there are insufficient funds in your account you
                      run the risk of bouncing a check.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Extend the loan by making a minimum
                      token payment (this can range from $20 – $50) and write
                      another postdated check. This will make your balance
                      larger. It may be impossible for you to pay back this
                      doubled amount with your next paycheck.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Each loan policy will vary from company
                  to company and even state to state. Some companies will only
                  allow you to get a certain number of loans from them in one
                  year. Some consumers get into the trap of having loans with
                  multiple payday and cash advance companies. This is strongly
                  discouraged. It can lead to serious debt that is very
                  difficult to escape.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It is important to keep your finances in
                  order so you can avoid using payday and cash advance loans.
                  Before using this type of service, make sure that you have
                  exhausted all other resources. Re-evaluate the need for the
                  loan; can the purchase wait until you have the actual cash?
                  Will you honestly be able to pay the loan back in your next
                  paycheck? What are you going to do to ensure that this occurs?
                  Will you have the money to pay any roll-over fees if they are
                  needed? Do you have another resource from which to borrow? For
                  example, friends, family, your bank, even an advance from your
                  place of employment.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If the reason for getting a payday loan
                  is to pay off another creditor, consider discussing the matter
                  with that creditor. In some cases, it may prove beneficial to
                  take another late charge with a current creditor than to
                  borrow the money from a payday or cash advance company and
                  risk being in trouble with yet another creditor.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Payday loans are quick, easy, and often
                  seen as a harmless and friendly loan. Low income and minority
                  groups become an easy target. Higher income groups have also
                  been found to be customers. Consumers do not expect that they
                  will not be able to pay off the loan. Before they know it they
                  owe much more than the initial loan and they are caught in a
                  vicious cycle.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Stop the cycle before it starts. Educate
                  yourself, put what you learn into practice, and don’t let
                  your debts and wants in life get out of hand!</font></p>
