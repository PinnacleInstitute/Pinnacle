                Debt</font>

                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Do you find yourself living paycheck to
                  paycheck and not having money for everyday living expenses
                  such as food, utilities, and gas for the car? Do you buy these
                  necessities on credit? Do you find yourself borrowing money to
                  pay bills, or using credit to make it through the holidays? Is
                  there little hope of increasing your income? These are all
                  signs of financial instability and if continued there may be
                  serious consequences.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It has been recommended by the NFCC that
                  a reasonable debt load should be between 15 percent and 20
                  percent of net income or take home pay. To figure this, simply
                  take your net income and multiply it by .15 or .20. For
                  example, if your family’s monthly net income is $2,000 you
                  could safely afford monthly payments of $400. This does not
                  mean getting into $400 of debt each month, but having your
                  debt payments not exceed this amount. If your monthly debt is
                  below 20 percent you are doing well!</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you believe your debt is severe and
                  you do not feel like you can handle it on your own, seek help
                  from a not-for-profit counseling agency or through Consumer
                  Credit Counseling Services (CCCS). Just as you need to
                  thoroughly investigate a debt consolidation company, you
                  should also investigate any CCCS or nonprofit counseling
                  agency. If you need help locating a non-profit housing and
                  financial counseling service contact the U.S. Department of
                  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at <a href="http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hccprof14.cfm">www.hud.gov</a>
                  or call 1-800-569-4287</font></p>

                  it control you!</font></p>
