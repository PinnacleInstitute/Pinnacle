                Retirement Accounts (IRAs)</font>
				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) have
                  been available to all wage earners since 1982, created by
                  Congress as an incentive program to save for retirement. They
                  are available even if you have another retirement plan. IRAs
                  are sold by banks, credit unions, savings and loan
                  associations, insurance and mutual fund companies and
                  brokerage firms.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Traditional IRAs.</strong> If
                  you have income from working you can contribute up to 100% of
                  a year’s earnings or $20,000, whichever amount is less, to a
                  traditional IRA. This amount is reduced by the amount of any
                  contributions to a Roth IRA (see below). With a traditional
                  IRA, state, local and federal taxes on contributions and
                  earnings are deferred until the money is withdrawn. Starting
                  in 1998, if you have earnings of $30,000 or less you are
                  eligible for fully deductible contributions to a traditional
                  IRA. This eligibility limit will gradually rise to $60,000 by
                  the year 2005 for an individual, and to $100,000 for joint
                  filers by 2007.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Spousal IRAs.</strong> If your
                  spouse has no income from working, a spousal IRA may be opened
                  with a limit of $4,000 total combined contributions to both
                  &quot;traditional&quot; IRAs and Roth IRAs for the year. The
                  $4,000 must be split between two accounts, with neither one
                  exceeding $2,000 annually.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Roth IRAs.</strong> A new type
                  of IRA was created with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.
                  Contributions to a &quot;Roth&quot; are made with after-tax
                  dollars. However, all withdrawals, including accumulated
                  earnings on contributions, are tax-free, provided the owner is
                  age 59½ or older and has owned the account for five years.
                  Congress designed Roths to be much like a traditional IRA with
                  some important exceptions. They are only available to singles
                  with incomes up to $110,000 and married couples with incomes
                  up to $160,000. With a traditional IRA, no contributions are
                  permitted after age 70½. However, you may make contributions
                  to a Roth after age 70½ as long as you have earned income and
                  your adjusted gross income doesn’t exceed the limits
                  described above. Withdrawals from a traditional IRA prior to
                  the owner turning age 59½ are subject to a 10% excise tax.
                  However, early withdrawals from a Roth IRA can be made for
                  college expenses, qualified unreimbursed medical expenses,
                  payment of health insurance premiums by an unemployed person
                  and first-time home buyer expenses (up to a lifetime maximum
                  of $10,000), as long as the account has been in existence for
                  five or more years. If you have a traditional IRA, you must
                  begin required distributions on or before your required
                  distribution date, usually age 70½. If you have a Roth IRA,
                  you are not required to withdraw any amount during your
                  lifetime.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Rollovers from a traditional to
                  a Roth IRA.</strong> Starting in 1998, IRA owners with
                  adjusted gross incomes of less than $100,000 could roll over
                  part or all of the money in their existing traditional IRA
                  into a Roth IRA. However, to do so, the owner must pay income
                  taxes on the earnings plus deductible contributions of the
                  amount rolled over. So the traditional IRA owner must decide
                  whether it is better to pay some income taxes now and be able
                  to withdraw future earnings tax-free during retirement
                  (assuming the Roth is held at least five years and the owner
                  is age 59½ or older) or leave the money in the traditional
                  IRA where it will continue to grow tax deferred until
                  withdrawal. Generally, the longer the period until you
                  starting taking the money out of a traditional IRA and the
                  higher the expected rate of return, the more advantageous it
                  may be to roll over money from a traditional IRA into a Roth.
                  But if you are nearing retirement, it may not be worthwhile.
                  Also, the larger the amount being rolled over, the more cash
                  is needed to pay the income taxes due.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Withdrawals before age 59½.</strong>
                  Because Congress intended IRAs to be a retirement savings
                  vehicle, there is a 10% excise tax on any withdrawal when the
                  owner is under age 59½ unless she or he falls under the
                  following exceptions. Remember, if you qualify under an
                  exception, only the 10% excise tax is excused. The money
                  withdrawn is reported as income on your tax return and you pay
                  income taxes on it. The first exception is death; none of the
                  funds distributed from your IRA after you die will be subject
                  to the early distribution tax as long as the account is still
                  in your name when the distribution occurs. If you become
                  disabled, all distributions from your IRA are free of the
                  early distribution penalty. Another exception is triggered if
                  you spread distributions from your IRA in substantially equal
                  annual installments and those payments are designed to be
                  spread out over your entire life or the joint life of you and
                  your beneficiary. Under these circumstances, the payments will
                  not be subject to the 10% early distribution tax. If you
                  withdraw money from your IRA to pay medical expenses for
                  yourself, your spouse or your dependents, they are deductible
                  to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income.
                  Distributions you use to pay higher education expenses will
                  not be subject to the early distribution tax as long as they
                  are paid on behalf of you, your spouse, child or grandchild.
                  You may make a penalty-free early withdrawal to buy or build
                  your first home (up to a lifetime maximum of $10,000). You may
                  also make an early withdrawal for health insurance premiums
                  for yourself or your dependents if you are unemployed or were
                  recently unemployed for 12 consecutive weeks.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Withdrawals between age 59½ and
                  70½.</strong> The ages 59½ to 70½ are the &quot;penalty
                  free&quot; zone. The owner of a traditional IRA can choose to
                  withdraw the entire balance in the account or any amount as
                  needed without paying the 10% early distribution tax. However,
                  withdrawals from a traditional IRA are added to the owner’s
                  income for the year and taxed accordingly.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Withdrawals after age 70½.</strong>
                  Owners of a traditional IRA must begin taking distributions on
                  April 1 of the year after they turn 70½. Known as the
                  &quot;required beginning date&quot; (RBD), this date is
                  crucial because it is the absolute deadline for three
                  important tasks:</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You must take your first required
                      withdrawal from your traditional IRA. Your RBD (required
                      beginning date) marks the deadline for withdrawing the
                      required minimum distribution amount for your first
                      distribution year only. For all subsequent years, the
                      deadline is December 31.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You must decide whether or not to
                      recalculate life expectancies to determine the amount of
                      withdrawals. Recalculating means looking up your life
                      expectancy in a table every year instead of simply
                      reducing your life expectancy by one each year.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You must name one or more
                      &quot;designated&quot; beneficiaries to your retirement
                      plan. (There are rules about who is and who is not a
                      “designated” beneficiary.)</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You must withdraw at least the required
                  minimum from your IRA by your RBD or pay a heavy penalty. You
                  are permitted to take the money in one lump sum, or you can
                  take it out as you need it, for example in monthly or
                  quarterly installments, as long as the minimum amount is
                  removed from your account annually. So you must take the
                  minimum distribution between January 1 of the year you turn 70½,
                  and April 1 of the year after you turn 70½, which gives you
                  15 months to make your first withdrawal. For the second and
                  all future distribution years, you must take out the required
                  amount between January 1 and December 31.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Calculating the amount of
                  withdrawals.</strong> Calculating your required distribution
                  for any given year is just a matter of determining an account
                  balance for your IRA and dividing that balance by the
                  appropriate life expectancy. The resulting number is the
                  minimum amount you must withdraw from the account for that
                  year. According to the IRS, the account balance for computing
                  your required distribution each year is determined as of
                  &quot;the last valuation date in the calendar year before the
                  distribution calendar year.&quot; For the vast majority of
                  people, this date would be December 31 of the year before the
                  distribution. Once you have the account balance, you must
                  divide it by a life expectancy to arrive at your required
                  minimum withdrawal. The life expectancy can be your own single
                  life, or a joint life expectancy with a designated and
                  qualified beneficiary. Withdrawals can be in one lump sum, or
                  you may withdraw in monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually
                  amounts. Remember, you can withdraw more than the required
                  amount each year, but you may not withdraw less without
                  incurring a penalty.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you have more than one IRA, you must
                  compute the required distribution for each IRA separately, but
                  then you may add up all the computed amounts and take the
                  total from only one or several IRAs as long as the total
                  amount for each year is distributed before the deadline.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">How do you recalculate your life
                  expectancy? The IRS permits you to recalculate your life
                  expectancy in one of two ways:</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">For each year beginning with the year
                      you turn 70½, you can look up your life expectancy in a
                      table provided by the IRS. Using this method your life
                      expectancy will not reach zero until you die.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You can look up your life expectancy
                      in the year you turn 70½ and then simply subtract one
                      from that number each additional year thereafter without
                      using a table. This is called the &quot;term certain&quot;
                      method because life expectancy is fixed–it is not
                      recalculated every year. Using this method, if you live
                      beyond your term-certain life expectancy, your retirement
                      account will be completely depleted.</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As the IRA owner, you are permitted to
                  recalculate your life expectancy every year. If your spouse is
                  your beneficiary and you use a joint life expectancy, you can
                  recalculate your spouse’s life expectancy each year as well.
                  You may not recalculate the life expectancy of a non-spouse
                  beneficiary (for example, your children), however. The life
                  expectancy of a non-spouse beneficiary must be reduced by one
                  every year (in other words, the term-certain method).</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial">Once you decide whether or not you or
                  your spouse-beneficiary will recalculate, you cannot change
                  this decision during the remainder of your lifetime. If you
                  choose to do nothing by your RBD, you are deemed to have
                  elected to recalculate your life expectancy and your
                  spouse-beneficiary’s life expectancy each year. Naming a
                  designated beneficiary. Your RBD is also the deadline for
                  naming a &quot;designated&quot; beneficiary of your IRA. You
                  may name any person or entity (say, your local Humane Society)
                  but not every beneficiary qualifies as a
                  &quot;designated&quot; beneficiary as defined by the IRS. Any
                  person qualifies as a designated beneficiary and so do some
                  trusts. Charities, corporations and estates do not. If you
                  name a designated beneficiary you may use a joint life
                  expectancy with that beneficiary for determining your required
                  withdrawals. If your beneficiary is not a designated
                  beneficiary, or if you have not named a beneficiary at all,
                  you must use your own single life expectancy when calculating
                  the amount of withdrawals.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You may change your beneficiary at any
                  time, but the beneficiary named as of your RBD will affect how
                  your required distributions are calculated from that time
                  until your death, with certain rare exceptions.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">What are the benefits and consequences
                  of recalculating your life expectancy? If you elect not to
                  recalculate your life expectancy, you simply reduce your life
                  expectancy by one each year after your RBD, regardless of your
                  age or health (the “term-certain” method). On the other
                  hand, if you recalculate, you must look up the life expectancy
                  for your current age in the appropriate table each year.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The decision to recalculate your life
                  expectancy remains in place after you die. If you choose not
                  to recalculate, your life expectancy will continue to be
                  reduced by one each year even though you are dead. That means
                  your beneficiary will have the option of continuing to
                  calculate withdrawals the same way you did until the divisor
                  is reduced to one. This option saves the beneficiary of having
                  to take a distribution of the entire amount remaining in your
                  IRA and paying a lot of tax. A beneficiary can always
                  accelerate withdrawals, or take more than the required amount.
                  But if a beneficiary chooses to deplete the account as slowly
                  as possible, the maximum period over which distributions can
                  be spread is your remaining term-certain life expectancy.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If, however, you had been recalculating
                  your life expectancy and using the tables each year, your life
                  expectancy goes to zero in the year after you die, and your
                  beneficiary receives the entire amount in the account. If your
                  beneficiary is your spouse, they have the option to roll over
                  your account when you die. This option is only available to
                  spouses.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There is one big advantage to
                  recalculating life expectancies. Recalculating allows the IRA
                  owner to use a larger divisor when calculating required
                  withdrawals, which produces a smaller amount that must be
                  withdrawn each year. (Remember, your required withdrawal
                  amount is your account balance divided by your single or joint
                  life expectancy.) If you don’t need to draw on your IRA for
                  living expenses during retirement, but only withdraw the
                  minimum required amount in order to keep your taxes down,
                  recalculating allows you to leave more of your assets to grow
                  inside the IRA.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The benefits of recalculating increase
                  as you grow older. At 70, your life expectancy is 16 years. If
                  you use a term-certain method for computing required
                  distributions, your entire account will be depleted by the
                  time you reach age 86. But if you are recalculating, when you
                  reach age 86, you will still have a life expectancy of 6.5
                  years. Recalculation might not be the best choice for you. If
                  you use your single life expectancy to compute your
                  withdrawals, and choose not to recalculate your life
                  expectancy, then your account will be distributed over a term
                  certain whether you survive the term or not. If you die before
                  your account is depleted, your heirs may continue to take
                  distributions from your account over the remaining years of
                  the term, rather than all at once. If you are recalculating,
                  your life expectancy automatically goes to zero in the year
                  after your death and the remaining balance of the account must
                  be paid to your beneficiaries and added to their taxable
                  income for that year. (Although if your spouse is your
                  beneficiary, he or she can roll it over when you die.)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Recalculating with non-spouse
                  beneficiaries.</strong> If your beneficiary is not your
                  spouse, you must use one of two sets of rules depending on the
                  age of your non-spouse beneficiary. Recalculation is available
                  only to you and a spouse beneficiary. If you have a non-spouse
                  beneficiary who is no more than ten years your junior, you
                  could recalculate your own life expectancy and use a term
                  certain for your beneficiary; or you could use the term
                  certain method for both of you. If your beneficiary is more
                  than ten years younger than you, a special rule called the
                  Minimum Distribution Incidental Benefit (MDIB) applies. It
                  requires that you use a special table to find your joint life
                  expectancy. Again this rule applies only if your beneficiary
                  who is more than ten years younger than you is not your
                  spouse.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you name a non-spouse beneficiary who
                  is more than ten years younger than yourself, you still have
                  to decide by your RBD whether or not you will recalculate or
                  use term-certain. If you choose to recalculate, at your death,
                  your young beneficiary may use his or her remaining single
                  life expectancy to calculate the required minimum withdrawals.
                  If you had elected not to recalculate, your young beneficiary
                  would use your joint life expectancy as of your RBD, reduced
                  by one each year for the remaining withdrawals.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Here is one place where recalculating
                  may not make sense. If you name a beneficiary who is more than
                  ten years younger than you, for example your grandchild, you
                  have everything to gain and nothing to lose by using the
                  term-certain method. During your lifetime, you must use the
                  MDIB tables, therefore your election has no effect on
                  withdrawals made while you are living. But after your death,
                  your beneficiary looks up your joint life expectancy for your
                  first distribution year and reduces the number by one for each
                  year that has passed. If you had been recalculating, your life
                  expectancy would go to zero after your death and your
                  beneficiary would have to use only his or her single life
                  expectancy when computing future required distributions,
                  thereby depleting the account more rapidly.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Joint life with spouse
                  beneficiary.</strong> If your spouse is your beneficiary, and
                  you choose not to recalculate, your joint expectancy is
                  reduced by one each year even after the death of either or
                  both of you. So if both of you die, your beneficiaries may
                  spread withdrawals over the remaining years of your
                  term-certain life expectancy.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If your spouse is your beneficiary, and
                  you choose to recalculate, you have the option of using a
                  joint life expectancy and recalculating your life and your
                  spouse’s. But when the first of you dies, that person’s
                  life expectancy goes to zero. If your spouse dies first, then
                  when you die (or if you both die at the same time) both life
                  expectancies will be zero and the entire IRA must be paid out
                  to your beneficiaries the following year. If you die first,
                  your spouse could roll over your plan into an IRA of his or
                  her own.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Making the election.</strong>
                  Once you decide between recalculating life expectancy and
                  using the term certain method, how do you make the election
                  official? The IRS is clear that if you make no election and
                  your retirement plan is silent on the issue, then you and your
                  spouse (if your spouse is your beneficiary) are believed to
                  have elected to recalculate. If you do not want to
                  recalculate, you must take some steps to show what your choice
                  is. You could simply calculate and withdraw the appropriate
                  amount, keeping a record of both the method used and the
                  amount of the withdrawal. In the event of any questions, use
                  those records to demonstrate you have consistently applied one
                  method. Or you might show the calculation for your first
                  distribution year in a statement attached to your tax return
                  and filed before your RBD. The statement could read that you
                  choose to &quot;make recalculation inapplicable&quot; to your
                  life expectancy. If both you and your spouse choose not to
                  recalculate, both of you would sign and attach similar
                  statements to your tax return. As an extra precaution, before
                  your RBD you could send a copy of the signed statement to your
                  IRA administrator, indicating your intention not to
                  recalculate.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Trusts as beneficiaries.</strong>
                  You may name any person or entity you choose to be the
                  beneficiary of your retirement account. However, if the
                  beneficiary doesn’t fall under the definition of a
                  “designated” beneficiary you won’t be able to use a
                  joint life expectancy to compute withdrawals and reduce the
                  amount of required withdrawals. A designated beneficiary must
                  be a “natural person” as opposed to an entity like a
                  charity or a corporation. The only exception to the natural
                  person rule is a trust that meets certain criteria.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To determine if a trust qualifies, you
                  must consider the trust’s status as of your RBD or the date
                  the trust is named beneficiary of your retirement account. The
                  trust must be valid under Utah law, and irrevocable, meaning
                  you cannot change its terms or cancel it. You could name a
                  revocable trust your beneficiary (meaning one that can be
                  altered or amended at any time) as long as it become
                  irrevocable upon your death. In addition, the beneficiaries of
                  the trust must be natural persons and identified (your spouse,
                  your children, your grandchildren and so on).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">You must provide a copy of the trust to
                  the institution holding your IRA. If the trust is revocable,
                  you must give the institution a copy of each subsequent change
                  made to the trust, if any.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If the trust meets all of the above
                  qualifications, then the beneficiaries of the trust are
                  treated as designated beneficiaries for the purposes of
                  calculating your required withdrawals, provided they are
                  natural persons. If you name several beneficiaries of the
                  trust, you must use the life expectancy of the oldest
                  beneficiary when calculating life expectancies. If that
                  beneficiary is more than ten years younger than you are, the
                  MDIB rules will apply, even if the beneficiary is your spouse.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial">You can change beneficiaries of your
                  retirement account, but the method of calculating required
                  distributions does not change. It became irrevocable on your
                  RBD, remember, unless your new beneficiary is older than the
                  previous beneficiary. Then you must use the new
                  beneficiary’s shorter life expectancy when recalculating.
                  Even if your new beneficiary is a spouse whom you married
                  after your RBD, refiguring withdrawal amounts is not an
                  option.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you choose term certain, the term
                  must be equal to or shorter than your single life expectancy
                  or the joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary. Once
                  payments begin, the term certain may not be lengthened and
                  life expectancies may not be recalculated. What if you die
                  before age 70½? The IRS says you must start taking money out
                  of your IRA by your required beginning date (April 1 of the
                  year after you turn 70½ ). But what if you don’t make it to
                  that date? If you die before your RBD, then a law known as the
                  &quot;five-year rule&quot; applies. This rule is designed to
                  assure that the total amount in your IRA is completely
                  distributed within five years of your death and the taxes you
                  have been deferring are collected. Now if your spouse is your
                  beneficiary, he or she can defer distribution by rolling over
                  the IRA beyond the five year period. But if someone other than
                  your spouse is your beneficiary, they would receive the entire
                  amount as a lump sum or in payments spread over the five
                  years. How the account is distributed is governed by the rules
                  of the plan, the IRS only cares that it is all paid out in
                  five years. So the beneficiary could receive it all in the
                  first year, in installments, or not until the end of the five
                  years, depending on the plan.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">An exception to the five-year rule
                  occurs when you name a designed beneficiary for your plan and
                  you specify that payments may be spread over a period that is
                  no longer than his or her life expectancy. A minimum payment
                  would be required every year, beginning the year after your
                  death, and the beneficiary can always take larger payments in
                  any given year, but must at least take the minimum.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">An important caution, however, is that
                  the financial institution holding your IRA may have more
                  restrictive rules than the IRS and disallow the five-year
                  option. So check with the plan’s administrators to see how
                  assets are distributed in this instance. Why not name your
                  estate as beneficiary of your IRA? There are some significant
                  disadvantages to naming your estate as beneficiary. Your
                  estate is not a &quot;designated&quot; beneficiary and you are
                  considered to have no beneficiary for purposes of computing
                  lifetime or afterdeath withdrawals. As a result, distributions
                  could be accelerated under the five-year rule unless your
                  spouse is the sole beneficiary of your estate and is permitted
                  to roll over the account’s assets.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Withdrawals from a Roth IRA.</strong>
                  Congress designed the Roth IRA to be much like a traditional
                  IRA, but with some attractive adjustments. All contributions
                  to a “Roth” are made with after-tax dollars. Therefore,
                  all distributions are potentially tax free, including any
                  earnings realized on the account.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Roth contributions are limited to
                  earners with incomes under $160,000 if married and $110,000 if
                  single. And, unlike a traditional IRA, you may continue to
                  make contributions to a Roth after age 70½ (as long as your
                  income doesn’t exceed the limits described above). Also, If
                  you have a Roth IRA, you are not required to withdraw any
                  amount during your lifetime. You may leave the entire account
                  to your beneficiaries. The portion of your Roth IRA that
                  contains your contributions is never subject to income tax
                  when it comes out. You have already paid tax on the money.
                  Further, any distribution you take from a Roth is presumed to
                  be a return on your contributions. And they are not taxable as
                  long as the distribution is considered a &quot;qualified&quot;
                  distribution.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Any distribution of returns on a Roth
                  taken within five calendar years of when you established the
                  account can never be a &quot;qualified&quot; distribution. If
                  you die before the five years are up, your beneficiary must
                  wait until the five-year holding period has elapsed or the
                  distribution will not be qualified.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To be qualified (i.e., tax-free), a
                  distribution must also be one of the following:</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">taken after you reach 59½</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">taken after you become disabled</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">distributed to your beneficiary after
                      your death</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">taken to purchase a first home (up to
                      $10,000)</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Any withdrawals from a Roth that are not
                  &quot;qualified&quot; are treated much like a traditional IRA
                  distribution. The contributions you made will come out
                  tax-free, but the earnings are taxable.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you have a traditional IRA, you must
                  begin required distributions when you reach your RBD. If you
                  die after your RBD, a special set of distribution rules apply
                  (see above). But because you are not required to take
                  distributions from a Roth during your lifetime, you have no
                  RBD for that purpose. Consequently, it is irrelevant whether
                  you die before or after your RBD (or the date that would have
                  been your RBD for traditional IRA purposes). Instead the five
                  year rule or the exception to the five year rule will apply to
                  your Roth IRA regardless of when you die.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Summary.</strong> The rules for
                  withdrawing funds from a traditional IRA or Roth IRA are
                  complicated. People who withdraw funds before age 59½ may
                  have a 10% early distribution tax levied on their withdrawal
                  unless the distribution falls within one of the special
                  exception rules. Failure to withdraw the required minimum
                  distribution starting the year after reaching age 70½ may
                  result in a penalty equal to 50% of the undistributed amount.
                  IRA owners may require the assistance of a specialist, such as
                  a certified public accountant, certified financial planner or
                  attorney who specializes in taxes, to be sure they are
                  following the rules.</font></p>
