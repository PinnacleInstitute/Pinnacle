							<font face="Arial">Using a credit card has become a very common way for a family to 
								pay for the items it needs and wants. According to CardWeb.com, a firm that 
								tracks the credit industry, the typical American family of four carries about 
								$8,100 in installment debt–most of it in credit cards. At 18 percent interest, 
								that costs them nearly $1,500 a year or $125 a month and is money they can’t 
								save or spend on anything else.</font>
							<p><font face="Arial">How many credit cards do you have? Like the table provided below, 
									make a list of all your credit cards, who issued them, what kind they are, the 
									interest rate, credit limit and annual fee for each. If you don’t know your 
									credit limit or interest rate, look on your last month’s statement.</font></p>

							<p><font face="Arial">Many people are surprised at how many cards they have. They may 
									have two or three bank cards, a travel and entertainment card, department store 
									cards and gas cards. Most people find that they can get along with just one or 
									two bank credit cards. If you wish to cancel a card, cut it up and send a 
									letter to the card issuer. Ask them to notify credit reporting agencies that 
									the card is canceled &quot;at the customer’s request.&quot; Keep a copy of the 
									letter for your files.</font></p>
							<h3><font face="Arial">Control Your Credit</font></h3>
							<p><font face="Arial">Most people find they can get along with fewer cards than they 
									now carry. Decide which cards you actually need by asking yourself the 
									following questions:</font></p>
							<h4><font face="Arial">Can you use the card where you ordinarily shop?</font></h4>
							<p><font face="Arial">Because many places today accept bank cards, you may not need a 
									card that can only be used at one store, for example a department store, or a 
									specific gas card. Learn which cards are accepted where you usually shop.</font></p>
							<h4><font face="Arial">What interest rate are they charging?</font></h4>
							<p><font face="Arial">Look at the interest rate of each of your cards. Cards with 
									higher interest rates will cost you more money if you do not pay off your 
									balance each month. Keep the cards with a lower interest rate and cancel the 
									ones with higher rates.</font></p>
							<h4><font face="Arial">What is the credit limit?</font></h4>
							<p><font face="Arial">Try to match your credit limit with your credit needs. If the 
									limit is too low, you may not be able to use the card as much as you would 
									like. Is the limit too high? Ask to have it lowered.</font></p>
							<h4><font face="Arial">Are you paying an annual fee?</font></h4>
							<p><font face="Arial">If you are paying an annual fee, are you receiving enough 
									benefits from the card to justify it? If not, you may want to call the issuer 
									and ask to have the fee waived. If they say no, you may want to cancel the 
									card.</font></p>
							<h3><font face="Arial">More Cards Are Not Better</font></h3>
							<p><font face="Arial">You may get offers in the mail asking if you a credit card. These 
									offers often say that you are &quot;pre-approved&quot; for the card. They urge 
									you to accept quickly &quot;before the offer expires.&quot; Decide if you 
									really need another credit card before you accept an offer. How long will the 
									low &quot;teaser&quot; interest rate they are offering be in effect? How much 
									will they charge to transfer balances from other cards? What is the interest 
									rate on cash advances? What is the fee for a late payment? How do they compute 
									interest charges? The answers to all these questions can help you determine if 
									a new card is really offering substantial advantages.</font></p>
							<p><font face="Arial">You may be tempted to overspend if you have too many cards. You 
									may find it more difficult to keep track of purchases you have made and how 
									much money you have spent when you have several credit cards. Creditors may 
									also look at you as a poor credit risk because of the amount of credit you have 
									available. You may not carry large balances, but you have the potential to run 
									up large amounts of debt. The more cards you have, the less eager new creditors 
									may be to give you more.</font></p>
