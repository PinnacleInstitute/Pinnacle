                  <h4><font face="Arial">Life Insurance</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not everyone needs life insurance. Life
                  insurance is designed to protect anyone who is financially
                  dependent on you in the event that you die. If you do not have
                  any financial dependents you can use life insurance to pay
                  funeral expenses and even cover debt in the event of your
                  death. There are two basic types of life insurance: term and
                  whole life.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Term Life Insurance</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Money from a term life insurance policy
                  is granted only when you (the policyholder) die. This money is
                  only available for a predetermined number of years (5, 10, 15,
                  or 20 years, or up to age 65). However, if you stop paying the
                  premium, the insurance will stop as well. Premiums will go up
                  as you age unless you purchase decreasing term insurance.
                  Decreasing term insurance allows you to have premiums that do
                  not change, but your coverage will lessen as you age.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Whole Life Insurance</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Premiums are determined by your age when
                  you purchase the policy and will not change. This will
                  guarantee your beneficiaries a pre-determined amount of money
                  at your death. Whole life insurance can act as a savings
                  account. You can choose to have a cash value option that will
                  grow over time and allow you to borrow that money.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Universal Life Insurance</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This gives you the option of having the
                  protection of term insurance in addition to a cash value
                  option through an investment program.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Variable Life Insurance</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This lets you actively participate in
                  choosing which investments to include in your cash value
                  option. Remember, you will experience gains as well as losses
                  with any investment.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are many things that go into
                  deciding which type of life insurance will be right for you.
                  Whole life policies have upfront charges, and some term
                  policies are non-renewable after age 70. You should consider
                  how long will you need the coverage, and how much can you
                  afford. Research different policies and talk with a trusted
                  insurance agent.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Auto Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It is very important to have proper
                  coverage for your vehicle and any drivers. Below are important
                  aspects of auto insurance.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Liability</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">With liability coverage you are
                  protected in the event that you cause an accident. The
                  insurance company will pay those who were involved. This is
                  vital to auto insurance, but not the most expensive part.
                  Liability coverage is defined by three numbers. Some companies
                  require a minimum coverage such as 100/300/100. This
                  represents what will be covered if you cause an accident.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">100 = the amount of protection for each
                  person injured</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">300 = the amount allowed per-person
                  bodily injury</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">100 = the amount allowed per-accident
                  property damage</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">For example, in one accident $100,000
                  would be available for each person injured, $300,000 for each
                  person who received any bodily injuries, and $100,000 for any
                  property damage sustained in the accident. Each state has
                  minimum requirements. You may want to consider increasing your
                  coverage if you currently have only the minimum. You will be
                  expected to cover whatever your insurance will not if you
                  cause an accident.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Collision and Comprehensive Coverage</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Collision will cover any person driving
                  your vehicle with permission, as well as your vehicle.
                  Comprehensive will cover the vehicle as well as its contents.
                  Limits for replacement would be the current cash value minus
                  your deductible.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you have an older car, it may not be
                  worth it to have collision and comprehensive coverage,
                  especially if the car is not worth much more than your
                  deductible. If you choose not to have collision and
                  comprehensive coverage, your premiums will be lower.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Making necessary coverage more
                  affordable - There are many different ways to lessen the costs
                  of auto insurance. Some examples are:</font></p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Shop around, not all companies have
                      the same rates.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Take advantage of discounts:</font>
                      <ul>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Buy auto and homeowners insurance
                          from the same provider</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Good student discounts</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Maintain a good driving record</font></li>
                        <li><font face="Arial">Have good credit</font></li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Increase your deductible when you
                      choose to increase your coverage—this will lower your
                      premiums.</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Note:</strong> A deductible is
                  the required dollar amount in your insurance policy that you
                  must initially pay on any loss before insurance benefits can
                  be received.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A premium is a required fee that you
                  must pay on a set basis (monthly or yearly) to keep your
                  insurance coverage. Premiums assist in covering losses
                  reported to the insurance company.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Accidents are not planned: make sure you
                  are adequately covered!</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Home or Renters Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Anyone who is currently paying on a
                  mortgage will be required to have homeowners insurance. Even
                  when the mortgage is paid it is still wise to continue the
                  insurance. A home is a large investment and if faced with
                  disaster, your insurance will aid in the replacement of your
                  possessions and even your home if necessary. If you are
                  curently a renter and do not have many possessions you may not
                  need renters insurance. However, if you own items that you
                  would consider devastating to lose you may want to consider
                  renters insurance.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The following are important things to
                  consider when choosing a home or renters insurance policy:</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">First take an inventory of what you own</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Make a list of what you own. Include
                  style, model numbers, and how much the item cost. You may also
                  consider taking individual pictures or videotaping the items.
                  You should only need to include major purchases on this list.
                  In a disaster situation this list will help you as you make a
                  claim to your insurance company. Remember to keep this list,
                  video, or pictures at a location away from your home (for
                  example, in a safety deposit box or with a family member).</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Do you have any unusual but valuable
                  possessions?</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Now that you have taken an inventory of
                  your possessions, do you have any valuables? If you do, they
                  may not be fully covered under your insurance policy. You may
                  want to consider increasing the coverage for those items.
                  Depending on the increased coverage, your premium may go up,
                  but typically not very much per billing period. If the cost of
                  added coverage is too much for your budget you may want to
                  consider increasing your deductible. This means in the event
                  that something happens to your valuable you will be
                  responsible for more upfront before payment is made by the
                  insurance company. Consider the personal value of this item.
                  Will it be worth it to you?</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Replacement cost coverage</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This type of coverage will allow you to
                  have any lost items replaced for the current price. Without
                  this type of coverage you will only receive a portion of what
                  it would take you to replace the item. Insurance typically
                  only covers the current value of any insured item.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Flood and Earthquake Insurance</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A typical insurance policy will not
                  include coverage for damage due to flood or earthquake. These
                  types of insurances are more expensive, but it is up to you to
                  determine if you need the coverage. If you live in a flood
                  plain, flood insurance is required. If the nearby canal or
                  river were to flood, your home and possessions would be
                  covered with this insurance. If you live near a fault line,
                  earthquake insurance is not required. But remember that
                  earthquake damage is only covered with this specific
                  insurance. It is up to you to determine if you need this
                  coverage.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Medical Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Obtaining medical coverage through your
                  employer will most likely be less expensive than through a
                  private provider. Many people who think they are healthy may
                  not feel the need to have medical insurance. You might be able
                  to cover simple doctor visits from time to time, but if you or
                  a family member got really sick, could you afford the
                  medication or possible surgery? Visit with your employer’s
                  insurance representative to understand more about your health
                  coverage and if it satisfies your needs.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you find yourself in a financial
                  situation where you cannot afford insurance for your children,
                  or even for yourself, the following are some options available
                  to lower income households.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Medicaid</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Apply in person or by mail through the
                  State Health Department or Department of Workforce Services.
                  Low income families, children, seniors, or the disabled may
                  benefit from Medicaid. Medicaid is run by Federal and State
                  guidelines. In general, most medical services and
                  prescriptions are covered. Some programs even cover the
                  premium under Part B Medicare (described below).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To be eligible for Medicaid you must
                  meet your area program rules, be a U.S. citizen and meet the
                  limits for income and assets. There are programs that offer
                  emergency aid to those who are not U.S. citizens.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Medicare</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Apply through a local Social Security
                  office during open enrollment. There are two parts to
                  Medicare:</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Part A</strong> acts as medical
                  insurance to pay most costs of hospitalization, some inpatient
                  care, and home health services. Those who qualify receive
                  these benefits free of charge. There is a deductible for each
                  coverage period.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Part B</strong> acts as a
                  supplementary medical insurance intended to cover doctor fees
                  and many outpatient services. There is a monthly premium
                  (exceptions apply to those who have a Medicare Cost Sharing
                  Program or are actively involved with Medicaid). The
                  deductible is $100 per year and the co-pay is 20 percent.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Certain requirements must also be met.
                  Some of them are: You must be 65 years old, a U.S. citizen, be
                  eligible for Social Security benefits, or had employment
                  through the government where Medicare coverage exists. If you
                  are younger than 65 you may still qualify if you have been a
                  recipient of Social Security disability for least two years,
                  or if you have end-stage renal failure.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">For more information on Medicaid and
                  Medicare visit <a href="http://www.hcfa.gov">www.hcfa.gov</a>
                  or contact your local Department of Workforce Services or your
                  State Health Department.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Health Insurance Programs for your
                  Children</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some states have insurance programs
                  especially for children. Some typical requirements are: the
                  children must be under 19, be U.S. citizens and not currently
                  receiving health insurance coverage. There are also family
                  income limits. Please call your State Health Department or
                  local Department of Workforce Services to see if your state
                  offers a health insurance program for children.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Adult Health Insurance Programs</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Your state may have an insurance program
                  for qualifying adults. In general, these programs are not
                  offered to those who qualify for Medicaid or Medicare, or
                  already have insurance coverage. Income and age limits will
                  apply. Contact your State Health Department or local
                  Department of Workforce Services to see if your state offers a
                  health insurance program for adults.</font></p>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Cheaper health insurance through an
                  employer</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Health insurance may be cheaper if
                  received through your employer. This may require increasing
                  your hours or possibly switching jobs.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Umbrella Liability Insurance</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This policy is for personal
                  catastrophes. It protects against general and automobile
                  liabilities. An umbrella policy will cover a broader range of
                  losses and cover a much higher dollar amount than would be
                  normally covered under homeowners, auto, and professional
                  liability policies. You must first have basic coverage in
                  order to be covered under an umbrella policy.</font></p>
