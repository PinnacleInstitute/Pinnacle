                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">If you find it hard to buy necessities
                  every month, (needs, not wants) then income may be your
                  problem.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Before you blame your current job as the
                  reason for your financial trouble, you should take a look at
                  your values. Are you spending too much money on wants instead
                  of needs? If your current job is really the root of your
                  financial problems, here are some questions to think about:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you like your job?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Could you work more hours?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Is it possible to &quot;move up&quot;
                      in your current job?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Do you need more skills?</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Are your benefits (health, retirement
                      etc.) sufficient?</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Finding a Solution to the Problem</font></h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Is more education required? There are
                      many community colleges and technical schools that can
                      help individuals gain the skills they need to be more
                      successful in the workplace. A person doesn’t always
                      have to go back to school to get those extra needed
                      skills. There are resources such as workforce services or
                      vocational rehabilitation centers that will assist
                      individuals in gaining the skills they need to be more
                      successful.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Getting a second job for a period of
                      time may help relieve financial burdens. Temporary job
                      services can assist in finding employment for the holidays
                      or any other temporary time.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Are there any tax benefits available?
                      Some families can increase their withholdings to get more
                      money back each month. Consult an accountant before doing
                      this; you may be required to pay more taxes at the end of
                      the year.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">What talents or hobbies could be used
                      to make extra income?</font>

                        <li><font face="Arial">Babysitting children</font></li>

                  brainstorm!</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Families with children who are old
                  enough to get summer or holiday jobs can help to reduce the
                  financial strain. Children can learn valuable life skills when
                  they are responsible for buying their school clothes or paying
                  for their own entertainment. Parents can discuss with their
                  children what would be appropriate.</font></p>
