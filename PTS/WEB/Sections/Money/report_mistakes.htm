                Mistakes in Your Credit Report</font>

                  <p><font face="Arial">Every year millions of Americans use credit–to
                  purchase a car, to acquire big-ticket consumer durables or<br>
                  to buy the home of their dreams. When they apply for credit, the lender will usually want to see their credit<br>
                  report. A credit report is a history or record of past payment performance. Consumers can get credit precisely
                  because credit grantors can identify which consumers are likely to pay their bills. A credit bureau is a reporting
                  agency that maintains credit records on individuals who have ever used or applied for credit. This information is
                  then reported to subscribing credit grantors when consumers apply for more credit.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How Credit Bureaus Work</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Credit bureaus compile information from several
                  sources. Some of this information comes from the<br>
                  application forms filled out by consumers and submitted to creditors. Also, each month, department stores, banks,
                  mortgage servicing companies and other creditors send payment information about their customers to local or
                  regional credit bureaus. In addition, employees of credit bureaus go to tax clerk’s offices and courthouses to copy
                  records of bankruptcies, divorces, tax liens, and judgments onto credit reports. These millions of bits of information
                  are then sent to the nation’s three largest credit reporting
                  agencies, Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.&nbsp; With so many pieces of information floating into
                  the system, mistakes are bound to occur. Creditors and other contributors of information sometimes send in
                  erroneous data. Mistakes made by borrowers in filling out credit applications add to the misinformation. No one
                  really knows how many errors reside in credit files. But a mistake in your credit record can make you ineligible for a
                  loan, raise your insurance rates or cost you a job.</font></p>

                  <h3><font face="Arial">How Error Creep In</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Basically, there are three categories of errors. First
                  an error in the system, such as the computer not being able to determine if a Jack, John and Johnny at the same
                  address are the same person. Next are typing errors, like someone entering a 7 instead of a 1. Finally, using
                  nicknames, or using Bob and Robert on different loans, can give your credit record to someone else or saddle you
                  with that of someone else.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Precautions To Take</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Credit experts suggest that consumers get a copy
                  of their credit report annually to keep tabs on their<br>
                  financial status, or two months before a major financial transaction such as buying a house or car. To get a copy of
                  your credit report, send a written request with your full name (including middle initial and generation such as Jr.,
                  Sr., III, etc.), current and previous addresses for the past five years (with verification of your current address such
                  as a photocopy of a telephone or utility bill), with ZIP code, Social Security number, year of birth and spouse’s
                  name. Check all three bureaus when you review your credit history because each one may keep different
                  information than the other two. Anyone who has been denied credit because of
                  information furnished by a credit bureau must be given the name and address of that credit bureau by the user of the
                  report. Upon request of the consumer, the credit bureau must tell what information it has and how they received it.
                  The bureau must also disclose the names of any companies that have received your credit history in the past six
                  months and any prospective employers who were sent information in the last two years.<br>
                  If information contained in your credit report resulted in credit being denied, a raise in insurance rates,<br>
                  or you were denied employment because of it, you can obtain a free copy of your report if you contact the<br>
                  reporting agency within 60 days. Otherwise, you will pay an $8.00 fee for each report.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How To Correct Errors</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Most mistakes are relatively easy to reverse, but it
                  does take persistence. Sometimes you don’t know there is<br>
                  an error in your credit history until you are refused credit by someone else. In that case, look at your report to see
                  what problems appear. Then call or send a letter to the credit reporting agency explaining the mishap. Spell out
                  the inaccuracy, ask the bureau to verify and correct it, and ask for a corrected report.&nbsp;
                  The credit company will check with the creditor, and if the creditor can’t verify the unpaid bill or late
                  payment, your record is cleared. If the bill exists, the credit company starts the detective work of finding out
                  whether it really belongs to you. If you can prove the bill isn’t yours, the credit agency updates your file.
                  If the bureau stands firm, your next letter goes to the creditor. Include copies of supporting documents that
                  show the creditor is in error. Ask that a correction be sent to all the credit bureaus that the creditor reports to. Ask for
                  a copy of the letter to be sent to the bureaus. If you prevail with the creditor, write one more
                  letter asking the bureau to send corrected reports to you and to anyone who has received a copy of your report in
                  the past six months. Include a copy of the creditor’s letter
                  acknowledging the error. If the creditor won’t concede the error, you are left only one protection–the opportunity to
                  record in your credit file a 100-word letter that you dispute the error. (See box for a sample dispute letter).
                  Once you correct your credit report with one credit bureau, it should be automatically corrected at the others.
                  The credit bureaus also can’t put disputed information back into your report without telling you it is there.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How We Are Judged</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">An example of a good credit risk is a person with
                  no more than one late payment over 30 days in the past 12<br>
                  months. Among the items likely to prevent someone from obtaining credit are reports of at least two judgment liens
                  over $500; two or more late payments in a year; a repossessed car; and a bankruptcy. Some creditors also
                  may grow suspicious if several credit “inquiries” are listed
                  on a report within the last six months. That may mean a person is applying for a lot of credit elsewhere. Of course
                  it may also mean you are going to get a deluge of “preapproved”
                  offers in the mail.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Summary</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">As consumers, we can certainly thank automated
                  credit reporting for our easy access to bank cards and<br>
                  loans. Still, it is up to us to monitor our credit records and
                  see that the information reported in them is accurate. That’s why it is important to check with the major credit
                  reporting agencies at least once every two years, once a year if yours is a common name and you could be easily
                  confused with someone else. Then you can fix inaccuracies before they become a problem. It is important
                  to remember that it is our responsibility to insure that corrections are made and reported. The credit bureau will
                  not do this unless requested.&nbsp; If you feel that a credit bureau has not made
                  sufficient effort to resolve a problem, you can file a<br>
                  complaint with the Federal Trade Commission by contacting the Consumer Response Center by phone: 201-<br>
                  382-4357; by mail: Consumer Response Center, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580; or if you
                  have Internet access, by using the online complaint form at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov</a>.</font></p>
