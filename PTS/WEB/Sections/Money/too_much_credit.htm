                  personal loans as well as the credit card balances you usually
                  carry from month to month. Then enter your average monthly
                  payment for each loan and the amount you usually pay each

                  <p><font face="Arial">If you usually make only the minimum
                  monthly payment on your credit cards, you will be
                  underestimating your true debt. How much would you have to pay
                  each month to close out your credit card balances in six or
                  twelve months? Use that number to get a truer picture of your
                  debt level.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Now, look at what your debt rate is.
                  What percentage of your take-home pay goes to pay credit
                  debts? According to the Survey of Consumer Finance conducted
                  by the Federal Reserve Bank, the average American has a debt
                  rate of around 17 percent.</font></p>

                      Congratulations! You are in the safe limit and probably
                      feel little debt pressure.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>11 to 15 percent</strong> You
                      are in the safe limit but you may feel some debt pressure.
                      Be cautious about taking on more debt.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>16 to 20 percent</strong> You
                      are probably hoping that no emergency arises. Start
                      working on reducing your debt.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>21 to 25 percent</strong> You
                      are probably worrying about your debt load. It is time for
                      a dramatic change. You may need help from a credit
                      counselor.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>26 percent or more</strong>
                      You definitely have more credit than you can handle. You

                  handle more debt than others. Here are some signs that debts
                  are out of control. If you answer yes to more than two or
                  three of them, you need to work on trimming your debt load:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You pay only the minimum amount due
                      on your credit cards each month.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You buy so much on credit that the
                      amount you owe from one month to the next never goes down.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You take out new loans or get new
                      credit cards to pay off old ones.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You have to skip some payments.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You are borrowing to pay for regular
                      expenses like groceries because you do not have cash.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You are frequently late making your
                      monthly payments.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You must rely on extra income from
                      overtime work to make ends meet.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You must use savings to pay current
                      bills.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You have more than 20 percent of your
                      take-home pay committed to credit payments other than your
                      home mortgage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">You have lost track of how much you

                  <p><font face="Arial">If you need to trim your credit, start
                  now to make changes. One way is to use PowerPay.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The principle of power payments is that
                  as soon as one debt is paid off, you apply the monthly payment
                  from that debt to the next debt. By the time you have moved on
                  down the list, you are paying large monthly payments to the
                  remaining debts. The PowerPay computer program will help you
                  decide how to distribute these payments. Your total monthly
                  payments are not increased, only the distribution of those
                  payments changes.</font></p>
