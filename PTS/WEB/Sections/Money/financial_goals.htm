                  <font face="Arial">Goals are motivators. They provide focus
                  and direction. Financially, goals help us use the resources we
                  have to get the things that we want. Goals turn dreams and
                  wishes into reality.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Many people look at a spending plan (a
                  family’s financial goals) as a restriction. They feel it
                  keeps them from what they want. Feelings of frustration at
                  always being restricted often lead a family to stop planning
                  and looking ahead.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">But a spending plan can help us get
                  those things we want. The key is to select goals that are
                  really important to us; goals that will motivate us; goals
                  that will make some of our dreams and wishes come true; goals
                  that are ours, not someone else’s.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The point of goal setting is to look
                  ahead, decide what you want, and make a plan that will help
                  you get it. Without thinking, we sometimes end up planning for
                  unimportant events and overlook or avoid planning for
                  significant ones. To end up where we want to be, we need to
                  think about what we want and how we are going to get it.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Very few of us ever have a large enough
                  income to cover our list of wants. It seems to be part of
                  human nature to want and need more as our income increases.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Because of this reality, prioritizing
                  our needs and wants is essential. Most families can reasonably
                  focus on two major goals at once. Start with those of the
                  highest priority and then, rather than giving up the other
                  goals, write them down and begin working on them when money is
                  available. Success in achieving financial goals is increased
                  when family members take part in establishing and achieving
                  goals.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Involving family members in setting and
                  prioritizing goals is a great learning experience. It helps
                  them develop problem solving skills. It increases their sense
                  of being a contributing member of the family. And, it helps
                  them become aware of financial limitations.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Goals are important tools that help us
                  turn wishes and dreams into reality. Begin by prioritizing
                  your family’s wants and needs. Then focus your energy on the
                  things that matter most.</font></p>
