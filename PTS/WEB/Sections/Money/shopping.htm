                  <font face="Arial">Long-term care refers to a comprehensive
                  range of medical, personal, and social services designed to
                  meet the needs of chronically ill and disabled persons. These
                  services are designed to meet needs over an extended period of
                  time and may be delivered in the home, in a community-based
                  program such as an adult day care center, or in a nursing
                  home. What many people don’t understand is that standard
                  health insurance policies, Medicare, and Medicare-supplement
                  (&quot;Medigap&quot;) policies cover little in the way of
                  long-term care expenses. That is why the private insurance
                  industry is now offering long-term care insurance policies.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not everyone should or can get a
                  long-term care insurance policy. For some, a long-term care
                  policy is an affordable and attractive form of insurance which
                  allows them to protect assets for their spouse and children.
                  For others, the cost is too great and the insurance benefits
                  they can afford are insufficient for their needs. Not all
                  potential buyers can qualify for long-term care insurance
                  because of age and health status restrictions. Each person
                  should carefully examine his or her needs and resources to
                  decide whether long-term care insurance is appropriate.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Sells Long-Term Care Insurance?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Private insurance companies sell
                  long-term care policies. They may sell them to individuals
                  using sales agents or sometimes through the mail without using
                  agents. Some companies sell coverage through senior citizen
                  organizations, fraternal societies, continuing care retirement
                  communities and other groups. Some employers now offer
                  long-term care policies to their employees, their employees’
                  parents, and their retirees.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Should You Buy Long-Term Care
                  Insurance?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Your decision whether or not to purchase
                  long-term care insurance, and if so, which policy to select,
                  should be based on a number of factors: First, your assessment
                  of your chances of needing this kind of care.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Second, what services exist in your
                  community that can help you live independently? Third, which
                  of these services are you eligible to receive or can afford to
                  purchase? Fourth, what other resources are available to you,
                  especially family support? Finally, can you pay the monthly
                  premium with no more than 5% to 7% of your income? Premiums
                  will make up a larger and larger portion of your budget if
                  they increase faster than your future income. If paying the
                  premiums is going to cause you financial hardship, you should
                  carefully consider your alternatives. You could spend years
                  paying on a policy that becomes too expensive just at the
                  point in your life when you need it most.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Who Should You Buy Insurance From?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">For a variety of reasons, consumers have
                  little assurance that the company they buy from today will pay
                  their nursing-home bill 15 or 20 years from now. In the four
                  years between a 1988 Consumers Report investigation of
                  long-term care insurance providers and 1991, one quarter of
                  the companies that were rated were no longer selling long-term
                  care insurance (&quot;An empty promise to the elderly,&quot;
                  June, 1991).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you are interested in purchasing
                  long-term care insurance, begin by evaluating the financial
                  stability and soundness of the companies you are considering.
                  The best companies are often the largest companies that have
                  sold the most policies and been in the long-term care
                  insurance business for some period of time. You can also use
                  independent rating services to judge insurance providers. You
                  can find these resources in the reference section of your
                  local library. Look for an A+ rating from A.M. Best (www.ambest.com/
                  908-439-2200) and no less than an AA rating from Standard
                  &amp; Poors (www.standardandpoors.com/ 212-208-1527) or Weiss
                  Research Inc. (www.weissratings.com/ 800-289-9222).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Be an informed consumer. There are no
                  standardized long-term care policies. Many companies are
                  writing policies and many combinations of benefits and
                  coverages are available. Be aware that even agents selling
                  long-term policies can be confused by what is and is not
                  covered. Once you narrow your choice to two or three good
                  insurance companies, read the policies very carefully. Do not
                  just read the marketing materials, but read the policy
                  contract as well. You are legally bound by the policy
                  contract, not the marketing materials or the agent’s word.
                  Policies vary as do people’s situations. Buy a policy that
                  meets your individual circumstances.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Is Covered by Long-Term Care
                  Insurance?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you buy a long-term care policy,
                  you’ll want to be sure that you have coverage for a variety
                  of long term care services. Some policies cover only stays in
                  nursing homes. Others cover only care in your home. Still
                  others cover both nursing home and personal care services
                  provided at home. In addition, some policies will cover
                  services offered by adult day care centers, assisted living or
                  other community-based facilities.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Nursing home coverage usually means the
                  policy will pay for all three types of care provided by
                  nursing homes: skilled care (daily nursing and rehabilitative
                  care that is based on a doctor’s orders and performed only
                  by, or under the supervision of trained medical personnel);
                  intermediate care (occasional nursing and rehabilitative care
                  that is based on a doctor’s orders and performed only by, or
                  under the supervision of, trained medical personnel), and
                  custodial care (care based on a doctor’s orders that is
                  primarily for the purpose of meeting personal needs such as
                  help in eating, bathing, dressing and walking. Custodial care
                  may be performed by personnel who do not have professional
                  medical training).</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">A policy that covers only skilled
                  nursing care is not very useful, since most people who need
                  nursing home care do not need skilled care for an extended
                  period of time, if at all. Some policies cover intermediate or
                  custodial care only if you receive skilled care or are
                  admitted to a hospital first. This is a serious limitation.
                  Some newer policies make no distinction among the three types
                  of nursing home care and will pay for any care you need,
                  provided you meet their eligibility requirements. Read the
                  language of the policy carefully to see which type(s) of care
                  are covered.</font></p>
                  <font face="Arial">Home health care coverage is less
                  straightforward.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some policies pay benefits only for
                  skilled nursing care performed in your home by registered
                  nurses, licensed practical nurses, occupational, speech, or
                  physical therapists. Other policies only cover the services of
                  home health aides employed by licensed home care agencies.
                  More rare are policies that pay for someone to come to your
                  home and cook meals or run errands. Since you never know which
                  kind of care you will eventually need, it is best to look for
                  a policy that pays for many types of home care services.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Where Is Service Covered?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It is not enough to know what services
                  are covered, you also need to know where services are covered.
                  If you are not in the right type of facility, the insurance
                  company can refuse to pay. The most liberal policies provide
                  for care in any state-licensed facility. Others tend to limit
                  the kinds of facilities where you can receive care. For
                  example, many will not cover custodial care unless it’s
                  provided in a skilled or intermediate nursing facility. Others
                  list by name the kind of facilities they will and will not
                  cover. Some policies explicitly state they will cover stays in
                  an assisted living facility. Others may or may not cover
                  assisted living as part of an &quot;alternative plan of
                  care.&quot; Some will say the facility must care for a certain
                  number of patients or require a staff member to be on the
                  premises 24 hours a day, have a doctor on call, and the
                  facility must be able to supervise medications. Check these
                  requirements very carefully. Sometimes a policy’s
                  requirements differ from the state’s licensing requirements
                  and you find yourself with a policy that won’t pay for
                  custodial care in a particular facility even though your state
                  has licensed that facility to provide custodial care. Some
                  Medicare-certified facilities may not be eligible for payment
                  for skilled nursing care under a long-term care policy, so you
                  need to check.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Do Long-Term Care Policies Cost?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The actual premium you will pay depends
                  on many factors, including your age at the time you apply, the
                  level of benefits you choose, and the length of time you are
                  willing to wait until benefits begin.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Age.</strong> Most insurance
                  companies do not offer long-term care insurance to people
                  younger than age 50. Exceptions include employer-provided
                  long-term care insurance plans and a small number of new
                  offerings from private insurers. Most companies will not sell
                  coverage to people 80 years of age or older. According to some
                  elderlaw attorneys, the best time to buy is when you are in
                  your mid-50s to mid-60s. A 55-year old buying an average
                  policy today might pay about $800 a year in premiums. A
                  75-year old would pay over $3000 per year for the same policy.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Unless you choose inflation protection
                  at the time you buy the policy, you will most likely face
                  increasingly higher annual premiums. Once a policy is issued,
                  the premium is supposed to remain the same regardless of
                  deteriorating health, claims filed, or increasing age, except
                  for across-the-board increases for all policyholders your age
                  who bought the same policy. Therefore, the younger you are
                  when you first buy a policy, the lower your annual premium
                  will be, but you will pay premiums for a longer period of
                  time. And, you will pay higher premiums when the company makes
                  across-the-board increases for your class of policyholders.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Benefits.</strong> The premium
                  is directly affected by the size of the daily benefit and the
                  length of time benefits will be paid. In general, long-term
                  care policies limit benefits to a maximum dollar amount
                  payable per day or a maximum number of days. They often have
                  separate benefit limits applied to nursing home and home
                  health care within the same policy. For example they may offer
                  five years of nursing home coverage and two years of home
                  health care coverage.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are two ways companies define a
                  policy’s maximum benefit period. Under one definition, a
                  policy may offer a one-time maximum benefit period. Under this
                  definition, a policy with five years of nursing home coverage
                  would pay just once in a policyholder’s lifetime. Other
                  policies offer a maximum benefit period for each &quot;period
                  of confinement.&quot; Under this definition, a policy with a
                  five-year maximum benefit period would cover more than one
                  nursing home stay lasting up to five years each if the stays
                  were separated by six months or more. The term
                  &quot;restoration of benefits&quot; refers to a feature found
                  in some policies where your full benefit is restored if you
                  are in a nursing home for less than your entire benefit
                  period.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Elimination or deductible periods. This
                  refers to the number of days you must be in residence at a
                  nursing home or the number of home care visits you must
                  receive before policy benefits begin. Most policies offer a
                  choice of deductible periods for nursing home care ranging
                  from 0 to 100 days. A 20-day elimination period means that
                  your policy will begin paying benefits on the 21st day
                  provided you meet all other requirements. The longer the
                  elimination period, the lower the premium. During the
                  elimination period, you’ll have to cover the cost of nursing
                  care yourself. That means you will have to weigh the trade-off
                  between paying a higher premium for a policy that covers you
                  soon after entering a nursing home or paying out of your own
                  pocket for the first few months you spend there.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Is NOT Covered?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">All policies have
                  &quot;gatekeepers&quot;–restrictions that determine whether
                  or not you are eligible for benefits. Just because you have a
                  policy doesn’t mean you will actually receive benefits. In
                  your policy, you’ll find these discussed in a section called
                  &quot;eligibility for benefits,&quot; &quot;qualifying for
                  benefits,&quot; or &quot;benefit conditions.&quot; There are
                  wide variations among policies when it comes to gatekeepers.
                  Some policies contain more than one of these restrictions.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Under some policies, you’ll qualify
                  for benefits if your doctor orders care. Another type of
                  gatekeeper requires that care be medically necessary for
                  sickness and injury. So if you need nursing home care, but are
                  not sick or injured, you may not qualify for benefits. An
                  insurance company doctor usually determines whether you are
                  sick or injured.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Most insurance companies will require
                  that a period of time passes before they pay for care related
                  to a health problem you had when you became insured. Such
                  health problems are called pre-existing conditions. Most
                  policies exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions for six
                  months. If you need long-term care for a condition for which
                  treatment was either under way or had been recommended before
                  you took the policy, you may be denied benefits. Alcoholism
                  and drug use are usually not covered, along with illnesses
                  caused by an act of war or as the result of an attempted
                  suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injury.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Another type of gatekeeper requires that
                  you be unable to perform a certain number of &quot;activities
                  of daily living,&quot; commonly referred to as ADLs. There are
                  seven of them–bathing, dressing, walking, moving from bed to
                  chair, using the toilet, maintaining continence and eating.
                  Some policies also have a gatekeeper for mental or nervous
                  disorders. A family history of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
                  disease may exclude you from coverage under some, but not all,
                  long-term care policies. Even though insurance regulators
                  require policies to cover Alzheimer’s disease, a
                  policyholder who has the disease may still be denied benefits
                  if she or he is physically able to perform the activities of
                  daily living specified in the policy. Some policies say you
                  must be unable to perform three out of the seven before you
                  qualify as disabled; others choose six activities and say you
                  must fail to perform two or three of them; still others pare
                  the list to five and say policyholders must be unable to
                  perform two of them. Carefully study the policy before you buy
                  because there is a big difference among companies when it
                  comes to deciding if the company will pay or deny benefits.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Most long-term care policies will
                  exclude coverage for expenses outside the United States,
                  dental treatments unless due to accidental injury, and
                  expenses caused by non-organic psychological disorders such as
                  anxiety and depression. If your policy excludes care outside
                  your local area, you will not be covered for any services you
                  need while staying with a family member or friend in another
                  part of the country, while at a vacation home, or while
                  traveling on vacation.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Features of Long-Term Care Insurance
                  Policies</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Carefully read the provisions of the
                  policy you are considering buying. Because policies for
                  long-term care vary so much, even the agent’s answers to
                  your questions may not be right. Be sure that you understand
                  the definition of any language explaining what expenses are
                  covered or not covered. Most long-term care policies offered
                  today include the options and provisions detailed below. A
                  comparison checklist to help you evaluate different policies
                  follows this section to assist you in making your personal
                  decision about long-term care insurance and finding the best
                  policy to fit your needs.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Renewability</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Most long-term care policies are
                  guaranteed renewable; they cannot be canceled as long as you
                  pay your premiums on time and as long as you have told the
                  truth about your health on the application (more on this
                  below). Check for this provision carefully. The renewability
                  provision is normally found on the first page of the policy
                  and specifies the conditions under which the policy can be
                  canceled and when premiums may increase. The insurance company
                  should never have the sole option of canceling the policy.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Waiver of Premium</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Some long-term care policies will allow
                  you to stop paying premiums during the time you are receiving
                  benefits. Read the policy carefully to see if there are any
                  restrictions on this provision, such as a requirement to be in
                  a nursing home for any length of time (usually three to six
                  months) before premiums are waived. Once you are discharged,
                  the premiums will resume. This type of provision could save
                  you money while you are receiving care.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Non-forfeiture benefits</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Non-forfeiture benefits return to
                  policyholders some of their investment in a policy if they
                  drop their coverage after a number of years. Without a
                  non-forfeiture benefit, your loss could be substantial if you
                  drop the policy in 10 or 20 years without using any of the
                  policy’s coverage. The company may offer the policyholder a
                  reduced benefit paid-up policy in which part of the benefits
                  are payable after they drop the coverage. Other insurance
                  companies may offer a return of premium benefit under which
                  they return all or a portion of the premiums.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Death benefits</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not all policies offer death benefits.
                  Death benefits refund to your estate any premiums paid minus
                  any benefits the company paid on your behalf. To receive these
                  benefits, you must have paid premiums for a number of years.
                  At some companies, death benefits are payable only if the
                  policyholder dies before a certain age, usually 65 or 70.
                  Adding a death benefit provision can increase the cost of a
                  policy.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Inflation Coverage</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Inflation protection can be one of the
                  most important selections you make on a long-term care policy.
                  You may be hesitant to purchase inflation coverage, since it
                  adds between 25 to 40 percent to a policy’s cost. However,
                  unless your policy provides a way for your daily benefit to
                  increase, years from now you may find yourself needing nursing
                  home care but owning a policy that pays only a quarter of the
                  total cost of nursing home services.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Insurance companies use two methods to
                  add inflation protection to their policies. Some allow you to
                  buy additional coverage every few years at the current price
                  the company is charging. You’ll pay a new premium based on
                  your age at that time. This allows the price of buying
                  additional coverage to go up rapidly. The second way insurers
                  offer inflation protection is to provide for automatic benefit
                  increases. The daily benefit increases by a fixed percentage
                  for a certain period of years. Even though the automatic
                  increases are a fixed percentage amount, the dollar amount of
                  the increases from year to year will differ, depending on
                  whether the inflation adjustment is &quot;simple&quot; or
                  &quot;compounded.&quot; Compounding can mean a big difference
                  in the size of your benefit. An $80 daily benefit that
                  increases by a simple 5% a year will be worth $60 in 20 years,
                  but if it is compounded, it will be worth $212.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Disclosure</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you decide to purchase long-term care
                  insurance, filling out your medical history completely and
                  accurately on the application is very important. It is used by
                  the insurance company in assessing your eligibility for
                  coverage. Some companies will examine your current medical
                  records and ask for a statement from your doctor. If the
                  salesperson completes the application form for your long-term
                  care policy, read it over carefully before you sign and change
                  any entries that are not 100% correct. Never guess. Do not
                  answer a question unless you understand it. It is not easy to
                  remember every illness you ever had and when you had it. It is
                  better to state that you cannot recall and provide the name
                  and address of the doctor whose records would have the
                  necessary information than to say that you do not know. Some
                  insurance carriers will not investigate your health history
                  until you file a claim and then they will go over your record
                  with a fine tooth comb, looking for every conceivable reason
                  why they should deny benefits. If you have made a full and
                  complete disclosure, the insurance company cannot legally deny
                  coverage.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Shopping Around</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Long-term care insurance policies vary
                  considerably in costs and benefits. Shop around and compare.
                  Check with several companies and agents before you buy. Be
                  sure to evaluate benefits, the types of facilities you have to
                  be in to receive coverage, the limitations of coverage, the
                  exclusions, and the premiums. Take your time. Don’t let
                  anyone pressure or scare you into making a quick decision. Ask
                  the agent to give you a written outline of the coverage you
                  will be buying. Then make sure that you know what the policy
                  covers and what it does not. If you have questions the agent
                  cannot answer, call or write to the company and ask your
                  questions. When you receive your policy, read it again and
                  make sure it provides the coverage you want. If you decide you
                  do not want the policy after you purchase it, you can cancel
                  the policy and get a full refund if you do so within 30 days.
                  This is called a &quot;free-look&quot; provision. Answering
                  the following questions can help you compare policies and make
                  an informed decision.</font></p>
