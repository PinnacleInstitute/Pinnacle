                      <font face="Arial">There are two things you can do when
                      expenses are greater than the income in your spending
                      plan. You can either spend less or earn more. Though it
                      sounds very simple, those are the two options you have
                      when spending is greater than income. One way to close the
                      gap is to spend less by conserving. Turn the thermostat
                      down during the winter. Turn it up in the summer. Combine
                      shopping trips, carpool or walk, when possible. Take
                      shorter showers, do larger loads of laundry, and rinse
                      laundry in cold water. Share tools and equipment with
                      neighbors and friends instead of buying them yourself.</font>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Cutting back is another way to spend
                      less. Eat out less often. Limit long distance calls. Buy
                      only what you need. Eliminate special features on
                      telephone or cellular service. Look for fun things to do
                      as a family that don’t cost a lot. Share magazine
                      subscriptions, books, etc., with others.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Consider using alternative
                      resources. Buy generic or house brands instead of name
                      brands. Learn more do-it-yourself skills. Choose less
                      expensive restaurants or vacation spots. Check out books
                      and other material from the library. Use public parks and
                      facilities instead of expensive health clubs.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Spend less by not buying things. Ask
                      yourself if you really need the item or if there is
                      something else you want even more. Learn to say,
                      &quot;No&quot; to yourself, your children, and sales
                      people. Resist when you feel pressured to buy something.
                      Don’t buy on credit unless it is absolutely necessary.</font></p>
                      <p><font face="Arial">Increase income by upgrading
                      job-related skills or finding a better paying job. Work
                      overtime or find a second job. See if other family members
                      can work for pay. Compare different savings and investment
                      alternatives to get a good rate of return. Making an
                      effort to incorporate these money saving tips and others
                      will allow you to bridge the gap between income and
                      expenses in your spending plan.</font></p>
