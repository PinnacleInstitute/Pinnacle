                      This includes tuna, powdered milk, cheaper vegetables and

                      bran to oatmeal or pancakes or instead of buying steak
                      when on sale compare portion price to that of chicken.</font></li>

                      Reducing your weight can make a significant difference on
                      your food bill.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Waste nothing.</strong> This
                      includes making sure that children finish meals, cooking a
                      turkey carcass for soup stock, and eating leftovers.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Eat fewer meat and potato
                      meals.</strong> Casseroles, soups, stews, stir-fry meals,
                      etc., are generally less expensive and better for your
                      health.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Experiment with making your
                      own mixes</strong>. Instant non-fat dry milk in mixes
                      makes the mixes very economical to use. Take one day or
                      evening and make several mixes at once. (soups, hot cocoa,
                      etc.)</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Use your food storage.</strong>
                      Change your thinking to using your food supply rather than
                      your food storage.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Shop alone after you have
                      eaten</strong>. Statistics indicate that people buy more
                      when they are hungry or accompanied by others, especially
                      children. Stay on the outer edges of the store. Inner
                      aisles have pre-packaged high fat foods that your body and
                      checkbook can do without.</font></li>
                    <li><strong><font face="Arial">Plan meals in advance
                      according to grocery store ads.</font></strong></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Use unit price data.</strong>
                      Compare the cost of similar products of various sizes by
                      weight, volume, or count. Check to see if larger
                      quantities are more economical than smaller ones.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Be a brand switcher.</strong>
                      Different brands of the same product can be roughly equal
                      in quality and nutritional value yet vary widely in price.
                      Experiment with the products carrying store labels.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Learn nutritional
                      alternative.</strong> Study up on the nutrients essential
                      for health and which foods provide them. Protein, for
                      example, comes in many forms. A meal containing beans,
                      rice, wheat, corn, or milk can be as rich in protein as
                      one featuring sirloin steak. Read labels, compare values.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Try new meats. </strong>Grains
                      for cattle feeding are expensive in relation to the amount
                      of meat produced. Meat from grass-fed cattle and calves is
                      less expensive and is more healthful since it has less
                      fat. Since it is leaner, it shouldn't be cooked too long
                      or at a temperature that is too high.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Try cheaper cuts.</strong>
                      Learn how to cook these cuts. Though the taste is
                      different, you might be pleasantly surprised. Try
                      marinating a cheap cut instead of using the more expensive
                      piece packaged expressly for a certain dish.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Buy the serving</strong>.
                      Don't ignore the more expensive boneless cuts of meat.
                      Though bony meats are cheaper per pound, they yield less
                      edible meat per pound.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Get out of the rut.</strong>
                      Get out the cookbooks and try something new. Consider
                      making from scratch many of the things you habitually buy
                      in prepared form. Attend cooking classes that are held
                      locally for new ideas.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Insist on freshness</strong>.
                      The date marked on all perishable foods is the pull date,
                      the last day on which the product can remain on the shelf
                      in the store. It is not a spoil date. You may be able to
                      get a discount on these items.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Buy quantities you can use. </strong>Large
                      quantities are often bargains, but only if they will keep
                      safely until you can use them. Store them properly. Buy
                      fresh fruits and vegetables at their peak season, when
                      prices are usually lowest.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Consider group strategies.</strong>
                      A neighborhood group might save by buying in bulk directly
                      from wholesalers and farmers. Or a shopping club could
                      check the ads for specials, then send members on shopping
                      trips to different stores to buy for the whole group. Some
                      stores will honor other stores' sales or promotional
                      items.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Save on cereals and baked
                      goods. </strong>There are two benefits in buying
                      unsweetened cereals. They cost less than sweetened
                      cereals, and you can control the amount of sugar you or
                      your children consume.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Save on milk and eggs.</strong>
                      Nonfat dry milk commonly costs about half as much as the
                      wet variety, and you can use it for cooking or for
                      drinking. The distinct taste of nonfat dry milk when used
                      in cooking is hard to detect. Determine which size of eggs
                      is the better buy.</font></li>
