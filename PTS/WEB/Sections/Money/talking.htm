				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Money is a problem for nearly everyone.
                  Money problems can result from insufficient income or lack of
                  clearly defined financial goals, but more often than not,
                  money problems result from poor communication about money.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Differing attitudes and values toward
                  spending and saving money and unrealistic financial goals may
                  result in conflict. When family members don’t talk things
                  out, the conflict may intensify and result in poor financial
                  decisions.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Communicating about money isn’t easy,
                  but it is important if you want to get the most satisfaction
                  from financial resources. The more open communication is about
                  finances, the better the quality of financial decisions.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When talking about money, be honest and
                  candid. Arrange a specific time and place where the family can
                  talk about money without interruption. Meet regularly instead
                  of waiting for a problem to occur.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When talking about money, recognize that
                  whoever earns the money doesn’t also earn the right to
                  dictate how it should be spent. Financial decisions should be
                  made as a team. Allow everyone to have input in financial
                  decisions.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Clearly identify the issue at hand. Is
                  the problem one of spending too much money, spending it at the
                  wrong time, or spending it on something you consider
                  unnecessary or unimportant?</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Let each family member freely state his
                  or her wants, needs, and personal feelings. Avoid judging or
                  criticizing others. Encourage communication by beginning
                  statements with &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I feel.&quot;
                  Avoid the phrases &quot;you always&quot; and &quot;you
                  never.&quot;</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Listen carefully to others. Try to
                  understand their position. Be willing to negotiate and
                  compromise in reaching a settlement of differences.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Communicating about money isn’t easy,
                  but neither is living with financial conflicts. Make a
                  positive change today.</font></p>
