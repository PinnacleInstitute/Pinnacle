                  <h3><font face="Arial">Introduction</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Jackie grew up in a family with very
                  little money. Her parents did not own their home, and there
                  was always a sense of insecurity about having enough money to
                  keep a roof over their heads and cover the family’s basic
                  needs. Because Jackie grew up with this financial insecurity,
                  she has a savings account that will take care of her living
                  expenses for three months and she gets very nervous every time
                  her checking account has less than $1,000 in it. She always
                  worries that she will run short of money even though it has
                  never happened.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Jackie’s fiance, Jessie, grew up in a
                  middle-class family and the children never really thought
                  about money. The family lived in a suburban neighborhood and
                  his parents still live in the house where he grew up. If
                  Jessie’s parents had concerns about finances, Jessie never
                  knew about it. Jessie spends very little time thinking about
                  money. He knows he makes a salary that allows him to do what
                  he wants to do. He has little money set aside for emergencies
                  but generally does not feel a need to think about such things.
                  Jessie’s attitude is, &quot;Why worry about such things
                  until they happen.&quot; As you can imagine, these two
                  individuals have very different views about financial security
                  because of their family life growing up. As Jackie and Jessie
                  enter into marriage, they will have very different ideas about
                  how they should manage their finances as a result of their
                  emotional history with money.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When Wesley finished college and got his
                  first professional position, he immediately opened several
                  credit card accounts so he could purchase nice furniture for
                  his apartment. In addition, he bought a new car with an
                  installment loan. He felt these purchases were necessary
                  considering the entertaining he would need to do with his job.
                  He soon found he could barely make his monthly payments and
                  eventually went to a financial consultant for advice. It took
                  five years to feel he was in control of his finances. This was
                  such a painful experience, he promised himself he would never
                  get financially over-extended again.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Wesley’s girlfriend, Connie, has just
                  finished college and has a great job. She wants to enjoy her
                  newfound financial freedom and wants to finally have some nice
                  things. She is sick of &quot;college&quot; poverty. She wants
                  to buy a new car and get rid of the &quot;junker&quot; she has
                  been driving all through college—the car that regularly
                  stalls at stop signs and has to be towed. Since she and Wesley
                  have talked about getting married in a few years, she also
                  wants to buy a house and furnish it so they will have a nice
                  place to live when they get married. She will need to buy
                  things on credit, because although she has a great job, she
                  has no savings or cash reserve with which to purchase the
                  furniture and other household items.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Wesley and Connie also have differing
                  emotional histories when it comes to money. Wesley has learned
                  from a painful experience as an adult to be very careful in
                  using credit. Connie, on the other hand, has not had this
                  experience. If they decide to get married, they will likely
                  have very different ideas about how to use credit.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Background Information</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Individuals go into marriage with
                  values, attitudes, and behaviors that are unique to them based
                  upon their life experiences. These life experiences can come
                  from differing ethnic cultures, religious cultures,
                  socioeconomic backgrounds, and choices that have been made
                  along the way. We sometimes go into a marriage relationship
                  assuming that everyone thinks the same when it comes to how we
                  want to do things in marriage. Just as with other aspects of
                  married life such as communication patterns, ideas about how
                  to spend leisure time, and gender roles, family finances also
                  have a history that impacts how we expect to do things in the
                  future. Individuals rarely consider how emotional history with
                  money affects their behavior. After all, money and finances
                  have nothing to do with emotions and feelings.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If we think about concepts that have to
                  do with money, we may be surprised to realize that the
                  concepts evoke emotions that are rooted in our life
                  experiences. Below are some concepts related to money and
                  financial management. As you think about the phrases, stop to
                  consider what feelings or emotions go with them.</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Winning the lottery</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Your home being in an earthquake</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Budgeting</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Having no reserve for a financial
                      emergency</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Receiving an inheritance</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Investing in the stock market</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Husbands managing the money</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Wives managing the money</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Life insurance</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Health insurance</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Having $30,000 in school loans</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you reflect on the emotional history
                  that goes with the above concepts, you realize they are not
                  neutral. For example, for one person, life insurance may evoke
                  feelings of security in knowing that your children who are the
                  beneficiaries will be cared for after you are gone. For
                  another person, life insurance may evoke feelings of money
                  wasted on insurance premiums because in their family, the
                  recipients of the life insurance &quot;blew it&quot; on
                  material things that were gone within a couple of years.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Having $30,000 in school loans may
                  create a sense of panic for one person who sees the years of
                  indebtedness ahead because of past experiences with debt.
                  Another person may feel very secure in knowing that $30,000 in
                  school loans is an investment in the future because of
                  increased earnings. Both of the above examples evoke emotions
                  and these emotions are likely to be a result of a person’s
                  life experiences.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It is important to talk about this
                  emotional history with money before marriage. Money is often a
                  topic we do not want to talk about because we think it will
                  take away from the romance of the relationship. Because people
                  have typically not had experience talking about money as a
                  couple, talking about our emotional history is a good way to
                  begin this discussion. Here are some things to keep in mind as
                  you begin to discuss money. These guidelines might be used as
                  you complete the exercises following this section:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Carefully choose a time and place to
                      begin your discussion about money. Being relaxed and
                      without interruptions will allow each person to express
                      his or her thoughts and will allow each person to more
                      readily listen to what his or her partner has to say.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Allow enough time for each person to
                      say what he or she wants to say.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Listen to each other without
                      interruption or voicing judgment about what has been said.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Let your partner know that you heard
                      what he or she said by stating what you heard. For
                      example, you might say, &quot;What I hear you saying
                      is….&quot;</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Remember that when we share emotions,
                      we are usually letting the other person know our areas of
                      vulnerability. Do not misuse that trust by using what the
                      person shared to hurt.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Exercises</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The best way to understand our own
                  emotional history is to think about past experiences. We can
                  start with our life as it was when we were growing up and
                  continue until the present.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Activity 1:</strong>
                  Individually sit down in a quiet place with paper and pencil.
                  Begin by thinking about your first memories of money while you
                  were growing up. Write down some of the events that happened.
                  Try to list at least 10 things. To get started, you might
                  include receiving an allowance, a parent being laid off, or
                  how you spent money as a child. Continue to think about your
                  experiences through your teen years such as having money for
                  recreation or getting your first job. When you have completed
                  this list, go back and identify the emotions that went with
                  each event. Then think about how those events affect your
                  emotions and actions today. Continue this exercise by thinking
                  about adulthood to the present day. You have just completed an
                  assessment of many of the emotions you have today regarding
                  money.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Activity 2:</strong> Use the
                  above list and share your findings with your partner. It is
                  important to be respectful and listen to the other person
                  without interrupting or making judgments. Use the guidelines
                  described above to make this a positive communication
                  experience. Identifying and describing feelings can be
                  difficult and emotionally draining. In fact, this exercise can
                  bring up painful experiences that are difficult to think about
                  and even more difficult to share. Disclosing such personal
                  feelings makes us feel fragile and vulnerable. Treat such
                  disclosures respectfully and do not use this information as a
                  weapon against that person now or in the future.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Activity 3:</strong>
                  Individually think about the list you developed and ask
                  yourself, “How did the events identified and the emotions
                  that go with these events affect my current financial
                  actions?” In other words, how has my emotional history
                  affected my current behaviors? Write down your responses.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Activity 4:</strong> Set aside
                  time to share your personal findings with your partner. Again,
                  as a listener do not interrupt or make judgments about your
                  partner’s findings. Finally, share ways these findings might
                  result in conflict.</font></p>
