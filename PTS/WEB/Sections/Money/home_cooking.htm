                  example, if your family enjoys spaghetti, take one day and
                  cook the expected amount of sauce you might use over a
                  one-month period, then freeze it in appropriate serving sizes.
                  This will make coming home from a long day and preparing
                  dinner much easier. Hamburger can also be browned and frozen
                  in serving sizes. When you are cooking with hamburger, just
                  pull out the necessary size and add it to your dish.</font>

                  purchase savings are more than travel costs, or shop at a
                  store that will match competitor prices.</font></p>
