                  <font face="Arial">Using a credit card changes your spending
                  power. The greatest disadvantage of credit use is losing
                  financial flexibility in managing today’s money. For
                  example, if your credit debt takes 10 percent or more of your
                  after-tax income, you can’t spend those dollars for
                  something else. Credit cards can reduce your future buying
                  power if you carry a balance and let finance charges build up.</font>

                  <p><font face="Arial">How can you get rid of your credit card
                  debt? First, gather all your credit card bills together. For
                  each account, write down the total balance and the minimum
                  monthly payment required. The table below is an example.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial">Then look at your debts and set
                  priorities for your repayments. Which debt will you pay first?
                  Choose strategies from those discussed. Once you have a plan,
                  you are on your way to reducing your debt.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Prioritize Repayments</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Credit card companies require a minimum
                  payment each month. The next step in reducing credit debt is
                  to be sure you can make the minimum payments on your credit
                  cards. Look at your spending and see if you need to make cuts
                  to find the money to pay your credit card bills.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">If you pay only the minimum payment
                  required each month, it can take a very long time to clear
                  your balance. For example, if you have a $3,000 balance at
                  18.9 percent interest and you pay $50.00 toward the balance
                  each month (a typical minimum payment), it will take you 15
                  years and 6 months to pay off your debt, and it would cost you
                  $6,279.85 in interest charges.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Plan to do more than just pay the
                  minimum. In the example above, if you paid $60 each month
                  instead of $50, it would take you 8 years and 4 months to pay
                  off your $3,000 and cost you $2,947 in interest charges.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Choose strategies to cut your debts as
                  soon as possible:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Pay high-rate cards first.</strong>
                      At higher interest rates, more of your monthly payments go
                      toward finance charges. Quickly paying off balances on
                      your credit cards with high rates can free up cash to pay
                      other bills.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Pay off cards with the
                      smallest balances first.</strong> Paying off cards with
                      small balances gives you extra money to pay on the bigger
                      balances.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Make PowerPayments.</strong>
                      Once you pay off a bill, next month add the amount
                      you’ve been paying to the check you write to your
                      remaining creditors. For example, let’s say you pay $30
                      a month to Sears. Once it is paid off, you add $30 more to
                      the check you write for your VISA account. Then when
                      you’ve paid off VISA, add that amount, including the $30
                      from the Sears account, to the check you write to pay your
                      MasterCard amount, and so on until all the accounts are
                      paid in full. The PowerPay computer program calculates the
                      savings made when you make PowerPayments in three
                      scenarios: 1) paying off creditors with the highest
                      interest rates first, 2) paying off creditors with the
                      lowest balances first, and 3) paying off creditors with
                      the shortest terms first. PowerPay can also customize
                      repayment schedules or add an additional amount should
                      extra money become available.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Stop making new charges.</strong>
                      If you have to, have a &quot;plastic surgery party&quot;
                      and cut up all your cards, hide them, or lock them in a
                      drawer.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Stay flexible.</strong> The
                      key to sticking to your debt repayment plan is to stay
                      flexible. If you find that you set unrealistic spending
                      limits in the beginning, revise your spending plan the
                      next month.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Get a cheaper credit card.</strong>
                      Find one or two low-rate cards and cancel all the others.
                      Switching from a high-rate credit card to a low-rate card
                      can easily save you $200 or more a year.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It isn’t easy to reduce credit debt
                  and meet all your other obligations at the same time. Just
                  remember, you eat an elephant one bite at a time.</font></p>
