                  <font face="Arial">&quot;If you will live now like most people
                  won't, you can live the rest of your lives like most people
                  can't.&quot; – Unknown</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Building up savings can be hard but is
                  definitely worth the time and discipline. Can you imagine not
                  having to worry as much when emergencies hit, or not needing
                  to put gifts on your charge card? Through careful planning you
                  can avoid pitfalls.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Three Types of Savings</font></h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Revolving:</strong> This
                      savings is designated for expenses that occur throughout
                      the year, but not every month, for example car insurance,
                      oil changes, taxes, tuition, birthday, and Christmas
                      gifts. Make a list of expenses that you will face this
                      coming year, their expected cost, and the month in which
                      they will occur. Add the expenses together and divide by
                      12. This will give you a figure to save each month. As the
                      expenses occur, use the revolving savings to pay for them.
                      It will take a year to build up this savings account. If
                      you can put a little extra in each month it will help you
                      to meet this year’s expenses and prepare for next year.
                      If it is too difficult to put that much away in a
                      revolving savings account, then take your time. It might
                      take 2 years to build up the account but a little money
                      saved over a long period of time is better than no money
                      saved at all!</font></li>
                    <p><font face="Arial">It has been recommended that each
                    household have 3 – 6 months of income in a savings
                    account. This will help your family avoid getting into debt
                    should there be a loss of income.</font></p>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Emergency:</strong> It is
                      important to have money set aside for emergencies. You
                      cannot always tell when you will get sick, injured, or
                      even lose your job. This type of savings account can be
                      set up at a bank or credit union. Emergency savings must
                      be liquid (ability to access the cash whenever needed with
                      minimal or no consequence).</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Long Term or Investing:</strong>
                      Long term savings would be for college, retirement, or a
                      wedding. This account could be set up in a number ways
                      through banks, credit unions, certificates of deposit, or
                      a number of investment engines (explained below). This
                      type of savings is usually accumulated over a period of
                      time and does not need to be liquid.</font></li>
                  </ol>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Getting Started</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">It may seem overwhelming at first to
                  think that you need an emergency savings: 3 – 6 months of
                  income set aside . . . but choose a type of savings and get
                  started. You do not have to build up each savings account all
                  at once. The important thing is to start, and then make it a
                  habit. Here are some tips to help get you started:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Pay yourself first.</strong>
                      Designate a percent of your paycheck to be put into
                      savings before you even get the chance to spend it. You
                      can have it directly withdrawn from your check and put
                      into a savings account at your bank or credit union. This
                      doesn’t have to be a large percentage, just what you can
                      afford. As your income increases you can leave this
                      percentage the same or increase it as well. It is hard to
                      miss money you do not see! If you might feel tempted to
                      spend the money you are saving, consider putting it in a
                      bank or credit union that is across town. That way you
                      will have time to think about the purchase while you are
                      driving to that bank or credit union to make the
                      withdrawal.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Use paper money for all
                      purchases.</strong> Take the change from each purchase and
                      deposit it into a savings account once a month or save it
                      in a jar for a special occasion or emergency cash.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Step Down Principle.</strong>
                      The Step Down Principle will allow you to save money on
                      the things you do every day, by stepping down from more
                      expensive spending to less expensive spending. For
                      example, going to an evening showing at the movie theater
                      might cost $15 per person for a ticket, drink, and
                      popcorn. One step down from the evening showing would be a
                      matinee, a step down from this might be renting a movie,
                      another step down could be checking out films from the
                      library. The Step Down Principle can be applied to just
                      about everything—eating out, buying clothing,
                      entertainment, dating, even things like car insurance, and
                      amenities in your home. Any money saved from using the
                      Step Down Principle could be put into savings.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Prior to Investing</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Before making the decision to invest,
                  have a working budget and a savings plan for emergencies. It
                  will not benefit you to have money tied up in an investment if
                  you are living paycheck to paycheck or if an emergency
                  strikes. Control your debt. Hold off on investing if you have
                  pressing debts, use the principles discussed above to reduce
                  or eliminate your debts. It is also important to carry
                  appropriate insurance. Make sure you are covered on health and
                  auto. You may want to consider life insurance if you have any
                  dependents; this will aid them in the event of your death. If
                  necessary, liability insurance will protect you in case you
                  are ever sued. This would cover your assets as well as your
                  lifestyle. Doing these things will help you be in a better
                  position to start investing.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Basics of Investing</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Time.</strong> Once you feel
                  ready to invest, the first step is to set goals. Where do you
                  see yourself in 5 years, 10 years, 50 years? Your goals will
                  determine which type of investing is right for you.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Age. </strong>Younger
                  individuals can afford to take more risks with their
                  investments, they have a longer time to invest, making and
                  losing money along the way. Older individuals who might be
                  closer to retirement may not want to be as risky with their
                  money.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Diversify.</strong>&quot;Don’t
                  put your eggs all in one basket!&quot; This is one way to
                  think of diversification. It is not wise to put all of your
                  money into one type of investment, or into only one company.
                  After researching the different types of investments, take
                  into consideration your goals and make a decision on how to
                  diversify your investments. For example you might have two
                  mutual funds, an IRA, and two CDs.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Compounding Interest.</strong>
                  You not only earn interest on your initial amount invested,
                  but also on the interest you have earned so far.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Time value of money.</strong>
                  The earlier you invest your money the more you will make. Time
                  and interest combined will help you to earn more than if you
                  waited and invested more money at a later date. Compounding
                  interest makes this possible.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Dollar Cost Averaging.</strong>
                  This will help you avoid the common mistake of buying high and
                  selling low. Invest equal amounts of money on a regular basis
                  no matter what the price of the investment. This will allow
                  you to buy more shares when the price per share is down and
                  less when the price per share is high.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">The Rule of 72</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To find out how long it will take an
                  investment to double, simply divide the interest rate into 72.
                  If you have an investment growing at 8% interest it will take
                  you 9 years to double your investment. This calculation works
                  for any dollar amount being invested.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Keeping risk levels and your age in
                  mind, visit with your bank or local investment agency about
                  getting started with an investment. It is important to choose
                  an investment agency that you feel comfortable with and agree
                  to their terms and conditions.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Types of Investments: Low Risk and High
                  Risk</font></h3>
                  <h4><font face="Arial">Lower Risk Investments</font></h4>
                  <p><font face="Arial">These do not have the potential to
                  produce rates of return (or earnings) as great as other higher
                  risk investments. However, earnings are guaranteed and in many
                  cases they are also insured.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Bonds.</strong> Bonds are
                  purchased from corporations, city or state, and federal
                  governments on the agreement that they will reimburse your
                  money with some interest after a designated period of time.
                  For example, you might purchase a five year bond for $1000
                  with a 5% interest rate from your local government. For five
                  years the government will use your initial $1000 for a
                  specific project, but pay you 5% per year for that use. When
                  the bond matures at the end of the 5 years you will receive
                  the initial amount of $1000 and the total interest. Some
                  organizations pay the interest yearly, others pay the interest
                  in one lump sum at the mature date.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">There are different levels of risk with
                  corporate and government bonds that may have a high risk
                  level. For example, there may be the risk of a new corporation
                  going under, thus not being able to repay the initial amount
                  of the bond to you, the investor. (Savings bonds are low risk
                  and corporate or junk bonds are higher risk. Talk to an
                  investment agency of your choice about which would be best for
                  you.)</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Certificate of Deposit (CD).</strong>
                  These are similar to bonds, but can offer a little higher
                  interest rate depending on the length of the CD. CD’s
                  require that you invest your money for a particular period of
                  time, for example, 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years. There are
                  penalties for withdrawing your money before the due date.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Money Market Account.</strong>
                  This type of account typically offers a higher interest rate
                  than a regular savings account. You can write a limited number
                  of checks from this account without receiving a penalty, for
                  example, 15 checks per year. Typically there is a minimum
                  amount required to be in the account at all times, for
                  example, $1000. This amount is usually higher than a savings
                  account minimum.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Higher Risk Investments.</strong>
                  These rates of return (or earnings) will be higher, but they
                  are not guaranteed. Any statement of how well the investment
                  will do is typically based on past performance and cannot
                  always accurately portray how the investment will do in the
                  future.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Mutual Fund.</strong> This type
                  of investing has a higher interest rate—8%, 10% or even
                  higher. Usually the higher the interest rate, the higher the
                  risk. A mutual fund consists of a number of different stocks
                  (diversification) that are managed by a professional who makes
                  the decisions of when to buy and sell the stock. There are
                  fees required because someone is managing the fund. Since the
                  funds are diversified, one stock within your fund might lose
                  money one month and another stock might earn money. Allow time
                  for the money to grow (compounding interest) by keeping the
                  mutual fund for a period of time (5, 10, 20 years, depending
                  on your investment goals) and you will increase your chances
                  of making money. Remember, mutual funds contain stocks; you
                  may have periods of time when you lose money as well as other
                  periods when you earn money.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Mutual Fund Fees. </strong>Mutual
                  funds are known as load and no-load funds. A load fund has two
                  different types, front-end load and back-end load. A front-end
                  load means that a fee will be charged every time a share is
                  purchased. Back-end load means that a fee will be charged
                  every time a share is sold. A no-load fund indicates no
                  managing fees, but this also means no manager. You would be
                  responsible for watching the stock within the fund, and would
                  work directly with the investment company to buy and sell the
                  stocks. There may also be annual fees with a no-load fund.
                  Another fee, referred to as the 12b-1 fee, is specifically for
                  promotional costs such as advertising and marketing.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Individual Stocks. </strong>Owning
                  stock means owning a portion of a company. As an owner of
                  stock you can buy and sell it as you wish. The value of stock
                  is determined by three main factors: how well the company is
                  doing, the economy, and each investor’s perception of how
                  well the company will do. There are two ways to make money
                  with stocks: first, selling shares once they have increased in
                  value, and second, reinvesting dividends. A dividend is part
                  of a company’s earnings that are paid to the owners of the
                  stock. Some companies reward their stockholders with a high
                  percentage of their dividends. Other companies may not even
                  offer dividends; they will reinvest their dividends back into
                  the company hoping to make more money. Stockholders can also
                  reinvest any dividends they may earn. Companies as well as
                  stockholders who reinvest their dividends usually grow faster.</font></p>

                  tax benefits. For example, the earnings could grow tax free if

                  <h3><font face="Arial">Specific Retirement Investments</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Individual Retirement Account (IRA) –
                  An IRA is a way to save for retirement. An IRA is not a direct
                  investment, but within an IRA you can invest in things like
                  stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. There are yearly maximum
                  amounts you can contribute to an IRA. The amount will be
                  $4,000 for 2005 – 2007 and in 2008 the amount will increase
                  to $5,000. This amount may be limited for those with a high
                  income or those who take part in a 401K. There are two types
                  of IRAs, Traditional and Roth.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Traditional IRA:</strong> A
                  Traditional IRA allows you to invest money before taxes, but
                  when you withdraw the money you will be required to pay income
                  taxes. Any money withdrawn before age 50½ will be subject to
                  a 10% penalty. At age 70½ you will be required to start
                  withdrawing a minimum amount from the IRA.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Roth IRA:</strong> A Roth IRA
                  allows you to invest money after taxes. Withdrawals are tax
                  free, however, there will be a 10% penalty for withdrawals
                  before age 50½ . If you have had the account for 5 years
                  money may be withdrawn without a penalty if used for a down
                  payment or education. If you are not close to retirement, a
                  Roth IRA will give you a better tax benefit because all the
                  earnings will be tax free.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial"><strong>401(k):</strong> This is the
                  best known employee sponsored retirement plan. Employees can
                  contribute up to 100% of their gross income up to $40,000 a
                  year. This is a tax sheltered plan. This means that the money
                  you contribute to the account is not taxed, but it will be
                  when the money is withdrawn. Employees can choose from a
                  variety of investment options that will make up their 401(k).
                  There are different types of employee retirement plans. For
                  example: the 403(b) is a plan for nonprofit organizations.
                  Make an appointment to talk with your employer to find out
                  more about your specific options.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial">It is important to prepare for
                  retirement. Social Security and employer retirement plans may
                  not be enough. Most individuals will need to invest in order
                  to have enough money in retirement. The following chart gives
                  an example of a current retiree and what they might expect.</font></p>
