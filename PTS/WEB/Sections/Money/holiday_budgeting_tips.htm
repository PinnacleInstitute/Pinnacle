                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">Wise men and women plan before making
                  holiday purchases. To avoid overspending, consider these tips:</font>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial">If it is necessary to cut back on
                      spending this year, communicate that with your family. It
                      doesn't mean the holidays have to change dramatically.
                      Families should discuss what is important to them this
                      season and be willing to make changes if necessary.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Set a holiday budget and keep track
                      of what you spend. Include all expenditures—not just the
                      cost of gifts. Figure costs of food, entertainment,
                      decorations, travel expenses, holiday cards and postage as
                      well as the cost of new clothes for the season. If
                      possible, look at how much you spent last year to help set
                      your budget.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Set spending limits for each person
                      on your list as well as for the other items in your
                      holiday plan. Write your limit on an envelope and keep it
                      handy. When you make a purchase, subtract the amount from
                      the limit and place the receipt in the envelope.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Decide how you are going to pay for
                      holiday spending. If you plan to use only cash, leave your
                      credit cards at home when shopping. If you write checks,
                      record each check in your register and figure the balance
                      before writing another check. This will help you stay
                      within your limit.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">If you need or want to use a credit
                      card, choose one to use for all your holiday spending. You
                      can control your spending on one card much more easily
                      than on three or four cards. Check your latest statement
                      for each card to determine the annual interest rate. Use
                      the one with the lowest rate. Only charge what you can
                      afford to pay off each month. Pay close attention to your
                      credit limit and understand the charge card guidelines.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Avoid impulse shopping. Start
                      shopping far enough in advance that you will not be
                      pressured to buy the first item you see in the store or
                      catalog. This allows you to compare similar items and take
                      advantage of sales.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Talk with family and friends about
                      drawing names for a gift exchange, setting dollar limits
                      on gifts or not exchanging gifts among adults. Make gifts
                      by hand or give gift certificates promising your time or
                      talents. Offer gifts for such things as babysitting, car
                      washing or a particular talent, such as photography. Give
                      family keepsakes or pictures as gifts to create memories
                      as well.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">If entertaining family and friends
                      consumes a large part of your holiday budget, consider
                      pitch-in dinners instead of shouldering all the work and
                      expense yourself. You could also invite people for dessert
                      and coffee or a small luncheon, brunch or breakfast.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial">Though this holiday season is already
                      underway, it is not too early to start planning for next
                      year. Think ahead and take advantage of after-holiday
                      sales. Good budgeting should take place all year long, not
                      just at the holidays.</font></li>
