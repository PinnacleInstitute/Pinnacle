                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">If you received a $500 bonus, what would
                  you do with it? Pay off bills? Buy clothes? Buy a new DVD? Put
                  it in a savings account? Make a down payment on a motorcycle?</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">How you spend your money depends on how
                  you feel about money. Some people see money as power. To
                  others it represents status and prestige. To some it means
                  security. Some people use money to get the things they want in
                  life. Others just want enough to pay for the day-to-day needs.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Understanding how you and other family
                  members feel about money can help you deal with and find
                  solutions to financial differences. According to the
                  categories below, which type of money spender are you?</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>TYPE I:</strong> I spend only
                      for what I need. I save for emergencies. I like to have
                      money in my pocket. I shop around for the best deal.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>TYPE II:</strong> I want
                      nothing but the best! You’ve got to spend money to get
                      ahead in life. Expensive clothes are important to me.
                      Cheap stuff isn’t worth much.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>TYPE III:</strong> It seems
                      like no one ever has enough money. Credit is necessary. I
                      deserve the best things in life and I like to buy the
                      things I want, NOW.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>TYPE IV:</strong> I think
                      other things are more important than money. Money can’t
                      buy happiness. Children should learn not to put a dollar
                      value on everything. You can have fun without spending
                      money.</font></li>
                    <li><font face="Arial"><strong>TYPE V:</strong> Worrying
                      about money never helps. The money will come from
                      somewhere. Keeping track of spending can drive people
                      crazy. A person can get along without saving.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Maybe you recognize yourself and other
                  family members in one or more of these descriptions. The
                  priorities, attitudes, and behaviors of each are quite
                  different and often lead to conflict. Remember, none of the
                  types are right or wrong, they are just different.
                  Understanding and talking about the differences is the key to
                  dealing with and solving financial conflicts.</font></p>
