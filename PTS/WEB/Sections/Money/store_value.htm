                  <font face="Arial">The selling points of prepaid debit cards
                  are powerful. Proponents say the cards are convenient and
                  safer to carry than cash. They are easy to obtain because
                  there is no credit check, no bank account required and no
                  verification of employment. Consumers are told the cards can
                  save money, help budget, manage finances, help avoid debt and
                  even establish credit. They are told that prepaid debit cards
                  can help control spending, since consumers put the amount on
                  the card they would like to spend. Could this be the answer
                  for helping Utahns stay away from debt?</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Not likely. In fact, when looking at the
                  terms of use closely, there is cause for concern. Consider
                  this information:</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How do Stored Value Cards Work?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">These cards are marketed as prepaid
                  debit cards or stored value cards (SVCs). Magnetic strip
                  technology stores information about money that has been
                  prepaid to the card. The first prepaid cards to hit the market
                  were single-purpose cards used to purchase goods at specific
                  retailers, such as prepaid telephone cards and cards used for
                  public transportation. Copy centers offer them for use with
                  copy machines.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Department stores issue them as gift
                  cards. Students using prepaid university cards can navigate
                  campus without a dime in their pockets using the cards in the
                  cafeteria, the bookstore, the library and even at soda
                  machines. These single-purpose cards are convenient, simple
                  and there is no fee to the buyer or user. If you buy a $50
                  telephone card, you can make $50 worth of phone calls.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">More recently, however, cards have
                  emerged with multi-purpose usage. These cards can receive
                  direct deposits and can then be used to make cash withdrawals
                  at ATMs. They can be used for retail purchases, to pay bills
                  and to make money transfers. In fact, if branded with a
                  bankcard name, they can be used everywhere the issuing
                  bankcards are accepted. According to industry estimates,
                  roughly 7 million Visa or MasterCard branded SVCs are in the
                  marketplace. Experts say this industry is in the early growth
                  stage with substantial growth potential in the years ahead.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">How Can Consumers Lose?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Consumers need to know that
                  multi-purpose SVCs are often laden with excessive fees.
                  Usually there are no fees to put money onto the card or to
                  check your balance on-line. The fees start when you want to
                  use your money. There is a one-time activation or set-up fee,
                  which can range from $5.95 to $140. Annual and monthly
                  maintenance fees can range from nothing (if you keep a minimum
                  balance or bring 10 or more referrals to the card program) to
                  $99.95. A convenience fee is charged to each purchase, ranging
                  from $1 to $2. To get cash from an ATM can cost $1.50 to
                  $3.75. Checking your balance at an ATM may cost $1. To speak
                  with a customer service representative will also cost $1.
                  There are fees for additional cards, lost or stolen
                  replacement cards, returned checks and overdrafts. Consider
                  how easy it would be to lose track of the amount on the card,
                  then have to pay an overdraft fee of $29.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Other potential charges to watch for
                  include transaction limit fees, bill payment fees, phone or
                  online transaction fees, reload fees, money transfer fees,
                  out-of-network domestic ATM transaction fees, international
                  ATM transaction fees, inactivity fees, overdraft protection
                  fees, payday advance fees, credit-reporting fees and dispute
                  fees.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Additionally, consumers need to be aware
                  that some financial transactions generate dual fees. You may
                  have stashed your card away for emergencies. If the card is
                  not used for a period of time (i.e., 90 days) you are charged,
                  in addition to your monthly maintenance fee, an inactivity
                  fee. Also, depending on the ATM machine used, the ATM provider
                  may impose charges to your transaction in addition to ATM fees
                  listed by your card carrier.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Multi-purpose SVCs are often confusing
                  and complex. Some impose fees associated with value load or
                  reload. It is unclear what these terms imply and how they
                  differ from adding money via a bank transfer or direct
                  deposit. Also confusing are membership programs available to
                  reduce monthly or yearly fees. These programs depend on
                  referrals. In return, you will earn an ongoing income,
                  depending on the level at which you and your referrals are
                  approved. Then there’s the issue of how points are earned.
                  You worked for this money once, now you may have to work for
                  it again.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">What Else Should Consumers Know about
                  SVCs?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Certain populations are targeted, many
                  of whom are elderly or poor. Many cards advertise that Social
                  Security money can be direct-deposited free of charge. The
                  poor are targeted with ads stating that their cards will help
                  build credit. Those who don’t like traditional banking are
                  told they don’t need a bank account or employment
                  verification to have a card. These cards may be increasingly
                  offered at check-cashing outlets.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Are These Cards Legal?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Yes. Fees are not regulated by the
                  federal government. As long as the company issuing the card
                  discloses the fees, it has fulfilled its legal obligation.
                  Also, most SVCs fall outside the realm of traditional banking
                  so they are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance
                  Corporation (FDIC) regulations. This means cardholders’
                  funds are not protected if the bank fails. Consumers may also
                  be out of luck if the card is lost or stolen.</font></p>
                  <h3><font face="Arial">Why are Consumers Using These Cards?</font></h3>
                  <p><font face="Arial">The cards may suit some consumers for
                  several reasons. First, they are convenient. Second, if a
                  consumer cannot qualify for traditional credit cards, they are
                  an alternative. If used properly, the cards can help build a
                  good credit rating. Third, SVCs are useful for small purchases
                  online because they can be convenient and can offer anonymity.
                  Finally, some cards offer benefits such as car insurance.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Consumers should ask how much the
                  convenience of the cards is worth to them. They should
                  carefully examine the terms of use and compare these cards
                  with traditional banking cards offering similar benefits and
                  services. For those who have no or poor credit, most banks
                  offer secured cards with lower fees.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Stored value cards are becoming
                  increasingly popular. However, the next time you see an ad
                  stating they are just like a credit card without the debt,
                  remember to be cautious and do your homework before signing
                  up. You shouldn’t have to pay to use your own money.</font></p>
