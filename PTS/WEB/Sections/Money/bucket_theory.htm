                Management</font>
				</p>
                <div id="results">
                  <font face="Arial">To become financially worry-free is not an
                  impossible goal. Through a common sense approach, you can
                  achieve this aspiration by working at it systematically.
                  Imagine five buckets hanging in stair step fashion, each below
                  and a little to the right of the one above it. As water flows
                  into the top bucket the bucket begins to fill. When it reaches
                  its capacity, the water flows over the edge and into the
                  second bucket. This process continues until all the buckets
                  are filled.</font>
                  <p><font face="Arial">Imagine that each bucket represents one
                  of the basic financial priorities. The first bucket represents
                  basic needs; food, shelter, clothing, and transportation. The
                  second bucket represents financial security and includes an
                  emergency fund and savings plan. The third bucket represents a
                  family’s insurance needs, including life, health, and
                  property protection. The fourth bucket represents quality of
                  life. The fifth bucket represents investments. The water that
                  flows from bucket to bucket represents the resources a family
                  has.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">To build a sound financial base for a
                  family, each bucket must be filled before resources are
                  diverted to the next one. First resources are used to provide
                  basic needs. As income increases and money is left after basic
                  needs are met, the extra is used to develop an emergency fund
                  and begin a regular savings plan. When saving is regular
                  (ideally 10 percent of income) and the emergency fund complete
                  (containing 3-12 months’ salary), the next step is to
                  purchase adequate insurance to protect the family’s health,
                  income, and property.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">When adequate insurance coverage is
                  provided, extra money is then diverted to building quality of
                  life. Quality of life focuses on acquiring some of the wants,
                  extras, and frills. The last step is to channel the extra
                  money available into investments that will provide a secure
                  future for the family. This might include money for
                  children’s education, retirement, or family goals.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial">This &quot;bucket theory&quot; of
                  financial management is a common sense approach to planning a
                  family’s financial future. It provides a systematic way for
                  families to set and reach financial goals and it helps the
                  family build a sound financial foundation.</font></p>
