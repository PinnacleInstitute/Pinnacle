<BR>
<BR>This is an important question to ask yourself when designing a lead program.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>First you need to know what type of leads you want to generate.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Are you out to acquire customers? </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Are you out to acquire reps or distributors? </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can easily do both with a well designed lead capture page but these pages perform much better and will produce a higher quality of lead if you really narrow down your target market.&nbsp; You may get less lead submissions but the quality of your leads will sky rocket.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Another important question to ask yourself when&nbsp;building a lead program is what questions you want to "pre-qualify" your leads with.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The common 4 questions to ask your leads are:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><DIV align=left><FONT size=3>Name </FONT></DIV>
<LI><DIV align=left><FONT size=3>Email </FONT></DIV>
<LI><DIV align=left><FONT size=3>Phone </FONT></DIV>
<LI><DIV align=left><FONT size=3>Best Time To Call </FONT></DIV>
</UL>
<P><FONT size=3>In addition to these 4 questions there may be a few others you might wish to ask your potential prospects to further enhance the quality of your leads.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>We don't recommend asking your visitors more than 3-4 additional questions.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Here are a few sample questions that we have several clients asking their potential prospects.</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>Have you ever owned a home based business? </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>How much time can you invest in your business? </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Are you interested in our products or opportunity? </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>How much money do want to make monthly? </FONT>
</UL>
<P><FONT size=3>One very important field that you'll want on any Lead Program is a field for your potential prospects to leave their comments or questions.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You will find that many people will leave comments and questions on the form.&nbsp; This will give some very important data as to what they are looking for or who they are.&nbsp; It makes it much easier when talking with the lead if you can address their specific questions or concerns.
