<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals and Entertainment are 50%
deductible when business is discussed in a clear business setting and as long as
it is not lavish or extravagant.&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana" size="3"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">There
are several specific rules to determine if a meal is a legitimate
business expense.&nbsp; These specific rules include meeting the
business purpose requirement and the ordinary<br>and necessary requirement.<br><br>General Rule<br><br>Meals
are generally 50% deductible.&nbsp; This means when a business pays for
a meal, only 50% of that amount is deducted on the tax return.&nbsp;
It's extremely important to know the exceptions to this rule because
some meals are 100% deductible!<br><br>Meals that are 50% deductible include:<br><br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals with clients, customers and vendors.</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals with employees</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals with partners, shareholders and directors</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals during business travel</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals while attending a business seminar or convention</font></li></ul><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><br>Exception to the Rule (This is a great exception!)<br><br>Some meals are 100% deductible!&nbsp;&nbsp; These meals include:<br><br>Meals for the business holiday party or other social event (like the company picnic).<br><br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Office snacks provided to employees at the office. This may include coffee, soda, water, candy, donuts, and similar snacks.</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals
provided on the employer's premises to more than half of the employees
for the convenience of the employer. An example of this is when a
business provides meals to employees in order to keep them working
weekends or working later than usual. This is for the employer's
convenience to keep the employees at the office.</font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Meals
for which the business is reimbursed for the expense. For example, if a
business takes a client to lunch and then bills the client for that
lunch in a separate line item on the invoice, then the business can
fully deduct that meal.</font></li></ul><font face="Verdana" size="3">Ever
wonder why some accountant or attorney invoices show the meals expense
as a separate line item?&nbsp; Because it makes the meal expense fully
deductible&nbsp; to them and makes it 50% deductible to the
client!&nbsp; Be careful if you are on the receiving end of this
invoice!</font><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">If the meal expense is not specifically itemized on the invoice (and just lumped into <br>the service fee), then the meal is only 50% deductible to the business and 100% <br>deductible to the client.<br><br>*Important Tip:&nbsp; When it comes to preparing your tax return, it's easy to forget which <br>meals met the requirements to be 100% deductible.&nbsp; And if your tax preparer has never <br>asked you this it most likely means all of your meals are being subject to the 50% <br>limitation !&nbsp; It's best to capture this information when you actually have the meal.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">For all meal and entertainment expenses you must track who was there, the business purpose, when, where and how much.&nbsp;</font></p><div align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">If meal/entertainment is not in a clear business
          setting, it can still be deductible if it occurs within 24 hrs. of
          conducting business.&nbsp; So you can have fun first, then discuss
          business and receive a full deduction.&nbsp; </font></div>
