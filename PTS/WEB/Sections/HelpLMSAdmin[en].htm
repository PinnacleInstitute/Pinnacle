<P>Why Lead Programs?</FONT> <FONT size=2>
<P>Sadly, too many companies send the click-throughs from promotions to their site's home page. Unless you are offering a single product with a microsite, this can be a big mistake. The average home page doesn't provide a clear path to the product you are advertising, nor is it suited to follow a particular ad, cinch the deal, and bring in the sale. Instead, the average home page provides a half-dozen rabbit trails that your potential customer can explore before she gives up in disgust and impatience. A lead program, on the other hand, is designed to accomplish a specific targeted objective.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=2><B>Lead Program Check List</B> &nbsp;</FONT><FONT size=2> 
<OL>
<LI><FONT size=2>Does the Lead Program finish with a solid MWR?</FONT> 
<LI>Is the opening line a “Big Gun”?&nbsp; Does it transmit the major benefit, the USP, to the prospect? Do the next couple of paragraphs build on that? 
<LI>Scan through each page of the lead program.&nbsp; Is there a logical progression that builds to the MWR?&nbsp; 
<LI>Are all the major benefits covered? Have you enhanced desire by painting word and graphic pictures of the benefits? 
<LI><FONT size=2>Have you helped the prospect create a rationale&nbsp;by describing key distinguishing features?</FONT> 
<LI>Does the MWR Closer Page build an offer that makes the MWR irresistible?&nbsp; Is the offer so good that you’d be afraid to pass it up? 
<LI>Have you offered proof and major credibility-builders?&nbsp; Do you get an overall good, believable solid feel from the page? 
<LI>Have you eliminated the risk (i.e. guarantee, etc.)?&nbsp; Is that clear to the visitor? 
<LI>Is it all bundled in a clear call to action where the visitor is told exactly what to do? 
<LI>Is the visitor reminded of the major benefits again?&nbsp; 
<LI>Is there a strong and logical reason why action is required right now?&nbsp; 
<LI>Does the visitor understand exactly what she gets?&nbsp; Don’t take this for granted. 
<LI>Does the page maintain a “you-oriented” focus throughout the lead program?&nbsp; Have you eliminated all references to I, we, my, our, and us. 
<LI>Read it all out loud to a colleague or spouse.&nbsp; Does anything ring hollow, embarrass you, or just plain doesn’t work? Fix it. 
<LI>Once it is as good as can be, spell-check it.&nbsp; Then proof-read for spelling errors missed by the spell checker. Review it for reasonable grammar. Double-check it if a lot of changes are made.
