<P>SEO is the science of optimizing your web pages for free placement on the search engines.&nbsp; The vast majority of Internet users search for the information they want with the search engines.&nbsp; The majority of all searches are performed on one of the top search engines including; Google, Yahoo, MSN,&nbsp;AOL and a few other smaller ones. Almost all other search websites are powered by one of the top search engines.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The following tips will help you build a Lead Program that can be indexed by the Internet search engines and listed in the top&nbsp;search results for free. After building your Lead Program, you will need to submit it to the search engines and monitor your search engine result listings for your specified keywords.&nbsp; See http://www.mikes-marketing-tools.com/ranking-reports as an example.&nbsp; Contact Customer Support for assistance with other SEO submission and monitoring tools. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>The two most important SEO factors&nbsp;are </B><FONT color=#ff0000><FONT color=#ff0000><B>Topic</B></FONT> (what you say you're about, with great focused content) </FONT><B>and </B><FONT color=#ff0000><B><FONT color=#ff0000>Link Poularity</FONT></B> (what others say you're about, your reputation, with links from other relevent quality webpages)</FONT><B> .</B> &nbsp;</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><B>1. Keywords</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Identify the top 10 keywords that your target market is likely to enter in the search engines.&nbsp;Examine the keywords used by your competitors.&nbsp; Use keyword research tools to find related keywords that you would not have thought of.&nbsp;&nbsp;The keywords can be specified above.&nbsp; See inventory.overture.com as an example.&nbsp;</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><B>2. Single-Topic Content</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Content is king.&nbsp; There is no need to trick the search engines, give them what they want, valuable information.&nbsp; Give them an abundance of great information on one single, very focused topic based on your identified keywords.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><B>3. Link Popularity</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Increase your&nbsp;link popularity by increasing your&nbsp;internal and incoming links. 
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Internal links - Cross link all your pages&nbsp;within each lead program. This will maximize the PageRank of all your pages within each lead program. 
<BR>
<LI>Incoming links that you control - Create several small web sites related to your main site. Each site should only consist of a few pages. Then cross link them all together using the most important keywords. Don't forget to include links back to the main site. 
<BR>
<LI>Ask sites that link to your competitors to link to your site. To find out which sites are linking to your competitors, visit a search engine and enter, "link:" followed by the competitors' domain name. 
<BR>
<BR>For example: <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>link:www.yourcompetitor.com</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Exchange links with sites listed in the same category as yours in the major web directories, such as the <A href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Directory</A> and the <A href="http://dmoz.org/">Open Directory</A>. 
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Find sites that accept site submissions. Visit your favorite search engine and search for: <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>"add url" "your keywords"</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>Also try searching for the actual submission page using its page name. 
<BR>
<BR>For example: <BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>addurl.html, addsite.html, addlink.html, etc</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>4. Title</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Write a descriptive title for each page of 5 to 8 words. Remove as many "filler" words from the title, such as "the," "and," etc. This page title will appear hyperlinked on the search engines when your page is found. Entice surfers to click on the title by making it a bit provocative.&nbsp; Plan to use some descriptive keywords along with your business name on your home page. If you specialize in silver bullets and that's what people will be searching for, don't just use your company name "Acme Ammunition, Inc." use "Silver Bullets - Acme Ammunition, Inc." Words people are most likely to search on put first in the title (called "keyword prominence"). Remember, this title is your entire identity on the search engines. The more people see in the blue highlighted portion of the search engine that interests them, the more likely they are to click on the link. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>5. Description</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Include a&nbsp;description&nbsp;that is displayed&nbsp;by the search engines after the first line title. Include the most important keyword phrase for the web page as close to the beginning of the description as possible. The description can be specified above. This sentence should describe the contents of the body text of the webpage, using the main keywords used on the page. If you include keywords that aren't used on the webpage you could hurt yourself. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>6. Header Tags</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Search engines consider words that appear in the page headline and sub heads to be important to the page, so make sure your desired keywords and phrase appear in one or two header tags. </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>Use one or more header tags in your main page body and include your most important keyword phrase/s. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Use large header tags, such as &lt;H1&gt; and &lt;H2&gt;. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Place the header tags above any tables&nbsp; </FONT>
</UL>
<P><FONT size=3><B>7. First Paragraph</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT size=3>Search engines expect that your first paragraph will contain the important keywords for the document. You don't want to stuff keywords here, however. </FONT>Check the first couple of lines of the first paragraph to see if it's appropriate to be used as a description of your page. Many search engines utilize the first couple of sentences of the body text as the search results description, instead of the contents of the description field. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>8. Keyword Density</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Try to achieve an overall keyword density of 2-4%. Keyword density is the ratio of keywords to other non-noise words.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>9. Domain Name</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Register a domain name with the exact keyword phrase you wish to target, using hyphens or underscores to separate the keywords. Hyphens help separate the keywords for the search engines. 
<BR>
<BR>For example, if the keyword phrase is "search engine rankings," then register: </FONT><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><FONT size=3>search-engine-rankings.com</FONT></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>If the domain you want is unavailable, either try a different extension, such as .NET, .INFO, or .US, or add a keyword to the end (preferential) or beginning of the domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact Customer Support for assistance with purchasing and setting up your domain name. 
<BR>
<BR><B>10. Graphic File Names</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Name your graphic files after keyword phrases. Again, separate the keywords using hyphens or underscores. 
<BR>
<BR>For example: </FONT><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><FONT size=3>&lt;IMG SRC="search-engines-rankings.gif"&gt;</FONT></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>&nbsp;<B>11. ALT Image Tags</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Include an ALT (alternative text) attribute in image tags. Include the most important keyword phrases. 
<BR>
<BR>For example: </FONT><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE><FONT size=3>&lt;IMG SRC="search-engines-rankings.gif" ALT="search engine rankings."&gt;</FONT></CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3><B>12. Longer / Plural Keywords</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Use the longer or plural version of a keyword, where possible. Word stemming is a concept used by some search engines to return search results that include keywords that extend beyond what you searched for. 
<BR>
<BR>For example, a search with the keyword "engine" might return results for, "engines," "engineers," and "engineering." If someone searches for the longer version of a word and your page only uses the short version, then your page will be excluded from the list of possible results. 
<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>13. Sprinkle&nbsp;Other Keywords</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Sprinkle a few uncommon keywords and synonyms in your main body text. Less popular keywords have less competition in the search engines. So your web page has a greater chance of being listed amongst the top results. 
<BR>
<BR><B>14. Font Size / Color</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Do not use font size one (1) text as the default text size. Many search engines consider tiny text to be spam. It's OK to use some font size one text. Do not set the foreground and background color the same.&nbsp; This too is considered spam. 
<BR></FONT><B>
<BR><FONT size=3>15. Link Farms / Exchanges</FONT></B><FONT size=3>&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Do not participate in link farms or link exchange programs. Search engines consider link farms and link exchange programs as spam, as they have only one purpose - to artificially inflate a site's link popularity, by exchanging links with other participants. 
<BR>
<BR>Do not confuse link farms and link exchange programs with reciprocal linking. Reciprocal linking is the exchange of links with individual sites, and is certainly an accepted technique for improving your site's link popularity. </FONT>
