<P><B>Affiliate Compensation Plan</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>The Pinnacle Performance Institute provides compensation to its affiliates for the sales of training memberships. Compensation recurs monthly and grows as the affiliates achieve higher ranks. There are many different types of compensation including retail and override commissions for the sales of training memberships, and executive bonuses and car bonuses for building and managing sales organizations. Affiliates can build sales organizations of any size with no width limitations on the number of personally sponsored affiliates. 
<P>The Pinnacle compensation plan enables affiliates to quickly earn the cost of their monthly membership by achieving the Manager rank. The core of the affiliates, at the Executive rank, can earn monthly payouts of $500+. Sales leaders and dream builders are motivated by the ability to earn $50,000+ monthly. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Retail Commission</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><IMG hspace=10 src="Images\RetailCommission.jpg" align=right> Retail commissions of 5% - 25% are paid monthly to affiliates based on their achieved rank for the sales of training memberships. For example, A Director receives a 20% retail commission.&nbsp; 
<P>Affiliates are not required to purchase the training membership&nbsp;to earn retail commissions. Affiliates are required to purchase&nbsp;the training membership to earn all other commissions and bonuses. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Rank Promotion</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><IMG hspace=10 src="Images\Rank.jpg" align=right> Affiliates are promoted to higher ranks by building their monthly group sales volume. For example; if an affiliate achieves a monthly group sales volume of $600, she will be promoted to the rank of Manager and will be entitled to all Manager compensation. Group volume includes all sales down to an Executive. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Override Commission</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>Override commissions are paid to upline affiliates based on the difference between the rank of the affiliate and the rank of the upline affiliate. For example, if an Associate makes a sale and his sponsor is an Executive, the Executive will receive a 20% override commission on the sale. Affiliates must have at least $50 in personal sales to qualify for Override Commissions.

<P><B>Manager Bonus</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>Managers with three active personally sponsored affiliates will receive a cash bonus to insure that the&nbsp;cost of their monthly training membership is covered.&nbsp;<FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2></FONT><FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Executive Rank</B></FONT>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2><IMG hspace=10 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com//Images/execrank.jpg" align=right> 
<P>&nbsp;Executives can advance in rank by assisting their downline affiliates to become Executives. The Bronze, Silver and Gold Executives have developed one, two, or three first-level Executives respectively. The Ruby, Emerald and Diamond Executives have developed three first-level Executives at the previous rank. 
<P>When an Affiliate qualifies as an Executive, they "break-away" from their sponsor and are no longer part of their sponsor's group sales volume. Executives must maintain a monthly group sales volume of at least $6000 from all downline affiliates that are not&nbsp;yet an Executive to qualify for the Executive Bonus. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Executive Bonus</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>Executive bonuses are paid to Executives on the total group sales volume of all Executives below them to the qualified levels. For example, a Gold Executive receives a 5% Executive Bonus on the group sales volume of all Executives below him down to three levels.&nbsp; 
<P><IMG hspace=75 src="Images\execbonus.jpg" align=middle> <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Executive Car Bonus</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P><IMG hspace=10 src="Images\carbonus.jpg" align=right> All Executives qualify for a monthly car bonus from $300 to $1000 based on their Executive rank. <FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><B>Breakage Bonuses</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>Pinnacle guarantees a compensation payout of 60% of the membership revenue. Unqualified compensation is placed in a pool for distribution back to the affiliates. The pool is used for recognition and travel awards and bonuses for specific accomplishments.

<P><B>Compensation Example</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>Affiliates can earn compensation in many different ways including high-volume retail sales, building small sales teams to supplement existing salaries, or building large sales organizations to create full-time incomes. The following is an example of one possible way that compensation could be earned and is not intended to represent any affiliate’s actual earnings. 
<P>The following example is based on developing three affiliates in one month and assisting them to do the same. Of course, accelerating the recruiting rate will also increase the earnings. 
<P>The following earnings include the Manager Bonus and the Executive Car Bonuses, but they do not include the Breakage Bonuses, which could be substantial for the serious business builders. 
<P>Note: The cost of the monthly training membership is earned in the second month as a Manager. 
<P>Reaching Manager is accomplished by building a 3x2 sales organization of 12 affiliates. 
<P>Reaching Executive is accomplished by extending to a 3x4 sales organization of 120 affiliates. 
<P>Reaching Gold Executive is accomplished by building a 3x3 sales organization of 39 Executives. 
<P>Reaching Diamond Executive is accomplished by extending to a 3x6 sales organization of 1092 Executives.
