<P><FONT size=3>Although the acquisition of knowledge in and of itself does not hold the key to individual salvation, there are some significant benefits for all men in the learning process. In fact, those benefits are so great that none of us can afford to stop being students.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The first fruit of knowledge, it seems to us, is the realization that there is so much more to learn. It is true that there are some who become “puffed up” with a little bit of knowledge and decide that they have acquired a monopoly on the world’s wisdom. But the honest seeker after truth can almost be overwhelmed by his own inadequacy as he acquires more information, whether it is secular or religious.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>And with this humility in the face of all there is to know comes a broader vision of the complexity of life and living. The tunnel view of existence that so many of us have can be widened by every scrap of information we acquire.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Knowledge is a forerunner of wisdom, and with wisdom men can avoid the emotionalism and extremes that characterize so much of life today. There is ample evidence in the world that passion and fanaticism breed violence, hate, and distrust. What would a thoughtful, moderate, rational attitude do for the Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland? For the Arabs and Jews in the Mideast? For dissatisfied students throughout the world? For a father and son who meet head on in a family quarrel? </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Contrary to what some would have us believe, there are eternal verities; there are truths that should be defended with a passion. But in most of our normal relations the world would be a better place if we were less strident and less sure about those things upon which the Lord has not spoken.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Knowledge sought for the purpose of bringing us into an exalted state will humble us. It will teach us that honest men may disagree without either man being motivated by evil intent.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The Lord expects us to stretch our intellectual capacity to its limits. He has made it clear that we are continually to acquire knowledge and information upon all subjects. Our pursuit of perfection will never be successful through the mere rote performance of “legalistic” duty. Perfection is a spiritual attitude and commitment as well as the acquisition of all knowledge within the capabilities with which we are blessed.</FONT>
