<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">When you use part of your
home for business, you may be able to deduct expenses for what the IRS
calls the "business use of your home." <br><br>The home office
deduction is available to renters and homeowners alike. It is available
for office space and other areas you use for business in your home --
such as a studio, workshop, or garage. And according to the IRS, your
"home" can be a house, condo, or apartment unit -- or even a mobile
home or boat, as long as you can cook and sleep there. However, you
must meet two tax law requirements to qualify for the home office
deduction:<br><br>Requirement #1: You must regularly use part of your home exclusively for a trade or business.<br><br>Requirement #2: You must also be able to show at least one of the following:<br><br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">You use your home as your principal place of business. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">You meet patients, clients, or customers at home. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">You use a separate structure on your property exclusively for business purposes.</font></li></ul><font face="Verdana" size="3">We'll explain these requirements in turn below.</font><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><br><br>Regular and Exclusive Use</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">To take deductions for home-related expenses, you must regularly use part of your home exclusively for your trade or business.<br><br>Regular
use. The IRS doesn't offer a clear definition of regular use -- only
that you must use a part of your home for business on a continuing
basis, not just for occasional or incidental business. You can probably
meet this test by working a couple of days a week from home, or a few
hours each day.<br><br>Exclusive use. Exclusive use means that you use
a portion of your home only for business. If you use a room of your
home for your business and also for personal purposes, you don't meet
the exclusive use test. However, you can set aside a portion of a
larger room to be used only for business, as long as your personal
activities don't stray into it.<br><br></font></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">Example:<br><br></font><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">Brook,
a lawyer, uses a den in his home to write legal briefs and prepare
contracts. He also uses the den for poker games and hosting a book
club. Because he uses the den for both business and pleasure, Brook
can't claim business deductions for using the den.</font><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">Marvin
has a den he uses only for business. He also puts a business calendar,
desk, and computer in his kitchen, but continues to cook and eat there
as well. Marvin can claim business deductions for the den, but not the
kitchen. </font><br style="font-style: italic;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font><br></div><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;<br><br>There
are two exceptions to the exclusive use rule: You don't have to meet
the exclusive use test if you use part of your home to store inventory
or product samples, or if you run a qualified day care facility at your
home. (The storage exception is discussed just below. For the day care
rules, check IRS Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, at
www.irs.gov.)<br><br>Storing inventory or product samples at home. If
you store inventory or samples at home, you can deduct expenses for the
business use of your home, whether or not you use the storage space
exclusively for business.<br><br>There are two limitations, however:
First, you won't qualify for the deduction if you have an office or
other business location outside of your home. Second, you have to store
the products in a particular place -- your garage, for example, or a
closet or bedroom. It's okay to use the storage space for other
purposes as well, as long as you regularly use it for storing inventory
or samples. <br><br></font></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">Example:<br>&nbsp;</font><br style="font-style: italic;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">Jim
sells heating and air conditioning filters to small businesses. His
home is the only fixed location of his business. Jim regularly stores
his inventory of filters in half of his basement. He sometimes uses the
same area for working on his racing bikes. Jim can deduct the expenses
for the storage space, even though he doesn't use that part of his
basement exclusively for business.</font><br style="font-style: italic;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;</font><br></div><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;<br><br>Finally,
the home office deduction is available only if you are running a bona
fide business. If the IRS decides that you are indulging a hobby rather
than trying to earn a profit, it won't let you take the home office
deduction. <br></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">Principal Place of Business</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">In
addition to using part of your home regularly and exclusively for a
business, your home must be your "principal place of business." If you
conduct your business only from home, then you meet this requirement.
But if you have more than one business location (including your home)
for a single trade or business, you must determine whether your home is
your principal place of business for that enterprise.<br><br>Your home automatically qualifies as your principal place of business if both of the following are true:<br><br>You conduct the administrative or management activities of your business from home. <br>You have no other fixed location where you conduct those activities. <br></font></p><p align="left"></p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="font-style: italic;">Example:<br>&nbsp; </span></font><br style="font-style: italic;"><font face="Verdana" size="3"><span style="font-style: italic;">Ellen,
a wallpaper installer, performs services for clients in their homes and
offices. She also has a home office that she uses regularly and
exclusively to keep her books, arrange appointments, and order
supplies. Ellen is entitled to deduct home office expenses for that
part of her home (assuming she also satisfies the "regular and
exclusive use" rule, above).</span></font><br style="font-style: italic;"></div><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In
other words, your home doesn't have to be the place where you generate
most of your business income. It's enough that you regularly use it for
tasks such as keeping your books, scheduling appointments, doing
research, and ordering supplies. As long as you have no other fixed
location where you do these things -- for example, an outside office --
you should be able to take the deduction.<br><br>Even if your home is
not your principal place of business or you have another location,
there are two other ways to fulfill the principal place of business
requirement:<br><br>You meet clients or customers at home. If you
regularly use part of your home to meet with clients, customers, or
patients, you may qualify for the deduction. Doing so even one or two
days a week is probably sufficient. You can use the business space for
other business purposes, too -- doing bookkeeping, for example, or
other business paperwork -- but you'll lose the deduction if you use
the space for personal purposes, such as watching videos.<br><br>Maintain
an appointment log in which you carefully note the name of the client
or customer and the date and time of each meeting at your home. Save
these books for at least three years. These logs will document your
business use of your home if your tax return is audited by the IRS.<br><br>You
use a separate building for your business. You can deduct expenses for
a separate, freestanding structure that you use regularly and
exclusively for your business. This might be a studio or a converted
garage or barn, for example. The structure doesn't have to be your
principal place of business or a place where you meet patients, clients
or customers. But be sure you use the structure only for your business:
You can't store garden supplies there or use it for the monthly meeting
of a club.<br><br>How to Claim the Home Office Deduction</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">If
you qualify for the home office deduction, you must figure the amount
of your deduction on IRS Form 8829, Expenses for Business Use of Your
Home. (You can find this and other tax forms at the IRS website,
www.irs.gov.) Then you enter the total amount of the deduction on
Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business. Attach both Form 8829 and
Schedule C to your Form 1040 tax return.<br><br>Be ready to prove to
the IRS that you are entitled to take the home office deduction. Here
are some steps you can take to help establish your legal right to
deduct home office expenses:<br><br></font></p><ul><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Photograph
your home office and draw a diagram showing the location of the office
in your home. Keep this information in your tax folder. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Have your business mail sent to your home. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Use your home address on your business cards and stationery and in all business ads. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Get a separate phone line for the business. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Have clients or customers visit your home office -- and keep a log of those visits. </font></li><li><font face="Verdana" size="3">Keep track of the time you spend working at home. </font></li></ul><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3"></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The expenses that you can deduct
include the business portion of your utilities, insurance, security system,
mortgage interest, rent, real estate taxes, depreciation, repairs, painting, and
other related costs.</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">There are two types of expenses
associated with your home office:</font></p>
