<BR></FONT><FONT size=4>Each and every page must <FONT color=#ff0000><B> Sell!</B></FONT></FONT><FONT size=2><FONT color=#ff0000> 
<P></FONT><FONT color=#000000>Start each page with a...</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=#000000>...grabber. Write a <B>benefit-laden opening paragraph</B> that sells your prospect on continuing deep into the page.</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>The opening line must answer the question that every visitor has as they reach a new page...</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2><B>"What's in it for me? Why should I spend my time reading this page?"</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>The remaining copy <B>must deliver</B> on the promise of the opener. Stick to the basics of good writing, hard, active copy, always aimed at the personality of your visitor.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>So, you've got a great opener.&nbsp; And your copy sizzles.&nbsp; Two final <B>tricks of the trade</B> will polish each page into a&nbsp;sharp, shinny selling tool...</FONT> 
<P><B>The Headline</B> - &nbsp;The headline is the larger, different colored type that separates major sections of a page.&nbsp; It pulls your visitor from one section of a page to the next. 
<P><FONT size=2><B>The Joint</B> - The joint is the end of one page that leads to the beginning of the next.&nbsp; It pulls your visitor through your lead program in your preferred order.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2><B>Headlines and joints must promise benefits and keep the visitor moving.</B> &nbsp; Headlines move your prospect to the next section of the same page.&nbsp; Joints move her on to the next page.&nbsp; <B>Good joints create predictable flow.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>In short, <B>each page</B> must...</FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=2><B>first</B>, pull the reader into the content</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2><B>then</B>, deliver the desired info, short and crisp</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2><B>finally</B>, make her want to click to the next page</FONT>
</UL>
<P><FONT size=2>Now let's look at the details of writing compelling headlines and joints...</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><B>The All-Important <FONT color=#ff0000>Headline</FONT></B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2><B>Headlines account for as much as 90% of the effectiveness of your lead program.</B> &nbsp; Ten times as many people read the headlines as read your body copy.&nbsp; If you don't use headlines or if you have poor ones, <B>you lose 90% of your program's sales potential.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>Strong, hard-hitting. benefit-laden headlines keep the reader <B>motivated and moving</B>.&nbsp; Hitting your customers "hot buttons" motivates him to read more.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>Headlines break up an endless string of paragraphs into readable sections - this makes it easy to continue.&nbsp; Craft lots of them.&nbsp; Use them to divvy up your paragraphs into small. logical, building blocks of text. <B>Headlines make the reader's job easy.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>Arrange the sections such that the page builds to a climax.&nbsp; The headlines must draw your visitor in, deeper and deeper.&nbsp; <B>Headlines make your reader's progression irresistible.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>Think of you headline as <B>an ad for the words that follow.</B> &nbsp; It has to pull the prospect into the copy. So... stress strong beliefs. Make powerful, tangible, customer-serving promises.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>An effective headline is important for many reasons...</FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=2>Attracts attention, making your page easily scanable</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Communicates a strong belief</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Appeals to the self-interest of the reader by answering. "Who cares? So What? What's in it for me?"</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Sets the tone</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Organizes the material, dividing it into logical text blocks</FONT>
</UL>
<P><FONT size=2>Here's how to write exciting headlines that <B>absolutely no one can</B> resist...</FONT><FONT size=2> 
<P><FONT size=3><B>How to Write Headlines that&nbsp;<FONT color=#ff0000>Hit</FONT></B></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>To write headlines that hit, identify your product's benefits.&nbsp; Phrase them to push your customer's hot buttons.&nbsp; Well-phrased benefits bring out emotions.&nbsp; People <B>act</B> due to their emotions.&nbsp; Then <B>justify</B> their decisions by using logic.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>So... <B>write down all the benefits</B> of your product.&nbsp; Then select the most meaningful ones.&nbsp; Use strong active verbs (e.g. slash, chop, stagger, etc.) to create powerful headlines with emotional impact... headlines that push your prospect's hottest button!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>For example. if you were writing a headline for a book called "How To Form Your Own Corporation Without a Lawyer for Under $75"...</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2><FONT color=#0000ff>"Wage Your Own Personal Tax Revolt"</FONT> OR <FONT color=#0000ff>"Build Your Own Ultimate Tax Shelter"</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=2>would be great, benefit-laden headlines.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2><B>First, a few <FONT color=#ff0000>do's...</FONT></B></FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=2>For each headline, write 10 before choosing the perfect one - never accept your first stab at a headline.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Stir an emotion. Get the reader excited or fearful or protective.&nbsp; Appeal directly to basic human needs and desires.&nbsp; Motivate to continue reading.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Use the present tense, or the imperative, which is far more emphatic. Use "you."</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>Use verbs that are vital and strong.&nbsp; Use short words that create images or pictures.&nbsp; Eliminate most adverbs and adjectives.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT size=2>The headline must stand on its own.&nbsp; Your visitor must understand it, and foresee where the following text is likely heading.</FONT>
</UL><FONT size=2>
<P><FONT size=2><B>A few <FONT color=#ff0000>do not's...</FONT></B></FONT> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=2>Avoid headlines that only create curiosity. Be benefit-driven, or the reader will feel deceived.</FONT> 
<LI>Do not try to be "catchy" or "cute", unless that will work with your target market. "Catch Phrases" call attention to the copy itself, which is distracting. Make the product the "hero", not the copy. 
<LI>Don't worry about what non-targeted visitors think of your headline.&nbsp; You are not writing for them - you're not after them.&nbsp; Focus... 
</UL><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>...on your target</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Here are a few more tried and true suggestions...</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Start with "Now" or "At Last" or "Announcing" or "Finally" or "How to" or "Why" or "FREE" 
<LI>Ask a question that begs to be answered 
<LI><B>Make only believable promises</B> - don't get carried away with hype. 
<LI>Use upper and lower case letters (typical Title style) NOT ALL CAPS (which screams) 
<LI>Do not vary appearance - maintain a consistent color and size across headlines and sub-headlines 
<LI>Sometimes, where appropriate and for extra credibility, put a headline inside quotation marks (e.g. <FONT color=#0000ff>"The Most Powerful Word Processor Yet"</FONT>) 
<LI>Challenge the reader (e.g. <FONT color=#0000ff>"Only for Investors Who Want to Use Their Own Brain"</FONT>) 
</UL><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

<P>Now here's how to write <B>joints</B> that pull prospects like herring in front of a cat's nose... 
<P><FONT size=3><B>Joints - - The Key to <FONT color=#ff0000>Visitor Pull-Through</FONT></B></FONT> 
<P>See how the <B>preceding</B> teaser&nbsp;sentence, followed by an elipse (...) with a promise of great success (joints that pull like herring in front of a cat), pulled you quickly into this section?&nbsp; That's how to make the end of one page "joint" into the next. 
<P><B>The Joint</B> is the end of one page that leads to the beginning&nbsp;of the next.&nbsp; It is the most important tool that you have to lead your visitor through your lead program <B>in your preferred order</B> . 
<P>End each page with the need for the reader to click.&nbsp; Make her click to the next page - use questions or elises (...) or incomplete sentences that beg to be finished... whatever it takes to get her to click through to the next page with curiosity, excitement and enthusiasm. 
<P>The end of a page is a danger spot where people may decide to leave. A good joint keeps your visitor&nbsp;on your lead program.&nbsp; It keeps her moving towards the <B><FONT color=#ff0000>MWR</FONT> Closer&nbsp;Page.</B> &nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp; 
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>In a sense, a joint is a <B>"call to action"</B> &nbsp; that pulls your visitor onwards.&nbsp; <B>Basically, your <FONT color=#ff0000>"MWR"</FONT> for each Non-Response page is to <FONT color=#ff0000>make your visitor click to the next page</FONT>.</B> 
<P><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp; Each page must fit together and build into the next.&nbsp; Each must do its part to compel the prospect to <B>deliver</B> the ultimate goal, <B>the <FONT color=#ff0000>MWR</FONT>.</B> 
<P>Up to this point, we have used the word "joint" to mean that critical zone <B>between</B> pages, the end of one page that leads into the next. 
<P>But joints also exist <B>within</B> each page.&nbsp; Let's call these "<B> small-joints</B> ".&nbsp; The role of the small joint is to pull the reader through, <B>from one paragraph to the next</B>. 
<P>The "how to" for making small joints is the same as for developing full, inter-page joints. Let's see... 
<P><FONT size=3><B>How to Write a Magnetic Joint</B></FONT> 
<P>Joints must keep your visitor <B>on the page</B>.&nbsp; They must <B>pull him through as irresistibly...</B> 
<P>...as a giant magnet. 
<P><B>Here are a few more tried and true joint-building suggestions...</B> 
<P>End paragraphs with elipses (...), which leads the eye into the next paragraph.&nbsp; Start the other end of the joint by finishing these thoughts, <B>with impact.</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Ask a question that begs to be answered, especially one that implies big benefits. 
<LI>For small joints, start paragraphs with "And", "But", "So you see", "However". 
<LI>Use connectors like... 
<UL>
<LI>"What's more..." 
<LI>"And that's not all!" 
<LI>"Better Yet..." 
<LI>"So that's why..." 
<LI>"And not only that, but..." 
</UL>
<LI>Finish a page with a <B>teaser lead-in</B> to the next one. 
<LI><B>Don't leave his progress to chance.</B> &nbsp; At the bottom right of every page, <B>clearly lead your visitor to the next page</B>.&nbsp; Include an arrow button pointing to the right! 
</UL>
<P>Remember, <B>each paragraph</B> must deliver the reader <B>to the <FONT color=#ff0000>next</FONT> paragraph...</B> 
<P>Each <B>block</B> of paragraphs (headed&nbsp; by a headline) must deliver the visitor <B>to the <FONT color=#ff0000>next</FONT> block.</B> 
<P>Each <B>page</B> of copy must deliver your customer <B>to the <FONT color=#ff0000>next</FONT> page</B>.&nbsp; Clicking to the next page is your "Most Wanted Reponse" <B>for that page.&nbsp; It's the joints</B> that pull your reader through all the "click-somewhere-else" <B><FONT color=#ff0000>danger points</FONT></B> .
