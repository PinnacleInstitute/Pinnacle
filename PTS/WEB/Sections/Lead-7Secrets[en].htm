<P align=left></FONT>Most leads are simply not as fresh as the company claims!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Beware when a company is making guarantees on the age of their leads.&nbsp; Many lead retailers claim they are selling you 5, 15, even 30 day old leads...&nbsp; What they don't tell you is that MOST of the Lead Retailing companies are simply buying "wholesale" leads from a few major suppliers.&nbsp; So yes... when the retailer receives them from the wholesaler they are 5,15 or 30 days old but by the time those leads reach you the end client they could be twice even three times the age the company claims!&nbsp; Not so fresh after all.</FONT>

<P align=left></FONT></B>They claim your leads are exclusive? Read the fine print!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Many fly-by night Lead retailers will claim that your leads are exclusive to you. They'll tell you nobody else will have that persons contact information.&nbsp; Yeah... Right that only lasts about 5 days though and then the Lead will be pawned off to some other unsuspecting person.&nbsp; Sure it's great if you get the first batch but that's highly unlikely unless you are a frequent purchaser or have an "in" with the owner of the lead business.&nbsp; You could receive the leads after they have already been approached by 5 or 6 other marketers before you.&nbsp; Do you really think they will be very receptive to your offer after being approached by so many other marketer's offers?&nbsp; I highly doubt it.&nbsp; They will probably be trying to pitch a program back at you!</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Surprised to hear that they were never interested in a home based business opportunity?</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>This happens all the time.&nbsp; It stems from a process called "Co-Registration" And millions of leads are generated this way everyday.&nbsp; Let's say for example you made a product purchase online...&nbsp; You bought some Avon products.&nbsp; At some point during your purchase they will probably ask you several questions like... "Would you like to receive more information on similar products?" or "Would you be interested in receiving offers from our partners?" Many people will click YES...&nbsp; Guess What?&nbsp; They just unknowingly became a business opportunity seeking lead for any company selling Avon related or household products.&nbsp; It doesn't mean they want to start a home based business.&nbsp; Hence why so many of them have no idea why your calling them.&nbsp; They were just online looking for cheap deals!</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Where Lead Retailers really make their money is in selling you a "prospecting system" with a monthly recurring charge. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>They will rope you into a monthly charge promising to send you a set amount of leads every day, week or month.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; They have several other clients subscribing as well.&nbsp; They simply re-distribute their old leads.&nbsp; You have them for one week and then John Doe gets them the next.&nbsp; These leads could change hands as many as ten times during any given month.&nbsp; Back to the point that was made earlier.&nbsp; After receiving several offers from other marketers how receptive will these leads be if they haven't already joined something?&nbsp; Not Very.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>There are only so many people looking for a new business at one time.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Contrary to what they want you to believe there really are NOT millions and millions of people looking for online or work at home business opportunities.&nbsp; Be wary of companies that are blasting your ad to Millions of leads or selling a CD with 80 Million names and emails.&nbsp; Sure there is a definite market for home based business but with the thousands of lead retailers out there I think they have sold the world over several times now.&nbsp; It's all the same people over and over again.&nbsp; Their information is simply bought, used and then sold again.</FONT> 
<P align=center><FONT size=4><B>Lead Secret # 6.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>There are only a handful of "Lead Generators" everyone else is simply buying wholesale and then selling them to you!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>It's true!&nbsp; there really is only a handful of actual Lead Generators online.&nbsp; They then sell their leads to the suppliers many of you buy from on a daily basis.&nbsp; There are a few problems with this.&nbsp; When that wholesaler sells their leads to the retailer they can still sell that list to 5 -10 Other lead retailers as well!&nbsp; And then those Lead retailing companies turn around and sell each of those leads to 5 or 10 of their customers, Guess what...?&nbsp; Now you have a full-matrix!&nbsp; It's called the SPAM &amp; unwanted phone call Matrix.</FONT>
