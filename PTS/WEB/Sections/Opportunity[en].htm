<P align=left><FONT size=2><FONT color=#993300 size=3><B>Opportunity Criteria!</B></FONT> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>Before we get started its important to first give you the criteria for evaluating an income opportunity. Please take some notes so that you can apply these criteria to whatever opportunities you are currently involved with or may encounter in the future as you strive to generate extra income, reach financial independence, or accumulate real wealth. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Unfortunately a few scam artists have tainted our industry, so we at Pinnacle want you to know up front, how to judge a solid long-term opportunity before you invest either your time or your hard earned money. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>It’s important that you find the right opportunity for you personally. It’s equally important that you find an opportunity that has long-term stability, with the ability to provide a continuous income stream for your financial, emotional, and time investment, in other words, that you have a regular monthly income once you’ve built your sales team. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Listen carefully to these criteria and you will be equipped with the tools to identify a successful company and save yourself from wasting your time and money on the questionable companies that lack the foundation to provide you with a lasting and satisfying residual income. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><B><FONT color=#993300 size=3>Sophisticated Investors!</FONT></B> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>Sophisticated investors analyze three factors in all opportunities, the People, the Product, and the Return On Investment or the ROI. You also, should look carefully at all three of these factors. If any of these are missing, keep looking until you find an opportunity that satisfies all the criteria. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><B><FONT color=#993300 size=3>The People!</FONT></B> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>Let’s consider The People first, these are the people who are guiding the company and making decisions that will affect your income. There are two basic metrics here; is the management team trustworthy, and is it competent? The best measure of this is past history. Do your homework, spend the time to carefully checkout the background of the management team. Make sure, to the best of your ability, that the management is trustworthy and competent. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><B><FONT color=#993300 size=3>The Product!</FONT></B> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>The Product should have mass appeal and should be consumed regularly to provide a residual income stream for your sales efforts. Companies that depend on initial one-time sales lack the revenue and commissions from a stable satisfied customer base. The product must also be of high quality to generate excitement and passion for the product. And finally, the product must have retail value and must be attractive to outside individuals for retail sale, regardless of the income opportunity. In other words, the product must stand on its own. The Product must be a quality consumable product with mass appeal and real retail value. If it does not, the company cannot endure long-term. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><FONT color=#993300>The Return On Investment! 
<BR></FONT></B>The ROI is what you get for your investment. Money is just a small part of your overall contribution. Your major investment is in time, emotional energy, and the risk to your integrity with the friends, co-workers and family members you invite to join your program. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Confirm that the income opportunity is legal. There should be no indication of “free money” or “no work required”. It should attract individuals that are willing to work hard to build a personal and financially rewarding business. You should be able to fairly quickly earn enough money to cover your costs of operation and benefit from the tax advantages you gain by having a home-based business. You should also be able to earn a good regular income in a reasonable amount of time, and there should be an opportunity to create a very attractive income stream for the motivated sales leaders and business builders. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><B><FONT color=#993300 size=3>The Right Opportunity!</FONT></B> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>Our opportunity can enable you to earn the equivalent of a professional income in much less time than it takes to get a college education, where you can invest four to five years in getting a college degree to be qualified to look for a job, or you can invest less than half that time with Pinnacle to create a business to pass down to your children. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><FONT color=#993300>Company Stability &amp; Excitement! 
<BR></FONT></B>Most full-time wage earners are satisfied to augment their regular income with 300 to 500 extra dollars each month. The stability of a company is determined by the number of part-time distributors that can earn that extra $300 to $500 monthly. The excitement in a company is determined by its ability to provide $50,000 and more each month for the visionaries that will invest in the large marketing events and market expansions. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Well there you have it, it all depends on The People, The Product and the Return On Investment. Consider these criteria carefully as we share with you the Pinnacle Performance Institute Opportunity, which meets all of these criteria. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2><B><FONT color=#993300 size=3>The Pinnacle Founder!</FONT></B>
