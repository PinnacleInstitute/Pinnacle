<P><FONT size=3>There are three types of ads that ezine publishers&nbsp;usually offer: 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR><B>1) Classified Ad</B> 
<BR>This is typically a small 3 to 5 line ad that appears either at the beginning, middle or end of the ezine. These are the most affordably priced ads. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR><B>2) Sponsorship 
<BR></B>This is usually a much larger ad at (or near) the very top of the ezine. It usually costs a little more than a simple classified ad. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR><B>3) Stand-alone Or Solo Mailing 
<BR></B>When you do a solo mailing your message gets mailed to all the ezine subscribers all by itself; just your ad and nothing else. It's the most expensive of the three options. However, depending on the circulation of the ezine, this could be as low as $35.00 to about 5,000 people. 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR>When you're writing an ad for an ezine remember that you will only be able to use text. Keep it short, exciting and full of benefits. Don't forget a strong call to action.

<BR><B>Method #4.&nbsp;Forum Posting.&nbsp; Free &amp; It Works</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Where else can you easily contact thousands of people&nbsp;from all walks of life from all over the globe? And all&nbsp;with just a few mouse clicks! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The Internet has one particular gathering place that's&nbsp;the online equivalent of the office water cooler or&nbsp;talking to your neighbor over the backyard fence. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The place is called a Discussion&nbsp;Forum. It's not one single place. There are literally&nbsp;thousands of online Forums dedicated to almost any topic&nbsp;you can think of. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>They are a great place to make friends and build up your&nbsp;contacts, and thus people to prospect. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>To get an idea of how much business discussion is going&nbsp;on out there just go to Google and search for "MLM&nbsp;Forum." 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>There will be over 1 million results from your search! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Read through the posts on a few and see which ones match&nbsp;your personality and seem interesting to you. Register&nbsp;to participate in two or three to start with. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Spend some time just reading and watching for awhile.&nbsp;Don't just jump in and start posting. Get a feel for the&nbsp;community and what 'is' and what 'is not' considered&nbsp;polite and acceptable topics for discussion. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Try to get known as someone who is knowledgeable and&nbsp;willing to help in any way you can. People will begin to&nbsp;view you as a community leader and they will ask you&nbsp;about your business. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>Forum posting is definitely time consuming but has proven itself as one of the most effective free methods of generating real targeted traffic to a site.&nbsp; It's as easy as finding a forum or discussion board related to your industry and then start contributing to the discussions.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>There are several for the MLM/Network Marketing industry.&nbsp; When joining the forums please pay careful attention to your signature.&nbsp; In most cases this is the only way you can advertise.&nbsp; A signature is just a blurb that you create that will be at the tail of every one of your posts.&nbsp; You can include your lead program URL as well.&nbsp; Add to conversations whenever you can or just start asking questions.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The amount of traffic will not be staggering if you only post in one forum.&nbsp; Become active in a few different forums and be sure to read the posting rules.&nbsp; Before you start to post.</FONT> 
<P>&nbsp; 
<P align=center><B><FONT size=3>Method #5.&nbsp;Viral Marketing&nbsp; (Email Signature).</FONT></B> 
<P><FONT size=3>Viral Marketing is getting others to share your message with others who share your message, and so on,&nbsp;so that it spreads like a virus. One of the best vehicles for viral marketing is your own personal emails.&nbsp; Your emails are sometimes forwarded to others who also forward it to others.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>This is one of the most unused and misused online&nbsp;strategies. It applies both to online Forum posting&nbsp;and the e-mail&nbsp;you send out from your computer. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>An Email Signature&nbsp;is nothing more&nbsp;than a short snippet of text that goes either at the end&nbsp;of your Forum post or at the end of your e-mail. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Email signatures are very much like your business&nbsp;card in the offline world. If you're sending e-mail&nbsp;messages without a signature you're missing a powerful&nbsp;and FREE opportunity to promote your business. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Start by preparing a brief message to append to the&nbsp;bottom of all your outgoing e-mail messages. It can&nbsp;include whatever you like, but the more useful things&nbsp;are your name, web site address, telephone and perhaps&nbsp;a 'teaser line' to get people's curiosity fired up and 
<BR>motivate them to visit your web site or e-mail you. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp;Here's an example of a simple: 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp;============================== 
<BR>&nbsp;John Rep 
<BR>&nbsp;(555) 555-5555 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp;Fire Your Boss! Do It Today! 
<BR>&nbsp;http://www.YouShouldBeFree.com 
<BR>&nbsp;============================== 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Distinguish your signature. Whether you separate it from&nbsp;the body of your letter with a line or enclose it with a&nbsp;box of asterisks is a personal matter. Just be sure it's&nbsp;clear that it's separate from the body of your message.&nbsp;Give it its own presence. However, don't go to the&nbsp;opposite extreme. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Some signatures&nbsp;are designed&nbsp;to look&nbsp;like some kind of artwork or cartoon. The trouble is, by&nbsp;the time it gets to the computer it's all messed up. It&nbsp;ends up looking like a monkey came along and started&nbsp;pounding on the keyboard. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Many also seem to believe that abundantly applying&nbsp;dollar signs ($$$$$$) or TYPING IN ALL CAPS will&nbsp;make a lasting impression. They're right, it will...a&nbsp;long lasting bad impression. Also, this may be&nbsp;mistakenly considered to be junk e-mail and quickly&nbsp;thrown away. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>In some cases, future mail from you may simply be&nbsp;filtered directly into the trash; a personal 'black&nbsp;hole' made just for you. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>So, how do you make one and use it? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>1. Check the e-mail software you're using. There&nbsp;should be an option for "Create Signature" or&nbsp;"Create Signature Stamp" or some similar wording. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>2. Follow the instructions provided to create the file. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>3. Your signature file should be brief (50 words/less). 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>4. It should provide contact information including some&nbsp;of the following: your name, web site, e-mail, fax on&nbsp;demand, phone, fax, etc. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>5. It should provide at least one or two strong reasons&nbsp;for people to want to visit your site when they read the&nbsp;signature. This might be with a special offer, or a&nbsp;sentence or two about what they get if they visit your&nbsp;site, etc. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Now, whenever you send out an e-mail message be sure&nbsp;your signature file is attached. It saves you from&nbsp;having to type the same information over and over again. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Even if you're sending a simple, non-business e-mail to&nbsp;your Aunt Sally, make sure that your signature is on there.&nbsp;She just might ask what you're up to and what that&nbsp;'stuff' at the bottom of your e-mail means. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Hah! A chance to tell her about your business. Okay, it&nbsp;might end up being just for practice, but who knows. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Now let's say you e-mailed Aunt Sally a joke you read&nbsp;and thought she might enjoy. Well, it turns out she&nbsp;liked it very much. So what does she do? She sends it&nbsp;out to everybody on her address list. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>One of the people on her list (Bob) happens to&nbsp;participate in an e-mail discussion list with about five&nbsp;hundred members worldwide. Dave decides to forward the&nbsp;joke to the entire five hundred member discussion list. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Before you know it, someone in Australia is reading your&nbsp;joke...and your email signature! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Are you seeing the light now?&nbsp; </FONT><FONT size=3>Make Sure Your Signature&nbsp;Is On EVERY E-Mail&nbsp;That Leaves Your Computer!
