<P align=left>
<BR></FONT>If you're like any other network marketer trying to prospect and recruit online you probably have already figured out that these replicated websites that most&nbsp;Network Marketing companies hand out for free to their distributors don't really convert visitors into signups or leads very well...</FONT>
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>And Why Is That?</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>It's simple, the websites that most of these companies are handing out are providing your visitors with way too much information and no real defined course of action.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>When you go and present someone with a whole pile of information right away you are creating confusion.</FONT> 
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>Confusion leads the visitor towards indecision.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>And this will have your visitor clicking the "back" button in their browser and getting&nbsp;outta there.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You probably already know that when doing any type of prospecting or recruiting on the Internet you need to have fresh people to talk to.&nbsp; Not only that but you need their contact information as well, so you can follow up with them and start forging a relationship with them.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Most company sites do not supply this.&nbsp; They do not place a lead capture form on your replicated website.&nbsp; So it's left up to your visitors to contact you.&nbsp; And 9 times out of ten we both know this doesn't happen unless they are a real go-getter.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The companies that do provide you with a lead capture form on your site usually collect the leads themselves and then want to sell them back to you!</FONT> 
<P align=center><FONT size=3><B>Having your own lead capture page is a quick solution for this problem.</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>With a custom lead capture page you are able to present your opportunity in a much softer, simpler way.&nbsp; When you make it very easy for your prospect to take the next step they most likely will.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>With a lead capture page we aren't trying to totally sell the prospect on your opportunity right away and force an hour or two of reading on them...</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Think of it as more of a teaser page.&nbsp; We are simply trying to entice them to request more information.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>And because of the simplicity, you can believe it works!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Have a look at your current company issued website and see what you think.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Would it scare you away at first glance?</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>When it comes to prospecting on the Internet the simpler and more direct your website is the more visitors you will be able to convert into leads.</FONT>
