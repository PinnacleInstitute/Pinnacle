<P><B><FONT size=3>Introduction</FONT></B> 
<BR>The Pinnacle Sales Prospecting System (SPS) is a sales tool designed specifically for lead tracking.&nbsp; Typical sales activities can be categorized into one of the following three categories. 
<BR>
<BR>1.&nbsp;<B> Lead Generation</B> :&nbsp; The identification of a qualified lead 
<BR>2.&nbsp;<B> Lead Tracking</B> : The conversion of a qualified lead to a customer 
<BR>3.&nbsp;<B> Customer Management</B> : The ongoing sales and service to an existing customer. 
<BR>
<BR>SPS takes a qualified lead identified as a suspect and manages the process of converting the suspect to a prospect and eventually to a final response of yes, no or maybe later.&nbsp; Many methods are used to generate qualified leads including; personal acquaintances, networking, referral sources, mailing lists, telemarketing, search engine optimization, bulk email campaigns, etc. Email lead generation is typically spamming and is not recommended by Pinnacle.&nbsp; Spamming is a socially unacceptable practice and is done at the risk of criminal prosecution.&nbsp; Customer Management is closely aligned with a company’s specific operations, which typically requires a custom solution. 
<P><FONT size=3><B>Administrator Setup 
<BR></B></FONT>Before a company can use the lead tracking capabilities of SPS, it must setup a few customizable features.&nbsp; Each company can define its own custom list of prospect types, sales campaigns with multiple sales steps, and optional custom email messages for automated sales steps.&nbsp; Access to SPS must be enabled for each individual member. 
<BR>The company administrator can access SPS after signing into Pinnacle by selecting the “My Sales” link under the “Manage Business” caption on the navigation bar on the left hand side of the page. 
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Prospect Types</FONT></B> 
<BR>Select the “Prospect Types” link in the upper right hand corner of the “Sales Prospecting System” page. Select the “Add New Prospect Type” link on the upper right hand corner of the page to specify the name and sequence of the new prospect type.&nbsp; Existing prospect types are displayed in a list in sequence order. Click the name of the prospect type in the list to edit the existing prospect type. Some examples of prospect types may include; individual, small business, corporation, non-profit organization, etc. 
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Sales Campaigns</FONT></B> 
<BR>A sales campaign defines a specific set of steps to convert a suspect into a customer.&nbsp; A company can define multiple sales campaigns for managing different methods of converting qualified leads (e.g. Direct Sales, Telemarketing, Trade Show, etc.).&nbsp; 
<BR>Select the “Sales Campaigns” link in the upper right hand corner of the “Sales Prospecting System” page.&nbsp; Select the “Add New Sales Campaign” link on the upper right hand corner of the page to specify the name and sequence of the new sales campaign.&nbsp; New sales campaigns can also be copied from an existing sales campaign by entering the existing Sales Campaign # on the bottom of the add page.&nbsp; All sales steps of the specified existing sales campaign will be copied to the new sales campaign.&nbsp; Existing sales campaigns are displayed in a list in sequence order.&nbsp; Click the name of the sales campaign in the list to edit the existing sales campaign. 
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Sales Steps 
<BR></FONT></B>A sales campaign consists of a specified number of sales steps to convert a qualified lead to a customer.&nbsp; The sales steps are listed as the status options for the prospect.&nbsp; The prospect may be advanced through the sales steps manually by the sales person (i.e. member) or automatically by the system as specified by the sales steps.&nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR><B>PREDEFINED SALES STEPS</B> :&nbsp; Every sales campaign has five predefined sales steps in addition to the custom sales steps defined by the company administrator.&nbsp; The first two predefined steps are “Suspect” – the date the prospect was entered into the system, and “First Appointment” – the date that the first appointment was set (not the date of the appointment). The first appointment date is used by a sales management report on the sales person’s effectiveness at filling their sales pipeline.&nbsp; The company’s custom sales steps follow the first two predefined sales steps.&nbsp; The last three predefined sales steps include; “Fallback” – a prospect that is temporarily stalled and won’t commit to a next step, “Closed” – a successfully completed deal, and “Dead” – a lost deal. 
<BR>The sales steps are listed in step # order on the bottom of the sales campaign page. Select the “Add New Sales Step” link on the upper right hand corner of the list to specify the name and options of the new sales step.&nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR><B>BASIC INFORMATION</B> :&nbsp; The basic sales step information includes an identifying name, description displayed on the prospect page, a unique step # defining the sales step sequence and reference # for automated sales steps.&nbsp; The recommended number of hours for the sale step to be completed can also be specified for sales management reporting. 
<BR>
<BR><B>MILESTONE DATE</B> : The sales step may optionally be tracked when it was achieved. Enter a unique value from 1 - 10 to select the milestone number. Each tracked sales step of the sales campaign must have its own unique milestone number. A zero entry will not be tracked as a milestone.&nbsp; Although a sales campaign can have an unlimited number of sales steps, only ten of the steps can be milestones. 
<BR>
<BR><B>SALES BOARD</B> : The sales step may optionally be displayed on the Sales Board report that lists all active sales prospects with their current value. Select the checkbox to display the sales step on the Sales Board.&nbsp; If selected, specify the typical conversion rate for prospects that reach this step. For example, if the average conversion rate for a step is 1 out of 4, enter .25 as the conversion rate. The conversion rate will be multiplied by the prospect's potential value to calculate an estimated current value on the Sales Board. 
<BR>
<BR><B>AUTOMATED EMAIL STEP</B> : The sales step may optionally be an automatic step to be performed immediately (within the hour) by the system. Select the “Email Prospect” option or leave unselected for no automatic step. Select the email message from the second combo box for this automated email step.&nbsp; Sales Prospect email messages are created with the Email Manager. Click the “View” button to view a preview of the email message. 
<BR>
<BR><B>SPAM NOTICE</B> :&nbsp; Pinnacle disallows any and all spamming activities.&nbsp; Any mass email sent to a prospect that has not opted into the relationship is considered spam.&nbsp; Automated email messages are convenient for leading a qualified suspect to becoming a prospect and agreeing to a first appointment. 
<BR>
<BR><B>AUTOMATED NEXT STEP</B> : The sales step may optionally be automatically advanced to the next sales step after a specific number of hours. Specify the next Step # to go to after this step is performed and the number of hours before changing the prospect to the new sales step.&nbsp; Predefined steps can also be specified as the next step (e.g. -3 = Fallback, -4 = Closed, -5 = Dead). 
<BR>
<BR><B>SALES STEP ATTACHMENTS</B> : The sales step may also include attached documents with support information like sales scripts and reference documents.&nbsp; The administrator must go to the existing sales step page to attach documents.&nbsp; A link is displayed on the top of the prospect page to view the attached sales documents for the current sales step. 
<P><B><FONT size=3>Email Messages

<BR>
<BR>The email message includes an identifying name, from email address, subject, status, and email body.&nbsp; Change the status from "Compose" to "Ready" when the email message is ready to be used. 
<BR>
<BR><B>FORMATTED MESSAGE</B> :&nbsp; The email message body can be formatted with an editor on the web page.&nbsp; Click the up arrow in the upper right hand corner of the editor to edit the message in a larger popup window. For help with the editor, Click the question mark "?" in the upper right hand corner of the editor.&nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR><B>REPLACEABLE TAGS</B> :&nbsp; The email message “Body” and "Subject" may include replacable tags enclosed in curly brackets for the prospect's first name {firstname}, last name {lastname}, unique identifier {id}, member's first name {m-firstname}, member's last name {m-lastname}, member's email address {m-email}, and member's phone number {m-phone}. The "from email address" may also specify the member's email address {m-email}. 
<BR>
<BR><B>EMAIL RSVP</B> :&nbsp; The email message may include one or more links to a utility URL that can play a video file, display a custom page, update the next step for the prospect, and record an RSVP response. All parameters are optional. A typical email message may contain multiple links to the same URL to take different actions based on the prospect's selection. The RSVP can indicate a positive response (1), a negative response (2), or any other value of importance to the company. A note will be added by the system documenting the RSVP response, video watched, and page viewed.
