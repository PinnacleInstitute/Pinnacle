After you complete all the lessons for your class you will have the option to print 
a certificate from the class page. Click the "Print Certificate" 
button to confirm your name as you would like it to appear on the 
certificate. A "Print Dialog Box" is displayed for you to select the 
desired printer. If you pass the optional quiz(es), you will be able 
to print a "Certificate of Achievement", otherwise you will be able to 
print a "Certificate of Completion".

</SPAN></B><P>
Pinnacle automatically starts the printing process after you confirm your name as 
it shoud appear on the certificate, by displaying the "Print Dialog 
Box". Cancel this Dialog Box and select the "File / Print Preview" 
menu option to view the certificate before printing.

What do I do if I get a downloading error when printing a certificate?
</SPAN></B><P>
Pinnacle dowloads an Active X control to automatically set the printing formatting options 
for the certificate. If you have a problem downloading this file, 
you can manually set the printing options. On the "Printing 
Certificate..." page, cancel the "Print Dialog Box" and select the "File / 
Page Setup" menu option. Remove the header and footer 
information, select the "Landscape" orientation, and set all margins to 
1/2 inch. Select the "File / Print" or "File / Print Preview" menu 
option to print the certificate.

How do I print a framable certificate?
</SPAN></B><P>
Pinnacle certificates are printed with a 1/2 inch margin on a 8 1/2 x 11 inch 
paper. This will frame nicely in a 8 1/2 x 11 frame or a 8 x 10 
frame. If you would like the certificate to center exactly in a 8 x 
10 frame, set the left and right margins to .75 inches by selecting the 
"File / Page Setup" menu option in your browser. 

<P><B><SPAN style="COLOR: #993300">
How do I print a good quality certificate?
</SPAN></B><P>
For best printing results, use a color printer and bright white card stock paper (80 - 110 
lb.). You may also try printing on light colored paper like a nice 
parchment stock. These special papers can be purchased at any office 
supply store.
