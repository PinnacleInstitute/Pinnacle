Amanda,
<P>I called and left a message at the number you gave me on the website, I was cut off during the middle of it--guess that means I was too long-winded :-) Just wanted to let you know that you can call me back at 863-307-4449 (home) or 863-224-1069 (cell).
<P>If you have decided that you really don't want anymore information or&nbsp;a free trial, please don't feel shy telling me...I don't want to bother you if you are not interested.
<P>Here is another site to look at, it's our new product called the LaundryPure--it's amazing!! All of our products are certified by the Space Station/NASA.
<P>www.myhealthyessentials.info (the only difference is the .info at the end)
<P>Look forward to talking with you soon.
