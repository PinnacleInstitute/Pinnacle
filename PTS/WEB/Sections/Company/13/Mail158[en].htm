It was such a pleasure speaking with you. I pray for your family and your thoughts and I will be calling you again on September 5, 06 at about 6:30 pm, if this is ok. If not email me and let me know when it would be a better time. I hope&nbsp;your children got the chance to get on line with the computer and have a little fun. Sounds like my grandchildren.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
<P>Again, thank you for your time and don't do something you don't want to do,&nbsp;give it to God and give it some thought. I'm sure you will make the right decision.
<P>God bless you and your family,
