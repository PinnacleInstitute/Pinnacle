<FONT size=3>Hello Gerald: <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>My name is Jim Lytch and we recently spoke&nbsp;on the phone regarding my organization, EcoQuest International. In the&nbsp;information you filed with Christian Eco-Specific Prospects for ManagerFactoryLeads.com web site, when asked you&nbsp;selected the example&nbsp;to "Love what I do". With our&nbsp;organization and working from home you can love what you do and help people at the same time. I am looking for management type&nbsp;prospects&nbsp;that can take instructions and&nbsp;follow proven ways in which to earn $2,500.00 a month and more, much more with hard work.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>In our recent conversation I asked if you would go to one of my web sites (airunlimited.net) and look it over and if you are still interested in being in business for yourself at home, fill out the information at the end of the site and I'll get back to you for your next step. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Again, thank you for your time and concern. Feel to contact me with any questions you may have at 913-371-1634.&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>God bless, </FONT>
