</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc><B>How do I generate leads?</B> &nbsp; 
<BR>Success in our EcoQuest business is fueled by always being aware of how full our “Pipeline” is.&nbsp; The Alaska pipeline even though it is very large in diameter would only deliver as much oil at the end of the pipeline proportionate to the tributary sources that feeds it. In our EcoQuest business the pipeline is the “Process” in which we feed interested prospects into so that they can gather enough information to make an informed decision whether the opportunity is right for them or not.&nbsp; Our pipeline must be fed with multiple streams of interested prospects from various sources.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>
<P>&nbsp;These are just a few sources that we use to feed the “Pipe.” 
<BR>&nbsp; ·&nbsp;Warm Market Letters 
<BR>&nbsp; ·&nbsp;Direct Mail (We use Dan Gibson’s Christian Lead Letters) 
<BR>&nbsp; ·&nbsp;Classified Ads (Retailing and Recruiting) 
<BR>&nbsp; ·&nbsp;Trade Groups (Builders, Plumbers, Electricians, Painters, Pest Control etc) 
<BR>&nbsp; ·&nbsp;Cold Market</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>I believe the most difficult one thing we do in this business is….”Getting People’s Attention!”&nbsp; We are not short of product or opportunity information these days.&nbsp; We have everything from websites, printed materials, audio, DVD, conference calls to Lifeline calls with the President of our company.&nbsp; None of that matters though unless we have “enough” of a person’s attention that will examine one or more of these information sources.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>We don’t have a people problem, in other words “enough” people to share what we have but rather an “APPROACH” problem.&nbsp; How do we approach people (get their attention) so that they desire to review what we have?</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>One of my favorite approaches (learned from Doug Jackson) is: 
<BR>“IF I COULD……WOULD YOU……….?”&nbsp; I just fill in the blanks as I’m building a “Bridge of Trust” with the person.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc><U>Examples:</U></TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>John, “IF I COULD SHOW YOU A WAY how to get a new car of your choice within 6 months from an Inc 500 company who awards one almost daily” would you “Examine a couple websites that could make that happen?”&nbsp; NOTE: It could be DVD, Conference call, Opportunity Meeting, the new Business Kit or whatever tool that would be more likely to be examined by this particular individual.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>Mary, “IF I COULD SHOW YOU A WAY how to earn more income from home part time than your husband makes full time…WOULD YOU “Be available at 7:00PM tonight to listen in on a 15 minute conference call that could possibly make that happen?”</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>Fred,&nbsp; “IF I COULD SHOW YOU A WAY how to have expense paid vacations with your family around the World…WOULD YOU let me take you to lunch tomorrow and share with you how we’ve been doing that for the last 5 years?”</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>This has been very effective for us.&nbsp; The key is to ask enough questions of the person in order to know what problems they are trying to solve or what things they desire.&nbsp; </TD>

<TD><B>Biography:</B></TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>My name is Marty Huie.&nbsp; I have lived my entire life in Walla Walla, Washington a small community of 30,000 people.&nbsp; I have owned and operated my own Portrait Photography Studio since I was 20 years old. I earned the degree of Master Photographer in 1993 and have produced many five-figure portrait sales after listening to a colleague at a state convention in 1983.&nbsp; A change of thinking and action applied to better thinking changed my business that changed my income and ability. After running this business for twenty-seven years, I discovered a better business model in which I could get paid residually for helping people nationwide to international scale while having the privilege of operating based from my home. </TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>I love the freedom of working independently yet associated with a GREAT company and GREAT colleagues who are also independent thinkers.&nbsp; I personally believe that when one finds something he/she loves to do with a deep passion….one will never work another day in his/her life.&nbsp; There is joy in not only watching people get help with what our products do, but more importantly great joy in watching people grow personally, spiritually and financially.&nbsp; It feels good when I know I was instrumental in being the messenger of good news.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>Because I love to travel, one of my goals is to get a “See Ya” motor coach by Alpha, spring of 2008 that would qualify as our 4th bonus vehicle with EcoQuest.&nbsp; We would then get out (after our last child is through schooling) on the road and see the United States more leisurely while visiting and helping our EcoQuest business partners along the way. Because this business has unlimited potential, gas prices really don’t matter!</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>Our future goals is to move from Coordinating Managers to Key Manager by August 3, 2006 on time for the EcoQuest National Leadership Convention in Memphis, then Master Manager by 2007 convention.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>The power of so many high tech, yet high touch tools is what allows us to run an unlimited income business from home.&nbsp; The ETN tool is worth every penny of it’s monthly due for inspiration, motivation, how to information right from the comfort of my home or Internet anywhere.&nbsp; While driving from our home to the Orlando convention, we had the benefit of having full Internet capability in our bonus car while driving the highways of 21 different states.&nbsp; Money spent on having ETN is money in the bank!</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>EcoQuest is my LAST career dance at age 53.&nbsp; By the grace of God I was given this opportunity and by that same grace I will share it with others purposely making a difference one person at a time.</TD>
