Michael:
<P>Thank you for visiting my web site on Sunday.&nbsp; I hope it was helpful to you.&nbsp; If you didn't view the video, free free to return to the site, www.lpwash.com, and check it out.
<P>I left you a message Monday morning on your answering machine but have not heard back.&nbsp; As I indicated, I would be pleased to answer any questions you might have about this amazing new product.
<P>We offer a risk free 30 day evaluation of the LaundryPure in your home.&nbsp; If you are not completely satisfied, you merely return it to me.&nbsp; I can be reached at 888-217-7959, toll free, between the hours of 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM PST any day.&nbsp; I would need an address to ship the LaundryPure and some means by which it can be secured.
<P>Thanks again for your interest.&nbsp; There is nothing like this available in the market.&nbsp; As shown on the web site, the LaundryPure is good for the environment, saves you money, saves your clothes, needs no detergent, softener, or hot water, and helps eliminate possible skin irritation for those with such sensitivity.&nbsp; It is the ONLY appliance that will pay for itself in as little as 2 years or less&nbsp;for the average family.
<P>I look forward to hearing from&nbsp;you soon.
<P>John R. Newport
