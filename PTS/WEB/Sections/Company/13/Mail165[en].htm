<BR>Hello Dr Linn,
<P>It has been a while since I talked to you last, I hope all is well...Last we spoke you were on your way to do surgery in Houston and then on to LA..
<BR>You will have to let me know what happend.
<P>&nbsp;I am writing you tonight to see if you have any experience or know of this deficiency... I have a customer with it and I am just a bit concerned with her chronic attacks and lack of breathing ability.&nbsp; She is wanting clean air in her home and seems to have trouble living a regular life with regards to breathing normally...If you have any insight or know of any alternative treatments that may help please let me know.&nbsp; 
<BR>She is also wanting to start on the Enzyme Diet and several of the nutritional products since she is tired and just doesnt feel good all the time. I know that as a sales person I should not worry so much about other peoples problems, but I cant help it. I sincerely do not want any problems to get bigger or cause her serious problems...
<BR>I was just learning about one of our newest products the Essential Fatty Acids and how they are excelent as anti inflamitories even in people with asthma, since Alpha1 is symilar to Emphazyma do you think this may give her any benifit... It seems to have so many, I did not think it could hurt. Give me a call&nbsp; 727-233-3433
<P>thank you
<P>Nicole Day
<BR>PS did you ever get moved in to your new house yet?
