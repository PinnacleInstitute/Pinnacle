Mark:
<P>I enjoyed getting together briefly.&nbsp; I hope your next meeting in Cranberry went well.
<P>I&nbsp;trust that you have had a chance to further review the "stuff" I gave you and/or have additional discussion with other interested parties at Tudi.&nbsp; I have visited your web site and found it very interesting and informative.&nbsp; I particularly liked the links section and thank you for the contact information found there; I may be using some of it in the future.
<P>As I mentioned, I am available to meet again at any time (within reason) for a more formal presentation or for additional review of EcoQuest's products.&nbsp; I am confident that adding some of these to your product line could add to your bottom-line and customer satisfaction.&nbsp; Additionally, you would place youirself ahead of the curve, so to speak, in terms of assurances you could give your customers based on the Kansas State University study results I gave you.&nbsp; Our RCI technology is far superior to anything in the marketplace and is only available through authorized Business Owners like myself, or Tudi, if you decide to join us.
<P>Please call me at your convenience.&nbsp; I know you are very busy and I will not bother you with numerous follow-up calls but I may give you a call in a week or so if I haven't heard from you.&nbsp; I hope this is acceptable.
<P>Best regards,
<P>John
