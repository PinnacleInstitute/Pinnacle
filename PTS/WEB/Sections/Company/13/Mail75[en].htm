<BR>Hello Anna,
<P>&nbsp;I apologize that you were charged again, however since you financed your purifier through best finance they are the ones who charged you 30 days from the original charge. I have called them to put a hold on the acount and when I recieve the purifier and have a chance to check it over, I will have them process a refund to your card.&nbsp; The Laundry pure retails for the same as a Fresh Air. $747-&nbsp; The living waterIII retails for $449- .If you were looking to still sell the fresh air machines then your best bet for a success pack would&nbsp;be the Technology pack due to it comes with 5 fresh air machines, 1 living waterII, 1 spectrum, 1 fresh air buddy, 1 laundry pure and all of the magazines, brochures, dvd's and literature...etc. <A href="http://http://www.ecoquestintl.com/dealersupport/successpack.asp">http://www.ecoquestintl.com/dealersupport/successpack.asp&nbsp;</A>&nbsp;So I suppose that if you wanted to use them as demo's you very well could.&nbsp; Sounds like a great idea, keep them coming! Again if you are available I would like to get together for a quick phone call. I have an opening on Thursday evening...let me know.
<P>Talk to you soon
