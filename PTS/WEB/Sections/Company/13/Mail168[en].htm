It was a pleasure speaking with this morning about the LaundryPure.&nbsp; I know your doctor's appointments will go well this month and I look forward to hearing from you in October.&nbsp; I will make a note on my calendar to give you a call around the 15th if I have not heard back from you.
<P>Again, it was a pleasure and I look forward to meeting you next month.&nbsp; Please feel free to call if you have any further questions.
