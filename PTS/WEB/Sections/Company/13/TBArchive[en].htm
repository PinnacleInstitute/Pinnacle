<TD bgColor=#ffffcc>Hello, 
<BR>Are you the owner?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Hi, I'm Paul, what's your name? They must pay you a lot of money for all the responsibility you have running this place. You must be the manager?&nbsp; How long does it take for you to become a manager here? Have you been doing this long?&nbsp; When are you going to retire?&nbsp; Would you be interested in information that could help you retire much earlier?&nbsp; Look, I have this DVD that tells you what I do.&nbsp; Do you have a DVD player?&nbsp; Look, I only have a few of these, I've got more coming; but could you look at this in the next few days and I can get back with you? Where can I contact you in a couple of days.&nbsp; There's my contact number on the back.&nbsp; Give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks.

<TD>Hello, 
<BR>My name is Paul Jeter. I currently reside in Muncie, Indiana. I am originally from Louisiana. I operated PJ's Air Conditioning and Appliance Sales, Service and Parts for over 30 years. Because of the economic downturn after 15 years in business, I moved my A/C business to West Palm Beach, Florida in 1984. I was very successful for the next 15 years. In 1997, an EcoQuest manager called my store and introduced my partner to Living Air Classic. We bought it, joined the company and for four years shared the technology with our customers. In 2001 I walked away from a life long a/c trade to commit full time to the mission of EcoQuest International.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>For over 30 years I provided a service and was paid very well to solve people’s problems with their air conditioning and appliances. I charged people money and provided an ongoing service. With EcoQuest I teach people how to improve their lives by providing financial solutions and solving their air, water, and nutritional pollution problems.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>I love to travel and I love to dance to country and rock and roll music. EcoQuest is a perfect fit. Now when I travel and go dancing in cities all over the United States, and Internationally, I am networking and dancing all the way to the bank. Yeeeee Ha! I am having the time of my life. People that I help by introducing them to the EcoQuest lifestyle become my friends for life.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>With PJ's Appliance I solved people's problems for the moment; with EcoQuest I solve people’s problems for life. All my problems are being solved by my association with EcoQuest. Mike Jackson, our CEO, says, "EcoQuest isn't everything, but it is something."&nbsp; I believe that at my age of 55, EcoQuest is the best opportunity I have to secure my future within the short time frame that I find myself, as I'm looking for security in retirement. I love the freedom and financial security and the planned lifestyle that EcoQuest provides for my future.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>I worked long and hard hours providing service to my business and my customers for many years. Two things I didn't care for as a business owner- I never had much freedom to enjoy the fruits of my labor and too many people had their hands in my pocket. For over 30 years I process over a million dollars through my company accounts.&nbsp; Over the years my overhead expenses inflated more than I could charge to keep pace. So many activities cost me money that I had no control over. My personal liability with buildings and employees sometime made me just want to run away. With EcoQuest, I still work long hours, I still deal with people, I still solve problems but I have no stress and I can enjoy the fruit of my labors everyday. I use to work my life around my business, now I work my business around my life.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>I had a dream after college to be my own boss, to make a million dollars, and retire by age forty.&nbsp; I tried to be my own boss, I made a million dollars, but I didn't get to retire. I now have a renewed dream. With EcoQuest I can buy a very expensive diesel pusher motor home and travel, go dancing everyday if I want to, and visit every major city in the United States. While I'm there I might as well recruit a Master Manager type leader person. Maybe my trip can be paid for by the IRS. It took me 30 years to make a million dollars of which I didn't get to keep. My dream with EcoQuest is to make 10 million dollars in the next 10 years. I bet if you ask Mike Jackson, and he knows me, I bet he would say it is very possible. Bob Giddens, my mentor, will [make it], and he will teach me how to also.</TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD>I recommend every dealer do what I first did when I joined the ETN last year. Do every course related to motivation. A "little" knowledge is a dangerous thing; but a "little" motivation goes a long way and it becomes contagious. Mitchell Tolle says, "It does require a lot of skill to change your mind." If you can control your mind, you can control your life. With ETN you can control your mind and also learn the skill that will bring you life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness we call FREEDOM.</TD>
