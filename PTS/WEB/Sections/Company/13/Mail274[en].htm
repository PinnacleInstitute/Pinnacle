<BR>John,
<P>Hello, you probably do not remember me but I was trying to join the club months ago but I got so busy that I can not do it anymore. I will try doing it again next month, when is the next meeting anyway?
<P>John, I will be sending you an email regarding the awesome business that I am doing right now. If I can show you how you can make $120,000+ a year, would you give me 30 minutes of your time to listen, just listen to the presentation? I am looking for serious business minded people who are coachable and have the desire to&nbsp; succeed.
<P>Give me a call...
<P>Leo Sy
