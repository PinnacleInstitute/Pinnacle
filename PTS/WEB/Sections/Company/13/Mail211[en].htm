Susan,
<P>We received notice that you visited our website on Friday.&nbsp; When I tried to call you today at the contact number, a man answered and said it was a wrong number.&nbsp; If you are still interested in learning more about our opportunity, please email with a better number and a good time to call.&nbsp; Or you can ask any questions by email at this time.
<P>Kim
