<BR>Good Morning Krystal,
<P>It was nice talking to you on Friday!&nbsp; As I mentioned, I will be sending you some brochures on our products for both the company and for your own personal use.&nbsp; The new catalogues are in print to reflect the latest products announced at our convention.&nbsp; As soon as they are completed, I will send you a few.&nbsp; 
<P>The balance of this email is intended for Jerry.&nbsp; Please forward it on to him, since I do not have his email address.&nbsp; Krystal, thank you again for your help and I will keep in contact!

<P>Good Morning Jerry,
<P>Thank you so much for your order!&nbsp; Your FreshAir air purification unit should arrive via UPS this morning.&nbsp; Since I am not there in person, I would like to introduce you to some of the features and give you some instruction to setting it up.

<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The machine has 2 buttons for setting Ozone that contain 3 distinct settings.&nbsp; The first button (bottom left hand side) has “normal” and “high”.&nbsp; The second button is on the bottom right hand side, and says “away mode”.&nbsp; Ozone is the basic substance that will kill bacteria and germs in the air and neutralize odors.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /></FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">If the display indicates “NORMAL” it is in the lowest setting and little Ozone is being emitted.</FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">If the Normal/High button is pushed again, the word “<?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" />NORMAL” disappears and a simple graph is displayed.&nbsp; This is the high mode.</FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">The purifier up/down buttons indicated the desired square footage the machine should be purifying.</FONT>

<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">If odors are strong, it will take higher levels of Ozone to neutralize them and to purify the room.</FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">Thus when people and pets are absent from the premise, the “Away” mode should be utilized, initially for an 8 hour period.&nbsp; To accomplish this,&nbsp; push the “Away” mode four times, and ascertain that the display indicates 8.0.</FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">At the end of eight hours, the unit will revert back to the setting it was on before the “Away” mode was initialized, i.e. either “Normal” or “High”</FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">If the smell is a strong chlorine-like odor, the area&nbsp; has been well sanitized and the unit may be turned down to more acceptable levels.&nbsp; This is accomplished by (a) going from “high” to “normal” by pushing the left button until “Normal” appears in the display, or (b) reducing the “purifier” button to a lower square foot level, or (c) use the away mode for times less than 8 hours 2,4, and 6 are available, or (d) a combination of the above.</FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman">No two situations will be exactly alike, and no exact formula can be provided.&nbsp; The range of purification would go from a low setting of “Normal”/250 to “Away”/3000, with “High”/1500 being somewhere in the middle. It is up to the user to find their own comfort zone.</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Initially, insert the batteries into the remote.&nbsp; Insert the power cord&nbsp;firmly in to the back of the unit.&nbsp; Place the unit on the highest location in the room making sure it is level and has enough room behind for proper ventilation.&nbsp; I usually anglel the unit caddy corner so it is aimed at the largest part of the area to be covered.&nbsp; For today, I would set the bottom left button to "normal" and the top right button to a low to medium fan setting.&nbsp; This gives you a chance to become familiar with the unit and the delicious sweet "thunderstorm fresh" scent produced by the ionization process.&nbsp; To address the odor you mentioned previously, tonight before you leave,(providing the room will remain unoccupied), press the away mode button until you reach 8 hours (or less if you work late), set the purification button to 3000 s/f and set the fan at the highest setting.&nbsp; Tomorrow you should notice a drastic change in the room.&nbsp; If the odor is not completely gone, you can repeat the process that night.&nbsp; If your room is small, I would leave the setting on normal and if you want to set it on high, set it for no more than 250 s/f&nbsp;or whatever you feel the square footage is.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT>&nbsp;
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">Have fun with the unit!&nbsp; You can even take it home and sanitize your home... your bed and linens to kill the dust mites (UGH!!)... leave the FreshAir running in the closet to&nbsp;freshen suits and shoes...the list is endless!!</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"></FONT>&nbsp;
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">I will be calling you later in the day to see&nbsp;how everything is and also please feel free to call me at 407-339-1910.&nbsp; I would also like to remind you to register your unit.&nbsp; Open the Owners Manual to page 5.&nbsp; Please enter my name in the dealer spot and record your serial#.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also find a registration card there which you need to complete and&nbsp;return to EcoQuest.&nbsp; This guarantees your warranty.</FONT>
