<BR>Hello Marty,
<P>Hi my name is Nicole Day. I have recently discovered the Ecoquest Success Network and I love it. &nbsp;Not only is it chock full of vital training, product and company information, but with new features such as 800# and email templates being added as soon as August I am sure that it is the right thing to pass on to my downline. Best of all it is inexpensive, especially when you refer 5 people.&nbsp; I am currently trying to take as many tests and assesments as possible and set a schedule for myself and my business. My direct upline&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;many of my team members are unfamiliar with this wonderful tool.&nbsp; I have been unsuccessful at finding a mentor to help me with this. As my training buddy are you available to be a mentor to me on the success network? I know this will probally take up some of your valuable time and I know I am not your direct downline. If you see yourself being able to take on this task or if you know a reference that would be as qualified as well as willing to do so,&nbsp;please let me know. I would be truly greatful.
<P>Yours in Success
<P>Nicole Day
