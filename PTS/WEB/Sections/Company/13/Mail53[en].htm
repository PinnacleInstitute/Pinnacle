<BR>Hello Danna,
<P>I recieved your email and it sounds like you have a full schedule. As well that you value you time with your family. That is exactly what attracted me to Ecoquest in the first place. I was working 50hrs per week with an additional 3hrs commute daily to work and home. During the week I hardly saw my family. After&nbsp;4 months&nbsp;with Ecoquest I fired my boss and went to work fulltime for my self. As you know it is&nbsp;summer&nbsp;now, and&nbsp;I have enjoyed&nbsp;this summer especially. I have been able to work a successful business and at the&nbsp;same time be home with my children who would have had to go to daycare or a&nbsp; summer program while I was at work. I encourage you to take a good look at our company and make an informed descision about your time and willingness to start a business. Take a look at what ecoquest is all about <A href="http://www.realhomebasedincomesolutions.com/">www.realhomebasedincomesolutions.com&nbsp;&nbsp;</A>&nbsp;If this looks like the kind of business that you want to be a part of then submit you&nbsp;name and number and the best time&nbsp;for me to reach you. We can set up an interview and go from there.
<P>Yours in Success
<P>Nicole&nbsp;Day&nbsp;
