<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Q: Do I need to refer 5 new members each month to receive my membership at no cost? 
<BR>A: No.&nbsp; Simply maintain your referrals.&nbsp; As long your referrals maintain a Professional membership you will receive credit towards your free membership. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Q: If one of my five referrals downgrades to a Basic membership or cancels their membership, will I be billed? 
<BR>A: Yes.&nbsp; If you have less then five Professional membership referrals when your free month ends, you will be billed for your membership.&nbsp; We recommend you refer more than five to ensure you will not be billed if one of your referrals changes their membership status. </FONT>
