<BR>Hello Anna,
<P>I got your email...Sorry I have been very busy this past weekend...We spent almost the whole weekend on the boat and working around the house...I did get your email and&nbsp; I thought it said that you would not be able to check your email...But to answer your question...Yes I will still be your coach/mentor...Let me ask you this..Would you be interested in trying out the water purifier? Or the laundry pure? I would feel more comfortable with you representing a product that you believe in and are happy with?
<BR>I have one of the 3 stage water purifiers here that I can send you...I just love mine...I have had a very good response from the water purifiers...I just signed on a pretty large plumbing company in the area to sell the water purifiers...He is very excited and will be attending a meeting with me this weekend in Orlando...That is another fantastic thing about EcoQuest, they are always having meetings and guest speakers that really motivate people to get started....I will look for the package to come and let me know about the water or the laundry pure...You can go to <A href="http://www.soapfreelaundry.com/">www.soapfreelaundry.com </A>&nbsp;if you are not sure what the laundry pure is...I think in this instance we should discuss other options for getting you going...Let me know when you will be back home and when a good time to get together for a quick phone call...I am thinking Thursday Evening??? Let me know...
<BR>
<BR>Talk to you soon
<P>Nicole Day
