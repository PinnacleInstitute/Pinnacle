<P><B>How do I print a certificate? </B>
<P>After you complete all the lessons for your class you will have the option to print a certificate from the class page. Click the "Print Certificate" button to confirm your name as you would like it to appear on the certificate. A "Print Dialog Box" is displayed for you to select the desired printer. If you pass the optional quiz, you will be able to print a "Certificate of Achievement": otherwise you will be able to print a "Certificate of Completion". 
<P><B>How do I view the Certificate before I print it? </B>
<P>Pinnacle automatically starts the printing process after you confirm your name as it should appear on the certificate, by displaying the "Print Dialog Box". Cancel this Dialog Box and select the "File / Print Preview" menu option to view the certificate before printing. 
<P><B>What do I do if I get a downloading error when printing a certificate? </B>
<P>Pinnacle downloads an Active X control to automatically set the printing formatting options for the certificate. If you have a problem downloading this file, you can manually set the printing options. On the "Printing Certificate..." page, cancel the "Print Dialog Box" and select the "File / Page Setup" menu option. Remove the header and footer information, select the "Landscape" orientation, and set all margins to 1/2 inch. Select the "File / Print" or "File / Print Preview" menu option to print the certificate. 
<P><B>How do I print a framable certificate? </B>
<P>Pinnacle certificates are printed with a 1/2-inch margin on an 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper. This will frame nicely in a 8 1/2 x 11 frame or an 8 x 10 frame. If you would like the certificate to center exactly in an 8 x 10 frame, set the left and right margins to .75 inches by selecting the "File / Page Setup" menu option in your browser. 
<P><B>How do I print a good quality certificate? </B>
<P>For best printing results, use a color printer and bright white card stock paper (80 - 110 lb.). You may also try printing on light colored paper like a nice parchment stock. These special papers can be purchased at any office supply store. 
<P><B>How do I contact Pinnacle with questions or comments? </B>
<P>Please feel free to contact the Pinnacle Performance Institute with any questions, comments, or suggestions.
