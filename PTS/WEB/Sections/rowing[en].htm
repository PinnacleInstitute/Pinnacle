<P><FONT size=3>May I share with you some thoughts on the power of learning and its relation to self-reliance? The Lord gave important instructions to seek balanced learning. The terms in the scriptures are study and faith. For example,&nbsp;the Lord invites us: “Seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.”</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>To me, the terms learning by study and learning by faith say that self-reliance comes from both efforts.&nbsp; We need to cultivate both of them.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Let me give you an example. Suppose you want to know how the human body works. Faith tells us that our bodies were created through an inspired process, that they were made in the image of our Heavenly Parents, that we have a stewardship over them to keep them sacred and healthy during our mortal probation, and that we will reclaim them as perfect after the resurrection. That is the message of faith. That’s like one oar on a boat.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>But to understand their workings—whether an illness is caused by a chemical imbalance or through a fever, how to set a broken bone properly, or how to replace an improperly functioning valve in the heart by surgery—that requires intense and detailed study. Study is the other oar by which we can seek and obtain knowledge.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>What happens if you try to paddle a boat using only one oar? You go around and around in circles. If you paddle hard, you go fast. If you paddle slowly, you turn gently. But you still just go around in circles. It’s the same with trying to make study replace faith or trying to exercise faith but without study. We can often find ourselves just going around in circles. I think that the Holy Ghost cannot give us some answers until we are actively seeking knowledge.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Think what great progress has been made in medicine by those who use both oars in their training. For example,&nbsp;Russell M. Nelson used both oars in his former profession as a heart surgeon. With the trained skills of his hands, the knowledge stored in his mind from his study and his experience, and the faith in his heart that he would be sustained by the Holy Ghost as he operated, he has performed modern miracles that have spared the lives and prolonged the vigor and energy of so many people, including Presidents of the Church and many General Authorities. If he had relied only on faith, he still would have been a great man, but he would not have been a great surgeon. If he had relied only on study, he might have been a great surgeon, but I think there are many assignments that the Lord would not have entrusted to him.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>It is the same with us. Each of us&nbsp;needs to develop both gifts, the gift of faith and the gift of study, to the utmost of our capacity. We need to exercise both study and faith to become self-reliant. We need to understand their relationship to each other and to us.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>There are many kinds of self-reliance. As we work toward self-reliance, we should prepare ourselves in the following areas: education; health; employment; home storage; resource management; and social, emotional, and spiritual strength. Let’s look at one aspect of self-reliance—employment—and see how learning by both study and faith relates to this topic.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>We have faith in our prophets. They have counseled us that mothers with young children are especially needed at home. They remind us of the great needs of our children and their vulnerabilities during their growing years. The importance of the mother in building a secure, loving, stimulating environment in which children can grow up as healthy and self-reliant individuals is very important. The ideal family for raising children, we believe, is a stable, loving, two-parent family where young children receive full-time parenting.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>But not all situations are ideal. Not all women are mothers, and not all mothers have children at home. Furthermore, not all mothers can make the choice to be home with their children all of the time. Often circumstances constrain their choices. At other times, other responsibilities and opportunities require that difficult decisions be made. Women and families will be happier with these decisions if they are made using both study and faith.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Each year it becomes increasingly important for women to improve their abilities to take care of themselves and their children economically, if circumstances should require it.&nbsp; There are impelling reasons for women to plan toward employment.&nbsp; If they become widowed or divorced and need to work, we want them to have dignified and rewarding employment.&nbsp; If anything, it&nbsp;has become even more relevant in the almost twenty years that have passed as the national economy has made it increasingly difficult for one wage to support a family, as more mothers are left alone to raise their children, and as more women spend lengthy portions of their lives single. He is telling all of us to use the oar of study to prepare ourselves professionally for worthy and rewarding activities, including paid employment.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>We need to keep growing. Part of our mortal responsibility is to increase in learning and wisdom. We need to use the two oars of study and faith so that our boats will not be swamped by the storms of life. We need to teach our children to use these same oars. Let’s encourage them to value education and to increase in learning and wisdom through study and faith.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Some of you may feel that your chance to gain more learning has passed you by. It is not so. You can learn at any age. No one individual has enough power to control all of their life circumstances, but they can meet those circumstances with confidence if&nbsp;they have the appropriate tools and trusts themselves to use them properly.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>I have been a lifelong learner, and I love the things I learn each day about the wonders of the world we live in. The promise of eternal progression is a thrilling one to me as I look forward to an eternity of learning. Let us trust both study and faith to keep us going straight, instead of around in circles.
