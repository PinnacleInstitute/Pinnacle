<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">You can deduct expenses
that are &#8220;ordinary&#8221; and &#8220;necessary&#8221; for your trade, business or
profession. An &#8220;ordinary&#8221; expense is one that is common and accepted in
your specific trade or profession and a &#8220;necessary&#8221; expense is one that
is helpful and appropriate. This is true whether you are a W-2 employee
working for someone else or are self-employed, either as a sole
proprietor reporting income and expenses on Schedule C of Form 1040, a
partner in a partnership which files Form 1065, or an employee of your
own &#8220;one-man&#8221; corporation filing either Form 1120 or Form 1120S.<br><br>If
you attend conferences and seminars, meet with clients or do some
other&nbsp; business-related travel on behalf of your home business, it
is tax deductible. However, you do have to be careful. You can only
deduct expenses related to your business &#8212; no deductions for
site-seeing. Additionally, you can&#8217;t deduct expenses for your family,
if you bring them along. You should also make sure to document the
trip, and keep good records. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="3">The following are examples of

		<div align="left"><br><p><font face="Verdana" size="3">A trip that is primarily for business
          can be deducted 100%.&nbsp; This means that more than half of your
          time was spent on business.&nbsp; Travel days are counted as business
          days.&nbsp; A log of daily activities and business contacts are
          important to document these expenses.&nbsp; The percentage of time you
          spend doing "business" on your trip is very important.&nbsp;
          Also remember a "Day" is considered to be four hours or more
          doing business.&nbsp; Travel on cruise ships has limitations.&nbsp;
          Different rules apply for travel taken outside the U.S.&nbsp; Please
          consult Publication 463 - Travel, Entertainment, and Gift expenses at <a href="http://www.irs.gov">www.irs.gov</a>
