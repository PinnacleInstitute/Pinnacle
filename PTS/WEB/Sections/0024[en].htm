<FONT face=Arial color=saddlebrown size=2>
<P><BR><B>Overview</B>
<FONT face=Arial color=black size=2>
<P>Hundreds of new network marketing companies start up every year and the vast majority fails within the first 12 – 18 months.  Why do so many fail and more importantly how do the successful companies stay around for many years.  The number one reason for these failures is mismanagement. Most network marketing companies are started by individuals that have experienced some success as a distributor.  The transformation from distributor to corporate executive is usually disastrous.

<BR>The following three 
            fundamental cornerstones of Management, Product, and Compensation Plan must be in place for a network marketing company to flourish for the long-term.  An individual seeking an income opportunity in network marketing should carefully analyze these to insure that their emotional, financial and time investment is not wasted.
