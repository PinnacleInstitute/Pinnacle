<P align=left>Would you like to —substantially increase </FONT>—your compatibility with other people? Can you imagine the ways this might benefit you in your career, your day-to-day dealings with people, and in your closest personal relationships? 
<P align=left>Our characteristic styles or patterns of relating to others determine the ease with which we build relationships. Most of our behavior patterns are established early in life through the influence of peers, education, parents, authority figures, and environment. Through our lives, a variety of behavior patterns are reinforced and become habits. 
<P align=left>While our habits make us fairly predictable, everyone has different habits. That’s what keeps relationships interesting and challenging!</FONT><I><FONT face=Times-Italic> 
<P align=left>The Platinum Rule™ </I></FONT><FONT face=Times-Roman>assembles a number of simple tools that can be easily applied to improve both business and interpersonal relationships. This handbook is not intended to provide an in-depth psychological examination of human behavior, but instead, offers guidelines for understanding and adjusting to the differences in people, through observation of their behavior. The tools presented here will enable you to see yourself and your world through someone else’s eyes and ears, and that can go a long way toward building compatibility!</FONT><I><FONT face=Times-Italic> 
<P align=left>The Platinum Rule™ </I></FONT><FONT face=Times-Roman>will show you how to "Do unto others the way they </FONT><B><FONT face=Times-Bold>want </B></FONT><FONT face=Times-Roman>and </FONT><B><FONT face=Times-Bold>need </B></FONT><FONT face=Times-Roman>you to do unto them" by teaching you to: 
<P align=left>• UNDERSTAND THAT although each individual’s personality is as unique as his or her thumbprint, many behaviors can be positioned within a systematic, predictable framework. 
<P align=left>• IDENTIFY how a person’s behavioral patterns influence what that person wants, needs and expects from you and others; and how that person communicates those wants, needs and expectations. People will actually tell you how to deal with them if you know what to listen and look for. 
<P align=left>• ADAPT to people in a way that will reduce tension and increase cooperation and trust in all varieties of relationships. 
<P align=left>It is my belief that people will show you, actually teach you, how they prefer to be treated if you will listen to what they have to say, watch what they do, and be willing to accommodate possible differences between their styles and your own. It’s not hard! And the rewards—in terms of productive, trusting relationships—can be substantial in many areas of your life.</FONT>
