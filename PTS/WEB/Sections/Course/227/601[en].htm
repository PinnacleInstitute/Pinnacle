<H3><A name=1>What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>OCD is a real illness that can be treated with medicine and therapy. When you have OCD, you have recurring, upsetting thoughts (called <I> obsessions</I> ). You repeat doing the same thing, over and over again (called <I> compulsions</I> ) to make the thoughts go away. And, you feel like you can't control or stop these thoughts or actions. The obsessions, or upsetting thoughts, can include things like a fear of germs, a fear of being hurt, a fear of hurting others, and disturbing religious or sexual thoughts. The compulsions, or actions you repeat to make the thoughts go away, can be things like counting, cleaning, hand washing, and checking on things. While these actions provide only short-lived relief, not doing them only increases anxiety. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Many people who have OCD know that their actions often don't make sense. They may try to hide their problem from family and friends, and may have trouble keeping a job because of their actions. Without treatment, obsessions and the need to perform rituals can take over a person's life. OCD is an <I> <B>anxiety disorder</B></I>  that can be life-long. A person with OCD can also recover and then get the illness again, or relapse. This illness affects women and men in equal numbers. Most often, OCD begins during the teenage years or early childhood, although it can start in an adult. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The exact cause of OCD is not known. Researchers are looking at differences in brain activity among people who have OCD and persons who do not, for clues about it's cause. OCD is not caused by family problems. Nor is it caused by something in a person's childhood, such as an unusual focus on cleanliness, or a belief that certain thoughts are dangerous or wrong. It's important to know that when a person has OCD, it's not her or his fault. And, it's not something a person can just "snap out of."</FONT>
