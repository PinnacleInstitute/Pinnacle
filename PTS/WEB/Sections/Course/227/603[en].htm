<H3><A name=3>What should I do if I think I have OCD? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>If you think you may have symptoms of OCD, a visit to your doctor is the best place to start. Your doctor will perform a careful exam to figure out whether your symptoms are really due to this illness, or if you have another anxiety disorder or problem. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Sometimes a person can feel awkward talking to a health care provider about OCD. They may blame themselves, think their condition is not serious, or feel embarrassed. Keep in mind that this illness can be treated. Be aware that all anxiety disorders are not treated the same. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The next step your doctor may suggest is a visit with a mental health professional. This includes <B>psychiatrists</B>, <B>psychologists</B>, <B>social workers</B>, and <B>counselors</B>. It is best to look for a professional who has special training in cognitive-behavioral and/or behavioral therapy. Try to find someone who is open to the use of medications, should they be needed. And if they are not a medical doctor, be sure they work with one so medication can be prescribed. Keep in mind that when you start taking medicine, it may not start working right away. You need to give your body a few weeks to get used to the medicine. Then, you and your doctor can decide if it's working. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>It's very important that you feel comfortable with your treatment. If this is not the case, seek help elsewhere. If you've been taking medication, don't stop it all of a sudden. These drugs need to be tapered off slowly, under the care of your doctor. Talk with your doctor about how to stop the medication you're taking.</FONT>
