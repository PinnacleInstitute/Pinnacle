<H3><A name=4>How is OCD treated? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>OCD is a type of anxiety disorder, the most common of all the mental disorders. Many people misunderstand these disorders and think people should be able to overcome the symptoms by sheer willpower. But, the symptoms can't be willed or wished away. There are treatments, developed through research, that work well for these disorders. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Anxiety disorders are treated in two ways - with medication and with certain types of <B>psychotherapy</B> (sometimes called "talk therapy"). Sometimes only one treatment is used or both treatments are combined. If you have an anxiety disorder, talk with your doctor about what will work best for you. If you do choose psychotherapy, make sure the therapist is able to provide you with medication, if needed. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>A number of drugs used for treating depression, called <I> <B>antidepressants</B></I> , have been found to help with anxiety disorders as well. <I> Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</I>  (MAOIs) are used, along with the newer <I> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</I>  (SSRIs). Other medicines include anti-anxiety drugs called <I> benzodiazepines</I>  and <I> beta-blockers</I> . </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Treatment with psychotherapy includes <I> cognitive-behavioral therapy</I>  (CBT) and <I> behavioral therapy</I> . In CBT, the goal is to change how a person thinks about, and then reacts to, a situation that makes them anxious or fearful. In behavioral therapy, the focus is on changing how a person reacts to a situation. CBT or behavioral therapy most often lasts for 12 weeks. It can be group or individual therapy. A special type of behavior therapy, called <I> exposure and response prevention</I> , is often used with OCD. With this approach, a person is exposed to whatever triggers the obsessive thoughts. Then, the person is taught ways to avoid doing the compulsive rituals, and how to deal with the anxiety. Some studies have shown that the benefits of CBT or behavioral therapy last longer than do those of medications for people with OCD. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Keep in mind that it can be a challenge to find the right treatment for an anxiety disorder. But, if one treatment doesn't work, the odds are good that another one will. Your doctor and therapist will work together to help you find the best approach. New treatments are being developed through ongoing research. So, don't give up hope. If you have recovered from an anxiety disorder and it comes back at a later date, don't think that you've failed. You can be treated again. And, the skills you learned dealing with the disorder the first time can help you in coping with it again.</FONT>
