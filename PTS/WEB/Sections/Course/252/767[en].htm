<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>When your debts are high and your monthly income is not enough to cover the payments, the Federal Bankruptcy Code offers two solutions as the last resort. Your debts will be settled by selling your assets when filing bankruptcy. Under the wage-earner's plan you may keep your assets while paying back your debts.
<P>The road to financial recovery takes a total commitment. You have to decide that you want to be free of debt, then discipline yourself to take the needed action. Only you can determine if the last resort solution offered by bankruptcy will help.
