<H3 align=center>Choosing an Attorney</H3>
<P>If you choose to use Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, you will need to hire an attorney. Try to find an attorney who has experience in handling Chapter 7 if you choose to file bankruptcy. Choose an attorney who has experience in handling Chapter 13 (the wage-earner's plan) if you choose to go that route. Some attorneys may handle Chapter 7 and know little about Chapter 13 and vice versa. Select your attorney carefully.
