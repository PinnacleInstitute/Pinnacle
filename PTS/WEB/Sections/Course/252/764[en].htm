<P>When all other alternatives for dealing with too many debts fail, the Federal Bankruptcy Code provides consumers with two forms of debtor relief. Chapter 7 of the code is the straight bankruptcy provision and provides for liquidation (convert into cash) of the debtor's assets. Under Chapter 7, the secured creditors may have the security turned over to them unless the debtor reaffirms the debt with the court's approval. With bankruptcy under Chapter 7, you give up the property you put up for collateral when using credit unless the debts are reaffirmed by court permission and you continue to pay the creditor. With Chapter 13 you promise to pay existing debts with part of the income you will earn in the next few years. While paying the debts, you will be able to keep things you bought on credit if your plan is approved by the courts.
