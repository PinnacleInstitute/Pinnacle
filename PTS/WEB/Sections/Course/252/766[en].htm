<H3 align=center>Chapter 13-Wage-Earner's Plan</H3>
<P>Chapter 13 or the wage-earner's plan is a voluntary repayment plan. When you complete the plan you have the satisfaction of keeping your assets, paying your creditors, and discharging your debts.
<P>When filing Chapter 13 you agree to pay approximately 25 percent of your income to the court. The court appoints a trustee to handle your money and pay your debts. The trustee also provides advice and counsel when necessary.
<P>To file Chapter 13; contact an attorney who has experience in filing Chapter 13 petitions. Next:

<LI>The attorney will file the petition with the Federal court. A court-appointed trustee is responsible for reviewing the petition, confirming the petition, paying the debts, and advising and counseling the debtor. 
<LI>The court clerk will send notice of court action to creditors and the employer. 
<LI>The employer sends a portion of your pay check to the court trustee, who pays creditors. Secured debts are paid first, followed by unsecured debts. 
<LI>The debtor cannot borrow more money without approval of the court trustee.

<P>The actual amount of money paid creditors depends on the amount owed, the debtor's salary, and the payback time frame. Chapter 13 payment plans may not be proposed for longer than 36 months unless you can show reason for extending the plan. The maximum time allowed is 5 years.
<P>Administrative costs may be high. They include the court costs, filing fee, the attorney's fee, and the trustee's fee for paying off the debts. The trustee also may receive a fee for expenses such as typing equipment and supplies.
<P>There are several advantages to filing Chapter 13 despite the expense. You do not lose your assets. The court protects you from wage garnishment and harassment. All debts are finally discharged though this court provision will remain on record at the credit bureau for 7 years.
