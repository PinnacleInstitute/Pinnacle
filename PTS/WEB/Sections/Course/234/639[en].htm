<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>To decide how many hours you need to study each week to get A's, use this rule of thumb. <B>"Study two hours per hour in class for a lighter class, three hours per hour in class for an average class, and four hours per hour in class for a difficult class"</B>. For example, basket weaving may be a relatively light 3-hour class. Usually, a person would not do more than 6 hours of work outside class per week. Advanced calculus is usually considered a difficult class, so it might be best to study the proposed 12 hours a week. If more hours are needed, take away some hours from lighter classes, i.e., basket weaving. Using your current classes, fill in the following to determine the time you need for study.</FONT><FORM name=study>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>Compare this number to your time left from the personal time survey. If you are like many students, you might find you are a bit stressed by the comparison. To ease your anxiety, remember it is not only the <B>quantity</B> of study time but also the <B>quality</B>. The formula is a general guideline. Try following it for a week, and make adjustments as needed.</FONT>
