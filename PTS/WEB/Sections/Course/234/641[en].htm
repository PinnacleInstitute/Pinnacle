<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>Now that you know how you spend most of your time, look at it. Think about what are your most important activities. Do you have enough time? Chances are that you do not. Below are some tips on how to schedule and budget your time when it seems you just do not have enough.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000><I><FONT color=#336699 size=3>Do not be a perfectionist</FONT></I></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>Trying to be a perfect person sets you up for defeat. Nobody can be totally perfect. Difficult tasks usually result in avoidance and procrastination. Perfectionists tend to avoid rather than attempt. You need to set achievable goals, but they should also be challenging. Break difficult tasks into manageable chunks. Don't be afraid to fail. Be willing to "endeavor"!</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000><I><FONT color=#336699 size=3>Learn to say "NO"</FONT></I></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>For example, an acquaintance of yours would like you to see a movie with him/her tonight. You made social plans for tomorrow with your friends and tonight you were going to study and do laundry. You really are not interested. You want to say no, but you hate turning people down. Politely saying "no" should become a habit. Saying "no" frees up time for the things that are most important and helps you feel in control.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000><I><FONT color=#336699 size=3>Learn to set priorities</FONT></I></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>Setting priorities for your responsibilities and commitments is very important. Some people do not know how to set priorities and become procrastinators. Using a "to-do list" places items in order of importance. One method is the ABC list. This list is divided into three sections; A, B, or C. The items placed in the A section are those needed to be done that day. The items placed in the B section need completion within the week. The C section items are those things that need to be done within the month. As the B and C items become more pertinent, they are bumped up to the A or B list. Try it or come up with your own method, but do something to set priorities.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000><I><FONT color=#336699 size=3>Combine several activities</FONT></I></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>Another suggestion is to combine several activities into one time slot. While commuting to school, listen to taped notes. This allows up to an hour or two a day of good study review. While showering, make a mental list of the things that need to be done. When you watch T.V., shine your shoes or write letters, etc. These are just suggestions of what you can do to combine your time. There are other ideas you may want to try. Above all, be creative and let time work for you.</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>After scheduling becomes a habit, you can adjust your schedule. It's better to be precise at first. It is easier to find something to do with extra time than to find extra time to do something. Most importantly, make it work for you. A time schedule that is not personalized and honest is not a time schedule at all.</FONT>
