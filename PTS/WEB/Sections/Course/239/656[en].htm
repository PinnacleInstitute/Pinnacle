<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000" size=3>As mentioned above there are many different names of software for both the Macintosh and Windows 95 computer. These include Microsoft Word, ClarisWorks, Word Perfect, WordPad, AppleWorks, etc. Typing skills make using all of them easier, of course, but not necessary. Even somebody who <I>hunts and pecks</I> all of their keys will still actually type faster than writing by hand. Therefore you need not worry about being able to type faster than your boss can talk. </FONT>

<LI><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000" size=3>To start, open up your word processor. This is usually done by single or double clicking on the icon of the software. </FONT>
<LI><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000" size=3>When the software has loaded, it already has opened a blank document to start with. You can now start typing right away. To indent at the start of a paragraph, use the <B>tab</B> key instead of the space bar. The space bar may look alright on the screen, but will look sloppy when printing your document out. </FONT>

<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000" size=3>Since this letter is being typed using Microsoft Word from Office 97, it will underline in red any words that the software does not recognize. This feature can be turned off, or you can ignore it (most software do not do this anyway). The red lines will not appear when printing on paper. Later in this handout you will be shown how to use the spell checking tools. </FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000" size=3>You should also notice that the text that you are typing automatically scrolls to the next line. You do not have to hit <B>Return</B> or <B>Enter</B> at the end of each line. The only time you should hit <B>Enter</B> or <B>Return</B> is at the end of a paragraph.

<LI><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ff0000"><FONT size=3>Continue to type your paragraph and hit enter or return at the end. Hit tab to indent your next paragraph and continue to type.</FONT></FONT>
