<P><FONT size=3>The spell checker is a great tool to have on a word processor, but it is not perfect. It only looks at every word that you typed, one at a time, and checks it with a dictionary. It does not look at each word in its context. Therefore if you typed <B><I>their</I></B> when you really wanted the word <B><I>there</I></B>, it will not correct the mistake. This means that you will still have to proof read your document yourself. 
<BR>&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Unlike all of the features explained before, the spell checking tool is not in the same place for all software. It is often found in the <B>Edit</B> menu or the <B>Tools</B> menu. In this case (Microsoft Word) it is in the <B>Tools</B> menu. So we click on the <B>Tools</B> menu and slide down to <B>Spelling and Grammar…</B>. </FONT><CENTER><FONT size=3><IMG height=145 src="http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/alummis/beginnerword/Image81.gif" width=235></FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT size=3>A spell check window pops up. Depending upon your software, you may have to click on a button that says <B>Start</B>. In this case we do not have to, it starts spell checking right away. When it finds a word that it does not recognize, it will show you and also give some alternative suggestions. If the word is spelled correct (spell checking does not usually recognize names as an example) then click on <B>Ignore</B>, or <B>Ignore</B> <B>All</B>. If it is misspelled, click on the correct word in the suggestions, and then click on <B>Change</B>. <B>Do not</B> click on the <B>Add</B> button, or in some cases the <B>Learn</B> button, as this will add the misspelled word to the computer's dictionary. </FONT><CENTER><FONT size=3><IMG height=261 src="http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/alummis/beginnerword/Image82.gif" width=459></FONT></CENTER><CENTER><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></CENTER>

<P><FONT size=3>When it has finished checking all of the words you have typed, it will usually let you know. Click on <B>OK</B>, or in some cases <B>Done</B>. </FONT><CENTER><IMG height=108 src="http://www.compusmart.ab.ca/alummis/beginnerword/Image83.gif" width=230></CENTER>
