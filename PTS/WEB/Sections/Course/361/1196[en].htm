Rhythm 
<P>In order to create a rhythm we need to understand what it means and to do this we have to look at the central driving force behind music, the pulse. If you think of your heart beat being central and vital to your life, then the pulse has the same role in a piece of music and without it, the music will fall apart. 
<P>Like your pulse, a music pulse is a constant steady beat - think of musicians tapping their foot, the conductor moving the baton, the role of drums in a rock band and you get the idea. Can a pulse change speed? Well if you are running your pulse is faster than if you were asleep but in either instance the pulse itself is steady - fast and steady or slow and steady but it doesn't mix up the two to create irregular fast and slow - that would be rhythm. 
<P>So in music, a pulse is another word for a beat and it means a steady constant - fast, slow or in the middle but the crucial word here is constant. 
<P>A rhythm is a pattern of beats, some fast, some slow and some in the middle and the crucial word here is pattern - the opposite of constant. 
<P>Exercise: Try tapping your foot/hand or nodding your head to a steady pulse. When you are doing that&nbsp;to a regular, steady beat, try singing/humming/tapping the other foot/hand to a rhythm - a good way of doing this is to think of a sports chant, a simple song, a hymn or anything that you know well. Here is my example using Jingle Bells as my rhythm:

<P>Can you see that the syllables of "jingle" each have a pulse whilst "bells" has only one syllable but has two pulses because&nbsp;"bells" in this&nbsp;instance is&nbsp;a long word. &nbsp;Likewise the word "way" has four pulses because in this instance the word "way" is very long.&nbsp; 
<P>Now look at the trickiest bit which is an introduction to syncopation. Syncopation means to be off the beat ie the pulse happens before the word starts. In the above example syncopation occurs between the words "fun it is". There is a pulse on the word "fun" and "is" but on the word "it" the pulse falls before the word. Why do this? Well syncopation adds rhythmic interest and is a tool that helps to push the music forwards. Here it mimics the idea of fun - spontaneous and exciting with rushed air of expectancy. 
<P>We've talked about long words and short words in the above example but how do we create long and short words? Well we need to use a form of notation that tells us about duration. We need to look at the notes that give us this information with the length of pulses that they last for.
