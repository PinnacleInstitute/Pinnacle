<P align=left><FONT color=#333333 size=2>When we say we can read music this is what we are talking about. It means we understand the language of music and can communicate by understanding and using it. <B>Notation is the act of writing down music.</B> We might say <I>"Can you notate this?"</I> or <I>"What does this notation tell us?"</I> <B>The place in which we write music is a score.</B> This could be a single line of music or a multi paged epic. We might say <I>"This is the score for that sonata you wanted."</I> or <I>"We can see an example on the third page of the score."</I></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>But <B>there is not just one form of notation</B> as there is not one form of language but if we talk about Western music in the traditional or "Classical" format, this is what we&nbsp;mean by notation. This doesn't of course mean that we have to be placed within the Western world or to only play Classical music but rather as a distinction between other written or non written forms of music. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>Is this form of notation the same for all styles of music? Well yes in terms of Medieval, Classical, Romantic and&nbsp;much 20th Century&nbsp;music. Yes for much pop, rock, R &amp; B, R &amp; R, easy listening, jazz, blues, opera, jigs, reels, hymns, ballet...&nbsp;the list is endless. However <B>some 20th Century&nbsp;composers&nbsp;(see Schoenberg or&nbsp;Lutoslawski for example)&nbsp;experimented with the format of traditional notation</B> and came up with other forms of notation. <B>Many rock &amp; pop composers have used their own&nbsp;style of notation</B> - it is said that the Beatles could not read traditional notation and in genres such as jazz, there is often the space for <B>improvisation or "making it up" which moves away from any written or fixed notation</B> .</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>Is notation the same for all instruments? Well <B>all instruments can use some form of notation</B> but this changes depending upon the instrument itself. For example a&nbsp;non-tuned percussive instrument such as castanets, drums, cymbals and wood sticks would only read <B>rhythmic score</B> . Solo instruments such as flute, clarinet, violin, cello, trumpet or trombone will only read <B>one line of pitch score</B> whereas a piano, organ, keyboard or harpsichord for example will read <B>two or more lines of pitch score</B> . Guitars can read traditional score, tab or chord boxes and church bells can use pitch, letter patterns or number patterns.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2>So what can notation tell us? Well notation can tell us the <B>duration of&nbsp;each sound or rest</B> (rest = a lack of sound or space for silence), the<B> pitch</B> (pitch = high like a childs squeal or low like a roll of thunder), the <B>volume,</B> the&nbsp;overall <B>speed</B> , <B>when exactly a particular sound should start&nbsp;and stop</B> and&nbsp;any other&nbsp;<B> direction from the composer</B> . <B>Not all notation will contain&nbsp;each of these elements but it will contain at least one element</B> . If a piece of music is complex, for example a symphony for full orchestra, the composer or at least the conductor, will want to give precise direction. A mainly improvised reel based around folk songs might only need notation of how many bars are in what key which leads us onto our next lesson...</FONT>
