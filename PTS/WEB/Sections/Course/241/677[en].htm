<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Selecting Columns and Rows</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>Selecting a column selects the entire column, from row 1 to row 65,536, while selecting a row selects the entire row, from column A to column IV. You can select columns and rows when you want to perform functions such as formatting, changing the width of more than one column at a time or the height of more than one row at a time, hiding columns or rows, and inserting and deleting columns or rows. When a column or row is selected, every cell in the column or row is highlighted, except for the first cell. This cell is the active cell.

</OL><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Changing the Width of Columns</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>When you create a new worksheet, the default width of the columns is set to fit approximately eight numbers in the default font. You may need to adjust the column width to accommodate changes in the font size, increases or decreases in cell values, or to save worksheet space. If you change the font or number format in a worksheet, the text or numbers may become too wide to fit in the column. Text can spill over into the next cell to the right, as long as that cell is empty. If a cell contains a numeric entry that is larger than the column width, however, pound signs (#) appear in it. In other words, numeric entries do not spill over. If there is an entry in the adjacent cell of a long text entry, the long text entry becomes truncated, requiring you to increase the column width. You may, however, also want to decrease the width of some of the other columns to save space on the worksheet. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When you increase or decrease column width, the column size and number of pixels appears in a ScreenTip to the right of the column you are resizing.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>The height of rows in a worksheet automatically adjusts to fit the largest font in that row. The standard row height is 12.75 points. You can, however, manually increase or decrease row height as needed. When you increase or decrease row height, the height and number of pixels appears in a ScreenTip to the right of the row you are resizing. You can increase row height to emphasize headings or totals. You also can decrease the height of a blank row to use it as a narrow separator row.

<P><FONT size=3>You can insert columns into an existing worksheet to add new information or to create logical divisions within worksheet data. Since columns are inserted from row 1 to row 65,536, you should verify that inserting a new column will not adversely affect any data above or below the current data. For example, you may have data in A1:G10 and A50:G60. If you insert a column between columns E and F, a blank column is inserted not only between the data in A1:G10, but also between the data in A50:G60. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When you insert a column, any formulas with ranges that include cells on both sides of the new column expand automatically to include the new column.
