<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Copying/Cutting and Pasting Data</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>When you are creating a worksheet, you can save time by copying cell contents from one location to another. The <B>Copy</B> feature copies the selected cell contents to the Office Clipboard. The <B>Paste</B> feature pastes the contents from the Office Clipboard into the currently selected range on the worksheet. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When you copy cells that contain text or numbers, Excel creates an exact copy of the contents when they are pasted to another location. When you copy cells containing formulas, Excel adjusts the cell references for the new row or column where the formula is pasted. For example, if the formula <B>=B1+B2+B3 </B>calculates the total of three cells in column B, and you copy that formula to the adjacent cell in column C, the adjacent cell will contain the formula <B>=C1+C2+C3</B> to calculate the total of the three corresponding cells in column C. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Excel assumes that the paste range will match the copied range exactly. For example, if the copied range consists of three cells, Excel assumes that the paste range consists of three cells. Therefore, you only need to select the cell in the upper left corner of the paste range for the entire copied range to be pasted. If the copied area is a single cell and you select a paste range with multiple cells, the contents of the copied cell are placed in each cell in the paste range. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can also move cell contents on a worksheet using the <B>Cut</B> and <B>Paste</B> features. The <B>Cut</B> feature cuts the cell contents from the worksheet and places them on the Office Clipboard. The <B>Paste</B> feature pastes the contents from the Office Clipboard into the currently selected range on the worksheet. The cell contents from the range that was cut are deleted from the worksheet. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When you move cells containing formulas, Excel does not adjust the cell references in the formulas. The formulas still refer to the original cells for the calculation. If you move the formula and the cells containing the data, the cell references in the formula adjust to the new location of the data. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The <B>Clipboard</B> toolbar, which displays the items on the Office Clipboard, automatically appears as soon as two items are cut or copied in a row. An icon appears on the toolbar for each cut or copied item. The Office Clipboard can hold more than one item; therefore, the <B>Paste</B> feature does not remove the item from the Clipboard. You can continue to paste the same item again and again.</FONT>

</OL><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Creating an Absolute Reference</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>There are two basic types of cell references in Excel: relative and absolute. The difference between absolute and relative cell references becomes apparent when you copy formulas from one cell to another. When you copy a formula containing relative references, the references are adjusted to reflect the new location. Absolute references always refer to the same cell, regardless of where the formula is copied. Relative references are the default. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>For example, you create a formula at the bottom of column A to calculate the total of the numbers in that column. You then copy that formula to columns B and C. The cell references adjust as necessary to add the values in the appropriate columns. These are relative cell references. Absolute cell references are useful when you do not want a cell reference to change when a formula is copied to another location. For example, you need to create a formula to calculate the commission for a group of salespeople. The commission rate of 10% is entered into cell C1. You want the formula that calculates the commission to always refer to cell C1, even when it is copied to other cells. Making the reference to cell C1 absolute allows you to copy the formula and have the commission calculation always based on cell C1. If the commission rate changes to 12%, you only have to change cell C1 from 10% to 12%. The commissions for all the salespeople will automatically update. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>An absolute reference is designated by a dollar sign ($) before the column letter and row number. You can type the dollar signs ($) when you create the formula, or you can press the <B>[F4]</B> key after you type the cell reference and have Excel add the dollar signs ($) to make it absolute. Pressing the <B>[F4] </B>key repeatedly toggles you through each of the four types of referencing:</FONT>
