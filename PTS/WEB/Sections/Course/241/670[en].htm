<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Working with Ranges</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>Many Excel commands are executed after selecting several cells. The command then affects all the selected cells. A group of selected cells is called a range. A range can contain adjacent or non-adjacent cells. A non-adjacent range consists of two or more separate blocks of cells that can be adjoining, separate, or overlapping. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Ranges are identified by the addresses of the cells in the upper left and lower right corners of the selected block of cells, separated by a colon. For example, the range A4:C10 has cell A4 in the upper left corner and cell C10 in the lower right corner. To identify non-adjacent ranges, you separate the range addresses with a comma. For example, A4:A10,C4:C10 refers to the range A4:A10 as well as the range C4:C10. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Selecting a range before executing a command is especially useful if you are using a toolbar or keyboard shortcut to perform an action. If a dialog box opens when you execute a menu command, however, you can specify the desired range in the dialog box. In this case, you do not have to select a range before you execute the desired command. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>A selected range has a heavy black border surrounding it. All the cells contained in the range appear shaded except for the active cell.</FONT><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Selecting Ranges with the Keyboard</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>You can select ranges with the keyboard. Keyboard techniques are useful when you are working with small ranges. A range can be deselected by pressing any arrow key or clicking any cell in the worksheet.

<P><FONT size=3>You can use the mouse to select a range.

<P><FONT size=3>You add non-adjacent cells to a selected range using the mouse in conjunction with the <B>[Ctrl]</B> key. This method is useful when you want to execute a command that affects ranges in different sections of a worksheet. You may want to apply the same format to the titles in row 1 and summary totals in row 10. By selecting the two non-adjacent ranges, you can apply the same format to both of the rows at once.

<P><FONT size=3>You can quickly enter data into a selected range using a shortcut method. As you type each entry into the range and press the <B>[Enter]</B> key, the active cell automatically moves vertically to the next cell in the range, even if the range spans several columns. When the active cell reaches the last selected cell in the current column, it automatically moves to the first selected cell in the next column. In a non-adjacent range, when the active cell reaches the last cell at the bottom right corner of the first block of cells, it advances to the first cell at the top left corner of the next, non-adjacent, block of cells.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>You can use the <B>AutoFill</B> feature in Excel to create a standard series of labels on a worksheet. Examples of standard series include months of the year, days of the week, and quarter labels. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When you select a range, a small, black box called the fill handle displays in the lower right corner of the range. When the mouse pointer is positioned on the fill handle, it changes into a solid, black plus (+) sign. When you drag the fill handle to select a range you want to fill, Excel fills the range based on the contents of the first cell in the range. If the cell contains a label that Excel recognizes as the first item in a standard series, the range is filled with the rest of the items in the label series.
