<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Selecting a Cell using the Keyboard</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>When you open Excel, a blank workbook appears in the application window. You will notice a thick black border around the first cell in the upper left corner of the worksheet. This cell is known as the active cell. When data is entered, it appears in the active cell.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can use the keyboard to select a cell and make it the active cell. When you press certain arrow keys or a combination of keys, the cell pointer moves to a new cell, making it the active cell. The following table lists ways in which you can use the keyboard to move to a cell:</FONT>

Text automatically aligns to the left in a cell. If the text is too long to fit within a cell, it appears as if it has spilled over into the next cell.

They are not actually deleted and will appear if you widen the column that contains the long text entry.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Text is always entered into the active cell. Therefore, you should be sure that the active cell is the appropriate cell before you start typing. If you press the <B>[Enter]</B> key after you finish typing an entry, the active cell automatically moves down one cell. When you are typing text into a cell, you are in enter mode.

For example, an address such as <B>17 Maple Avenue</B> is considered a text entry even though it begins with a number. You can type a minus sign before a number or enclose a number in parentheses to indicate a negative value. You can also type a period to indicate a decimal point and enter decimals. If you enter a decimal that ends in zero (0) such as 345.50, however, the ending zero will be dropped, and the number will display as 345.5. A cell must be formatted for decimal places to display a number with a decimal ending in zero. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Numbers can exist as independent values, or they can be used in formulas to calculate other values.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can type dates into a worksheet. Excel treats dates as numbers so that it can perform calculations, such as determining how many days a bill is past due.

<P><FONT size=3>The <B>AutoComplete</B> feature helps speed up entry into a column containing text by completing the entry after you have typed a few characters. It is common to have to repeat entries when you are entering text into a column. For a column titled <B>Region</B> , possible entries might include <B>New</B> <B>York</B> , <B>Boston</B> , <B>Chicago</B> , etc. These entries are likely to be repeated more than once. As you type entries into a column, Excel automatically compiles a list of the entries. When you type the first few letters of a repeated entry in that column, Excel finishes typing the entry for you. If you do not want to use the entry that Excel suggests, you simply continue typing. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The <B>Pick From List</B> feature is a quick way to enter text into a column because it allows you to select an entry from a list.
