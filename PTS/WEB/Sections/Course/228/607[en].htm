<H2 align=center><A name=1>What is depression? </A></H2>
<P><FONT size=2>Depression is an illness that affects the body, mood, and thoughts. About twice as many women suffer from depression as men. People who are depressed may feel hopeless, worthless, very sad, and have no energy or interest in doing anything. Some people describe depression as an "empty, or sad feeling that won't go away." This kind of depression that does not go away is called "clinical depression." It is different from feeling "blue" or down for a few hours or a couple of days.</FONT> <H3><A name=2>What causes depression? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=2>Many things cause depression. Depression can run in families. Changes in your brain chemistry and living through painful and difficult events in your life can cause depression. Sometimes depression is caused by certain medications people take for cancer, <B>arthritis</B>, heart problems, and <B>high blood pressure</B>. Some illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, and hormonal problems can cause depression.</FONT> <H3><A name=3>What are the signs of depression? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=2>Here is a list of the most common signs of depression. If you have some of these signs that last for more than two weeks, see your health care provider. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=2>Most people with depression get better when they get treatment. The two most common treatments for depression are medication and psychotherapy (talking with a trained counselor). Support groups can help. Sometimes just one treatment is used and sometimes a person takes medicine and sees a psychotherapist. Health care providers may need to try different medicines to find the one(s) that help you the most. It also may take a few weeks or months on the medicine before you begin to feel a change in your mood and outlook. </FONT><H3><A name=5>How can I get help for my depression? </A></H3>

While life with a new baby can be thrilling and rewarding, it can also be hard and stressful at times. Many physical and emotional changes can happen to a woman when she is pregnant and after she gives birth. These changes can leave new mothers feeling sad, anxious, afraid, or confused. For many women, these feelings (called the baby blues ) go away quickly. But when these feelings do not go away or get worse, a woman may have postpartum depression. This is a serious condition that requires quick treatment from a health care provider.</FONT></H2></FONT><H3><A name=2>What is postpartum depression? </A>Are the "baby blues" the same thing as postpartum depression? </H3>
<P><FONT size=2><B>Postpartum depression (PPD)</B> is a condition that describes a range of physical and emotional changes that many mothers can have after having a baby. PPD can be treated with medication and counseling. Talk with your health care provider right away if you think you have PPD. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>There are three types of PPD women can have after giving birth: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>The <I>baby blues</I> happen in many women in the days right after childbirth. A new mother can have sudden mood swings, such as feeling very happy and then feeling very sad. She may cry for no reason and can feel impatient, irritable, restless, anxious, lonely, and sad. The baby blues may last only a few hours or as long as 1 to 2 weeks after delivery. The baby blues do not always require treatment from a health care provider. Often, joining a support group of new moms or talking with other moms helps. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><FONT size=2><I>Postpartum depression</I> (PPD) can happen a few days or even months after childbirth. PPD can happen after the birth of any child, not just the first child. A woman can have feelings similar to the baby blues - sadness, despair, anxiety, irritability - but she feels them much more strongly than she would with the baby blues. PPD often keeps a woman from doing the things she needs to do every day</FONT>. </FONT><FONT size=2>When a woman's ability to function is affected, this is a sure sign that she needs to see her health care provider right away. If a woman does not get treatment for PPD, symptoms can get worse and last for as long as 1 year. While PPD is a serious condition, it can be treated with medication and counseling. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2><I>Postpartum psychosis</I> is a very serious mental illness that can affect new mothers. This illness can happen quickly, often within the first 3 months after childbirth. Women can lose touch with reality, often having auditory hallucinations (hearing things that aren't actually happening, like a person talking) and delusions (seeing things differently from what they are). Visual hallucinations (seeing things that aren't there) are less common. Other symptoms include <B>insomnia</B> (not being able to sleep), feeling agitated (unsettled) and angry, and strange feelings and behaviors. Women who have postpartum psychosis need treatment right away and almost always need medication. Sometimes women are put into the hospital because they are at risk for hurting themselves or someone else. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT size=2>A woman may feel anxious after childbirth but not have PPD. She may have what is called <I>postpartum anxiety</I> or <I>panic disorder</I> . Signs of this condition include strong</FONT></FONT><FONT size=2>anxiety and fear, rapid breathing, fast heart rate, hot or cold flashes, chest pain, and feeling shaky or dizzy. Talk with your health care provider right away if you have any of these signs. Medication and counseling can be used to treat postpartum anxiety. </FONT><H3><A name=4>Who is at risk for getting postpartum depression? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=2>Postpartum depression (PPD) affects women of all ages, economic status, and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Any woman who is pregnant, had a baby within the past few months, miscarried, or recently weaned a child from breastfeeding can develop PPD. The number of children a woman has does not change her chances of getting PPD. New mothers and women with more than one child have equal chances of getting PPD. Research has shown that women who have had problems with depression are more at risk for PPD than women who have not had a history of depression. </FONT><H3><A name=5>What causes postpartum depression? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT size=2>No one knows for sure what causes postpartum depression (PPD). Hormonal changes in a woman's body may trigger its symptoms. During pregnancy, the amount of two female hormones, estrogen and progesterone, in a woman's body increase greatly. In the first 24 hours after childbirth, the amount of these hormones rapidly drops and keeps dropping to the amount they were before the woman became pregnant. Researchers think these changes in hormones may lead to depression, just as smaller</FONT></FONT><FONT size=2>changes in hormones can affect a woman's moods before she gets her menstrual period. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>Thyroid levels may also drop sharply after giving birth. (The <B>thyroid</B> is a small gland in the neck that helps to regulate how your body uses and stores energy from foods eaten.) Low thyroid levels can cause symptoms that can feel like depression, such as mood swings, fatigue, agitation, insomnia, and anxiety. A simple thyroid test can tell if this condition is causing a woman's PPD. If so, thyroid medication can be prescribed by a health care provider. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>Other things can contribute to PPD, such as: </FONT>

<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Feeling tired after delivery, broken sleep patterns, and not enough rest often keeps a new mother from regaining her full strength for weeks. This is particularly so if she has had a <I>cesarean (C-section) delivery</I> . </FONT>

<P align=left><FONT size=2>Feeling overwhelmed with a new, or another, baby to take care of and doubting your ability to be a good mother. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Feeling stress from changes in work and home routines. Sometimes women think they have to be "super mom" or perfect, which is not realistic and can add stress. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Having feelings of loss - loss of identity (who you are, or were, before having the baby), loss of control, loss of a slim figure, and feeling less attractive. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Having less free time and less control over time. Having to stay home indoors for longer periods of time and having less time to spend with the baby's father.</FONT>
</UL><H3><A name=6>How is postpartum depression treated? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=2>It is important to know that postpartum depression (PPD) is treatable and that it will go away. The type of treatment will depend on how severe the PPD is. PPD can be treated with medication (<B>antidepressants</B>) and psychotherapy. Women with PPD are often advised to attend a support group to talk with other women who are going through the same thing. If a woman is breastfeeding, she needs to talk with her health care provider about taking antidepressants. Some of these drugs affect breast milk and should not be used.</FONT> <H3><A name=7>What can I do to take better care of myself if I get postpartum depression?</A></H3>
