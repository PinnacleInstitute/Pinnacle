<P>While financial goals will depend upon what you and others in your household believe are important, there are certain general areas around which to organize specific financial objectives. 
<P>One general goal is <B>protection against risk</B>. Risks to consider include income loss and expense of premature death and disability, medical care expenses, property and liability losses, and unemployment. 
<P><B>Asset accumulation</B> is another general goal. Consider the importance of an emergency fund in this category. An emergency fund can be an important buffer when those unexpected expenses occur. Any future expenses might also be included under this category of financial goals. For example, will there be education expenses for household members? Is the purchase of a home or starting a business in the works? Or, perhaps you are building assets for general investment purposes to receive a greater financial goal. Again, decide on your own particular reasons for building assets. 
<P><B>Providing for retirement income</B> will be another goal. Because of the uncertainties associated with retirement, planning needs to begin at an early age. And, financial planning cannot stop at retirement. Longer lives and even moderate inflation cause the need to provide for increasing income in a retirement plan. 
<P><B>Tax reduction</B> is another area for planning. The goal for tax planning should be to pay what is legally owed, but not a penny more. In addition, estate planning or determining how to best distribute assets at death with minimal losses to the estate can be part of a financial plan.
