<P>How can a financial plan be developed which will meet specific needs? 
<P><B>First</B>, gather all pertinent information relating to finances. Gather information about income, expenditures, insurance coverages, employee benefits, investments, wills -- any document or information that relates to your individual situation. Complete a net worth statement and an income/expense statement at this time to better understand the current financial position. 
<P><B>Second</B>, identify financial goals and objectives. Clearly define what it is you are striving toward. Look to the financial planning goal categories above and determine what your specific financial goals and objectives are. Communication with others in the household is an important part of this planning phase. While reaching a consensus is sometimes difficult, identifying goals, objectives and priorities is crucial. 
<P><B>Then</B>, analyze your present situation. What is your current financial position? Are goals and objectives consistent with situation? Are there areas of deficiency that will need to be resolved? 
<P>Nonfinancial factors such as age and health of household members; number of dependents and their anticipated length of financial dependency; amount and stability of income, both present and future; and the financial temperament of household members, especially of adults, need to be considered. 
<P><B>Next</B>, consider alternatives. During this phase, seek information to determine what consequences there are for the various alternatives you have. Getting information from financial advisers will be an important part of this step. 
<P><B>Develop</B> the plan which includes specific strategies for meeting goals and objectives such as budgeting, automatic payroll deductions for savings or retirement, or developing an investment strategy. Look at the plan and ask if it allows you to meet your specific financial objectives. More importantly, is it a plan you can live with? Then put the plan into action. 
<P><B>Finally</B>, review and revise. No plan should ever be considered final. As circumstances change, adjust the plan. Remember that the basic purpose of a financial plan is to help you reach the financial goals you have set.
