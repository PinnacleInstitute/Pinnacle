<DD><FONT size=3>Go beyond examples provided in class and in the text, and bring your general knowledge and experiences into play by relating them to academic ideas. In kinesiology, for example, relate your ability to throw a ball to the physical forces you study in class; in biology, relate photosynthesis to that poor potted plant that struggles in your basement; in sociology relate symbolic interaction to values that you learned from your parents; in geography relate the Canadian Shield to your trip to Algonquin Park; in chemistry relate acids to home uses of vinegar; in physics relate acceleration to riding your bike. When you can generate your own examples, you demonstrate your understanding, and your memory is enhanced.
