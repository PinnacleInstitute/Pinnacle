<P>First of all you need a voice that is fit to be trained. Before learning to sing, you have to develop the range of notes by dint of good stance, good posture. Then comes the business of singing, developing the breathing. Singing teachers have a variety of methods to help their students identify the muscle groups used to breathe properly. One method I frequently use involves a straight-backed chair. If you sit well back, you can practise breathing down into the back, feeling the lateral rib expansion and the back rib expansion against the back of the chair. When practising breathing exercises I tell students, ‘When you have a full breath, go on breathing in. Then when you think you are full, go on further, stretch the muscles a bit more now.

<P>The secret is to make the registers sound smooth all the way up and down. ‘An audible break shouldn’t be there. Aim to have a perfectly even range of two octaves plus. I tend to avoid the term ‘voice’ in relation to ‘head’ or ‘chest’. The voice comes from the larynx, and these terms can be confusing to the student. I prefer ‘top register’, ‘middle register’ and ‘bottom register’. ‘<I> Head</I>  and <I> chest</I>  I do find useful when talking about the resonance of the voice. One can talk in terms of sensation in the chest, in the face, in the head, in the back or the back of the neck even… it’s how it <I> feels</I> ."
