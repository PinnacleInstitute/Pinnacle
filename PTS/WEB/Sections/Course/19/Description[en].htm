	Our characteristic styles or patterns of relating to others determine the ease with which we build relationships. Most of our behavior patterns are established early in life through the influence of peers, education, parents, authority figures, and environment. Through our lives, a variety of behavior patterns are reinforced and become habits.</p>

	<font face="Times-Roman">While our habits make us fairly predictable, everyone has different habits. That&rsquo;s what keeps relationships interesting and challenging!</font><i><font face="Times-Italic"> </font></i></p>

	<i><font face="Times-Italic">The Platinum Rule&trade; </font></i><font face="Times-Roman">assembles a number of simple tools that can be easily applied to improve both business and interpersonal relationships.

	<i><font face="Times-Italic">The Platinum Rule&trade; </font></i><font face="Times-Roman">will show you how to &quot;Do unto others the way they </font><b><font face="Times-Bold">want </font></b><font face="Times-Roman">and </font><b><font face="Times-Bold">need </font></b><font face="Times-Roman">you to do unto them&quot; by teaching you to: </font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Times-Roman">&bull; UNDERSTAND THAT although each individual&rsquo;s personality is as unique as his or her thumbprint, many behaviors can be positioned within a systematic, predictable framework. </font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Times-Roman">&bull; IDENTIFY how a person&rsquo;s behavioral patterns influence what that person wants, needs and expects from you and others; and how that person communicates those wants, needs and expectations. People will actually tell you how to deal with them if you know what to listen and look for. </font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Times-Roman">&bull; ADAPT to people in a way that will reduce tension and increase cooperation and trust in all varieties of relationships. </font></p>
<p align="left">
	<font face="Times-Roman">It is my belief that people will show you, actually teach you, how they prefer to be treated if you will listen to what they have to say, watch what they do, and be willing to accommodate possible differences between their styles and your own. It&rsquo;s not hard! And the rewards&mdash;in terms of productive, trusting relationships&mdash;can be substantial in many areas of your life.</font></p>
