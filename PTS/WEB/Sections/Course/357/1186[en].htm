<P>Story Four 
<P>George was brilliant but felt that he would never make a doctor.&nbsp; He loved studying medicine 
<P>but he couldn't <B>envision</B> practicising it.&nbsp; He eventually quit medical school and was tutoring 
<P>aspiring doctors.&nbsp; Let's sit in on one of his tutoring sessions. 
<P>"Okay, Marcia.&nbsp; The next word is <B>idiosyncrasy</B> .&nbsp; Can you define it? 
<P>"Easy.&nbsp; It refers to an abnormal <B>susceptibility</B> to a drug, protein or other agent 
<P>&nbsp;which is peculiar to the individiual." 
<P>"Define <B>limpid</B> and <B>lipid</B> ." 
<P>"<B> Limpid</B> is clear and transparent, such as a pool of water, while <B>lipid</B> is a fat-like substance that is insoluble in water." 
<P>"Excellent," George said&nbsp;becoming lost when&nbsp;he looked into her <B>limpid</B> eyes. 
<P>It gave him a feeling of&nbsp;<B> angst</B> , an uncertain anxiety, the source of which he could not fathom. 
<P>"I wonder if you are a <B>misogynist</B> ," Marcia said cheekily. 
<P>"Not in the least.&nbsp; I'm a <B>misogamist</B> ." 
<P>"What's the difference?" 
<P>"I like women.&nbsp; In fact I adore them, so I couldn't be considered a <B> misogynist</B> .&nbsp; I'm just despise the whole 
<P>idea of getting married." 
<P>"I see," said Marcia.&nbsp; "You'll get over it." 
<P>"No, I won't," George said.&nbsp; "You see I'm too much of a <B>narcissist</B> to survive marrriage." 
<P>"Whatever," Marcia said.&nbsp; "Thanks for your help." 
<P>"When will I see you again?" 
<P>"Tomorrow.&nbsp; Aren't we doing <B>substrate</B> , <B>detritus</B> , <B>ablation</B> and that sort of thing then?" 
<P>"Right," George said.&nbsp; "See you tomorrow." 
<P>Why does she make me feel such a fool? he asked himself.
