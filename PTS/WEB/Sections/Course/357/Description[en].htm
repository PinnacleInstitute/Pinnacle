<P><B>Course Requirements</B> 
<P>Vocabulary Edge has been designed to address the needs of students in grades ten through twelve.&nbsp; The best time to start preparing for the SAT is when you are in grade ten, although some students start much earlier.&nbsp; 
<P><B>Course Goals</B> 
<P>The course goals are to equip students not only with an enhanced vocabulary but also&nbsp;an appreciation for such concepts as word derivation, prefix assimilation, eponyms and word attack skills.&nbsp; It is reasonable to expect to learn 300 new words.&nbsp; If you are diligent you may end up learning 500 new words. 
<P><B>Course Materials</B> 
<P><B>The student should have access to a dictionary that provides derivations and pronunciation.</B> 
<P>Each lesson contains a story that introduces&nbsp;up to&nbsp;15 words which are subsequently reinforced and tested.&nbsp; You need to know every&nbsp; <B>bolded word</B> &nbsp;in all <B> eight stories</B>  in Vocabulary Edge.&nbsp; Consider the linked material in the SAT Mastery course&nbsp;as reinforcement of words that are found in Vocabulary Edge and as an introduction to words that&nbsp;you may eventually encounter on an SAT test.&nbsp;
<P>Each lesson has a quiz that contains words from the current lesson&nbsp;as well as from&nbsp;previous lessons. In addition it contains one or two new words just to keep you on your toes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secret of learning a word for keeps is to use it five times.
