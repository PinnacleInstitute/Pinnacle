Story 2.&nbsp;
<P>John knew if he acted&nbsp;<B> nonchalantly</B> , the cops would not likely pay&nbsp;him any heed so that's what he did.&nbsp; All the other kids scattered, yet John was the one who had <B> incriminating</B>  material on his person.&nbsp; There's no problem, he thought.&nbsp; Besides, I'm <B> dapper</B>  and <B> debonair</B> .&nbsp; I'd be the last person the&nbsp;fuzz would be likely to&nbsp;<B> accost</B> .
<P>"Stop! Police!"
<P>"Yes sir," said John turning around slowly.
<P>"Did you see&nbsp;three or four&nbsp;<B> hooligans</B>  go down this street?"
<P>"Yeah, they were kind of rough looking, weren't they?"&nbsp; he asked thinking, How could he turn in his friends?
<BR>How could he indeed.&nbsp; He had to stall for time.
<P>"I think they turned left at the next light," he said.
<P>"Much <B> obliged</B> ," the officer said.&nbsp; "You've been a great help.&nbsp; Those guys are going to get the book thrown at them when we catch them."
<P>John nodded.&nbsp; He knew that if he spoke, it would come out as a squeak.&nbsp; He could already feel his knees beginning to shake.&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;That's if, John decided as he shuffled home.&nbsp; I'm out of the gang.&nbsp; That was a <B> mite</B>  too close for comfort.
