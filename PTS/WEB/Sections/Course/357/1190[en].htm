<P>"Do you mean to tell me that moral value can be defined in terms 
<P>of pleasure?" Janice asked incredulously.
<P>"Of course," Harvey said.&nbsp; "It's one of the defining features of my life."
<P>"You're nothing more than a crass hedonist," Janice said allowing her 
<P>rancor to show.
<P>"And to top it off," said Harvey, "The pursuit of pleasure is the highest good."
<P>"Hedonism is such a waste of time," Janice said shaking her head sadly.
<P>"And why do you say that?"
<P>"Look at all that needs doing."
<P>"Such as?"
<P>"Looking after the needy, fighting injustice and I don't know what all else."
<P>"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
<P>"That may be true, but to think that you Harvey Wallbanger, are a hedonist 
<P>is more than I can stomach right now."
<P>"To each his own."
