<P>Story Five
<P>As they were sailing,&nbsp;across the bay, John sailed too close to the wind and the sails begin to luff.&nbsp; Before they could flap too strenuously,&nbsp;John turned the tiller and the boat began to pick up speed again.
<P>"The wind is beginning to veer to the south," George said.&nbsp; 
<P>"Of course it is," John said.&nbsp; "It was blowing from the east and now it's blowing from the south."
<P>"That's funny," George said.&nbsp; "When I was in the Sydney to Hobart race last summer, the wind did just that very same thing but the sailors claimed that it didn't veer."
<P>"Of course not," John said.&nbsp; "In the Southern Hemisphere the wind only veers when it changes direction in a counter-clockwise direction."
<P>"Great now, we're becalmed," George complained.
<P>"Good show," said John.&nbsp; "Let's do some vocabulary until the wind picks up again."
<P>"Okay," George agreed.&nbsp;
