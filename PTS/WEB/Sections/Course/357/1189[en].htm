<P>"That was quite a session," said Janice.&nbsp; 
<P>"It wasn't that bad," Harriet said.&nbsp; "You just have to memorize a few Greek roots and you can
<P>figure out what a whole <B> slew</B>  of words mean."
<P>"You mean like <B> helio</B>  for sun?" asked Janice.
<P>"Yeah, like <B> helianthus</B> ,<B>  heliocentric</B> ,<B>  heliotropic</B>  and <B> heliotropism</B> ."
<P>"Actually that's not that difficult," Janice retorted.&nbsp; "The <B> helianthus annus</B>  is the common sunflower."
<P>"A native North American plant," added Harriet.
<P>"Yes and grown for oil in Russia for about a century," Janice said. 
<P>"How about <B> heliocentric</B> ?" asked Harriet.&nbsp; "Wasn't that about the shift from the concept that 
<P>the Earth was the center of the universe?"
<P>"Explain the difference between <B> heliotrope</B>  and <B> heliotropism</B> ," said Janice ignoring Harriet's question.
<P>"That's not that difficult.&nbsp; <B> Heliotrope</B>  is a plant with small fragrant purple flowers and the tropism business 
<P>refers to a tendency for the plant to turn towards the sun.&nbsp; Not bad for a <B> plebian</B> , if I might be permitted 
<P>to say so," Harriet said. 
<P>"Not bad for a <B> plebian</B> ,"&nbsp;Janice agreed.&nbsp; "I know one thing for sure," said Janice.
<P>"Those Greek roots are going to be on the next quiz.
