<P>Story Three
<P>The patient was now well&nbsp;out of danger but it had been close for a spell.&nbsp; If it hadn't been for the fast action of a police officer who had the good sense to realize that perhaps the man was not <B>inebriated</B> but was instead&nbsp;in the <B>inchoate </B>stage of a&nbsp;diabetic coma the man could have&nbsp;died.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had been staggering along the sidewalk and&nbsp;was on the point of collapse when the police officer had taken charge. The officer slipped a straw into the man's mouth and within seconds&nbsp;the victim had&nbsp;returned to consciousness. 
<P>It's all part and parcel of the duties of a police officer, Constable Nonchalant thought as he went back to walking his beat.&nbsp; With a wife and five children at home, Nonchalant was more often <B>impecunious</B> than otherwise but he wasn't one to&nbsp;complain.&nbsp; He had an interesting job.&nbsp; No two afternoons were the same.&nbsp; There were invariably the odd <B>degenerate </B>to deal with and sometimes young punks bent on a variety of <B>depredations</B> ranging from robbery to pillage. 
<P>There goes Joe, the <B> maladroit</B>  pick-pocket&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonchalant&nbsp;couldn't count how many times, he'd warned the diligent dip to stay off his beat.&nbsp; &nbsp;For the next hour, everything was quiet in Queens.&nbsp; Lucy, a sometimes runaway teen&nbsp;was spotted meeting her boyfriend at the corner of Sylvester and Carbuncle Street for what&nbsp;was no doubt an <B>assignation</B> .&nbsp; The boy friend was a <B>salacious</B> looking character that Nonchalant had run in for a series of petty crimes, which resulted in the usual slap on the wrist.&nbsp; 
<P>There was nothing much doing for the next hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Foot traffic was light as most people were home having dinner and watching the Yankees getting shellacked by the Toronto Blue Jays.&nbsp; Nonchalant strolled along, stopping from time to time to talk to one of the regulars such as Mr. Bellini, the best darn green grocer this side of town at any rate. 
<P>"How are you tonight, Constable?" 
<P>"Can't complain," Nonchalant replied. 
<P>"Wouldn't do a whit of good," Mr. Bellini agreed.&nbsp; "By the way those rambunctious urchins have been up to their old tricks visiting <B>deprecations</B> upon the neighbourhood." 
<P>"Such as?" 
<P>"Graffito, I mean graffiti but in this case there was just one small piece." 
<P>"That's not nice," Nonchalant agreed.&nbsp; "Look at this," the constable said.&nbsp; "Someone has dropped his notebook." 
<P>"Was he stupid enough to put his name in it?" 
<P>"Old Harry Hooligan's kid.&nbsp; I'm going to&nbsp;have a little chat with his father.&nbsp; It's a lovely afternoon for George, the <B>nefarious</B> little rascal to do a bit of painting." 
<P>"I'll spray some shellac on it first," Mr. Bellini said.&nbsp;
