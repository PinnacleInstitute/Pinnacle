<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Story One</U> 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the days of the Old West, long before Zane Grey had made the West fashionable and created a new <B>genre</B> , there lived an outlaw who was so <B>degenerate</B> that even his very name carried <B>connotations</B> of moral <B>depredation</B> .&nbsp; Mal Volente was feared from the Pecos clear along the Sante Fe Trail until it reached what, in those days, passed for civilization. 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day, Mal, in one of his moody moments, was riding along the Sante Fe Trail, daydreaming about robbing stagecoaches, when he came across a damsel in distress.&nbsp; He reined his horse in&nbsp;and slid to the ground to help her.&nbsp; She had been a passenger in a stagecoach, which had overturned when the horses were spooked.&nbsp; Even though she was&nbsp;covered in dust, Mal could not fail to perceive that she was a young woman of considerable <B>pulchritude</B> . 
<P>The stagecoach had been demolished and the horses had run off into the desert.&nbsp; The driver and the guy who rode shotgun&nbsp;along with the remainder of the passengers had perished.&nbsp; Mal quickly made camp and set about cooking as fine a trail meal as had ever been served along the length of the Sante Fe. The <B>dastardly</B> outlaws had long since scooted. 
<P>The young woman, Miss Bella Hermosa, was quite taken with the attention she was receiving from Mal Volente.&nbsp; Such a nice young man, she thought. 
<P>"Tell me about yourself," she said. 
<P>"I'm just a simple cowboy," he said.&nbsp; "What do you want to know?" 
<P>"I'd like to know what you like to do for fun." 
<P>Mal thought for a moment, for he was rather taken by this young woman, whose <B>pulchritude</B> had not ever before been witnessed&nbsp;on the Santa Fe Trail.&nbsp; Better tell her the truth, he <B>admonished</B> himself. 
<P>"Nothing like coffee after a hard day's ride," he said.&nbsp; "Now where should I begin.&nbsp; I know, I'll start with my first stagecoach robbery when I was a mere lad of eighteen years." 
<P>"I remember it as if it were yesterday, " he began.&nbsp; "It was on a section of trail, not unlike this section, when my gang and I came across our <B>quarry</B> .&nbsp; We encountered a stagecoach that we knew was carrying gold from the Sierre Madre&nbsp;to Albuquerque.&nbsp; There was only one difference between our operation and the one that <B>befell </B>you today." 
<P>"What's that?" she asked with a smile for she didn't believe a word that he said. At the same time she somehow knew that she could trust him <B>implicitly</B> . 
<P>"No one got hurt." 
<P>"Tell me more." 
<P>"Only on one condition." 
<P>"What's that?" 
<P>"That you promise to marry me." 
<P>"I'll grant you that our relationship bears promise but please be aware that it is still in the <B>inchoate</B> stage.&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;We must not succumb to <B>quixotic</B> ideas." 
<P>Mal thought for a moment and stirred the fire for the night was becoming a mite chilly.&nbsp; He had no idea what she had been talking about.&nbsp; Oh curses, he thought.&nbsp; Going through life with a deficient vocabulary is worse than prison and that had been bad enough.&nbsp; What in tarnation does <B>inchoate</B> mean? 
<P>He waited until the woman, whose name he been too shy to ask, was asleep.&nbsp; He got his dictionary out. 
<P>It took him some time to get find <B>inchoate</B> because he had no idea&nbsp;how it was spelled.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P><B>Inchoate</B> - just beginning.&nbsp; That is encouraging, he told himself as he fell asleep, not too far from lady who 
<P>had more or less told him that she did not find him totally repugnant.
