<P>A pitfall that some busy parents fall into is to use money to buy love, or substitute money for companionship. The growth of a child's emotional stability and ability to manage money are hindered with this kind of situation. There is no substitute for parental love and companionship. So set aside some time in that busy schedule for each child and that child alone. 
<P>There is no set recipe or formula for teaching children to become responsible money managers. Parents can do a great deal to help their children develop healthy attitudes about money, its purpose and limits if they remember actions and examples speak louder than words. Parents can examine their own money attitudes and practices and use ideas discussed here to give children realistic money experiences. It will pay off in satisfactions for both parents and children.
