<H3 align=center><A name=put>Put Them "In the Know"</A></H3>
<P>A recent study indicated that there is much less fighting about money in families where financial matters are openly discussed. Help children develop a general understanding about the family's financial picture by allowing them to know the source of the family's income and a general "ballpark" amount figure. Most children don't want all the details of their family finances but they need to know the family, as a family, is secure. After all, family stability is probably the most important fact in their lives. 
<P>Answering your children's questions about the family's finances may be a lot like answering their questions about sex: answer the questions but don't repeat the whole book when a simple sentence or two will do the job. Ask yourself what is it they really want to know; then answer that question, but don't burden them with details they can't understand.
