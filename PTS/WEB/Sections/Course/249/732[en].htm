<P>If your five-year-old automatically squirrels every penny he gets, don't beam with pride. That's not considered normal behavior for small children. The child may need help and guidance in realizing that saving money is just a way of postponing the pleasure of spending. 
<P>Children will be more inclined to save if they are saving for a definite purpose. But make that purpose an immediate goal rather than long range. A 10-year-old will get more excited about saving for a new bicycle than saving for college. 
<P>Give children control over their own savings. Instead of a piggy bank that must be broken to get to the money inside, a bank that locks and can be easily opened <I>by your child</I> is a better idea. If saved money is easily accessible, children may learn even more about choice making. When children are old enough to sign their names so they can be read, go with them to a financial institution to open a passbook savings account.
