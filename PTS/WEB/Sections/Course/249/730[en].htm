<P>Give them full responsibility for their allowance. Let them make their own decisions--and their own mistakes. When we spend money as adults, we make choices and not all of our choices will be the right ones. Learning to live with the results of a poor choice in spending money is a valuable lesson, so let children make mistakes. A parents' advice should be available at all times and may be required for some things, but remember the final decision is still the child's and if they make a poor choice, avoid the temptation to say "I told you so." Cutting the purse strings can be as hard as cutting the apron strings.
