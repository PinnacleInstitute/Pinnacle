<P>Encourage them to earn it. As they get older, children's needs will soon outstrip a parent's ability to cover them with an allowance. Within the family, come up with a business deal for special jobs which someone would usually be hired to do such as window washing. But pay only for the exceptional job and not for routine household chores. Agree beforehand just what is to be done and how much will be paid. Pay children no more and no less than what the job's worth. 
<P>If possible, encourage them to find jobs outside the family when they are old enough. Such jobs give them a taste of working for someone else and meeting the expectations of people outside the family.
