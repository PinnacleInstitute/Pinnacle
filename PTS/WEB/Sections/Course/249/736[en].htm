<H3 align=center><A name=what>What If They Overspend?</A></H3>
<P>Try to find out why. Where did they blow their allowances? Do they know where it went? If not, this may be a good time to suggest keeping a simple record of their allowances. Advances on allowances are usually not a good idea. A much better idea is to find a way for children to earn the money they need.
