<P>When children are old enough to tell the difference between coins and when they begin to ask for money of their own, that's the time to begin a regular allowance. Probably most children will be able to handle an allowance by age 5 or 6 but perhaps even earlier if they have older brothers and sisters already receiving allowances. 
<P>Parents and children should decide together just what the allowance covers. The amount should cover their needs and include a little extra so that not every penny is spoken for before they get it. That little extra will be what they use to practice decision making. Do they spend it on this thing or that -  or do they save their allowance for something even bigger? If all of the allowance is spoken for, children have little opportunity to practice making choices. 
<P>The amount should be a fair share as it fits into the family's total spending pattern. Also consider what their friends receive as an allowance. An amount smaller or larger than what peers receive will cause problems for your child. Remember that the cost of living for children increases as they get older; renegotiate their allowance "contract" occasionally. 
<P>At first, pay the allowance once or twice a week depending on the child's age and ability to deal with the concepts of both time and money. Always pay children on the same day. A regular income they can depend on encourages the development of realistic attitudes about money and personal finance in general. 
<P>It may be a good idea to choose an allowance day that falls a few days before most spending is likely to occur, such as on Monday if the new comic books come out on Wednesday or Thursday when you take them with you shopping. Then they'll have the experience of being faced with a variety of buying choices before the major ones come. 
<P>Don't pay for everyday chores or for good grades. Doing this encourages the attitude that everyone and everything has a price tag and that children should get paid for everything they do. Some things we do as part of our responsibility for being a family member.
