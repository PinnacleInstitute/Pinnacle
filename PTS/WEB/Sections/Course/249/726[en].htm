<P>Actions speak louder than words in forming attitudes about money. So set a good example. Is money used in the family by parents as a bribe, reward or means of control? Are material goods craved? Is there an effort to keep up with the Joneses? Is more emphasis placed on the cost of a gift than the feeling of giving it? Since children are masters at spotting inconsistencies when parents say one thing and do another, be sure to practice what is preached. 
<P>Use every opportunity possible to teach smart buymanship. Help children learn to read labels, to ask clerks questions when they do not find information they need on labels, and to recognize a good buy. Take them with you when you shop. Explain why you choose to buy one item over another. Then offer guidance and suggestions when children are doing their own shopping, but remember, the final decisions are theirs when they are spending their money. 
<P>Set a good example in the use of credit. Credit involves responsibility as well as privileges, so be sure to pay debts promptly. Because credit is a necessary part of living in society, avoid making children afraid of it. If children have to borrow from their parents to meet unexpected expenses, set up a definite repayment schedule to give them some practical experience in using credit.
