<P>Never use money as a punishment or reward. Children will find it difficult to learn to manage money if they are never certain some of it will not be taken away as punishment. And children who know they can always get extra money for good behavior are just as handicapped. How can the learn to manage on a certain income if they always know they can count on more money if they play their cards right? 
<P>As the parent it will probably be difficult to give children their allowances when they deserve punishment; but find some other way--some way not involving money--to punish them if punishment is deserved. Many attitudes we have about money as adults result from how money was or was not used as a punishment or reward when we were children.
