<H3 align=center><A name=family>Family Financial Councils</A></H3>
<P>Let children sit in on family discussions and decisions about how to spend the family's income. By doing this, they'll develop a much better understanding of what the family's expenses are. Such discussion can help children also to see that their wants and needs are only part of what the family's income must cover. When they begin to see the total picture, they may be more willing to cooperate with family economy moves such as making clothes do for another year, taking care of furniture, and turning down the thermostats. 
<P>A family financial council gives everyone in the family a chance to express their ideas and wishes. Children can be asked for their opinions and can help in gathering information before the family makes a decision about a big-ticket item like a new car or television set. Older children can be involved even more by helping keep family records, check writing and discussions about the family's insurance program.
