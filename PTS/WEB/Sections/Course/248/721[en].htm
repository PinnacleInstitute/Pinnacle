<P>If you need financial planning and are willing to pay for advice, what will you receive for your expenditure? 
<P>A planner will help you clearly define your financial goals into objectives and help you rank them in importance. Then, based on the information you provide during interviews and on questionnaires, the planner will compare your current situation with your objectives and goals. Usually, this is done by analyzing net worth, income and expenses, investments, assets, insurance coverage, tax liability, retirement income potential and estate planning needs. 
<P>The planner's primary task is to combine your present resources and objectives into a workable plan for reaching your long-term goals. A good plan is fairly short, concrete and clear about what you must do. It is shaped by your needs and objectives, contains a written list of assumptions made when drawing up the plan, identifies potential trouble areas, and highlights several alternatives for reaching each goal. 
<P>A personalized plan may take a month or so to complete.
