<P>Start your hunt by asking friends and business associates for the names of planners they have worked with satisfactorily. Or, check with other financial advisers such as lawyers, accountants, or bankers. 
<P>You can also get names from referral services of the financial planning industry's major professional organizations:

<P>For fee-only planners, consult the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, Box 7833, Chicago, IL 69680. These associations offer no guarantee that the names they supply will be those of the most experienced or compatible planners. 
<P>Schedule an initial interview, at no cost, with at least three of the names you collect. Ask the same questions of each and let them know you are interviewing other people. 
<P>As you interview potential financial planners, use this set of questions and add your own. Use the area to the right of the questions to record any comments you might have as your interview progresses. Compare the responses from the potential financial planners as you make your decision.
