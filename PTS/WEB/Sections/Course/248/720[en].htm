<P>As you consider the benefits of a financial planner, also consider the cost. Financial planners are paid in one of three ways: fee-only, commission-only, or a combination of fee and commission. 
<P><B>Fee-only</B> planners charge a stated amount for a given level of plan, or they may charge by the hour for developing your financial plan. Financial planners who charge by <B>commission only</B> give free advice, and take commissions on the insurance and/or investments they sell you. The <B>fee-and-commission</B> approach combines both methods of payment such as fee for the financial plan, and if you choose to implement the plan with that person's products, a commission for the products sold. 
<P>In a fee-only practice, charges may be by the hour or a flat fee. A computer-generated plan with no personal consultation or continuing service may cost as much as $150 or more. A custom-developed plan for a family with income between $35,000 and $65,000 may cost from $750 to $2,000. 
<P>Although the cost may seem high, financial planners who use the fee-only system believe their objectivity and lack of personal interest in any particular firm's products justify the higher price. 
<P>If you choose a commission-only planner, the cost may be similar to fee-only, but the charge will be less visible. Ask the financial planner how much commission you will pay on each product proposed to you. 
<P>A planner who is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is required to give you information about commissions in writing. In the case of commission-only, you may find the title "financial planner" is a salesperson by another name. These people may be eager to direct your plan toward the products for which they receive the largest commission. 
<P>A combination of fee and commission is the most common method of charging for services. The commission allows the planner to lower the level of the fee, and the fee makes the "hard sell" somewhat less important. There is also the convenience of having the planner and the seller of the product within the same firm. 
<P>All three types of payment may also involve additional costs. An hourly fee or annual retainer is usually required for the planner to monitor and update the plan throughout the course of a year. Recommendations for trusts or wills will involve legal fees. Complex tax planning will result in accountant or tax consultant fees
