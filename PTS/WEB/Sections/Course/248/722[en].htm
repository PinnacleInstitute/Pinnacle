<P>There are no state or federal regulations which govern the use of the title, financial planner. Anyone can use that title. 
<P>Most legitimate financial planners have one or more college degrees from various fields and have completed correspondence courses at one of these nonaccredited financial planning institutions: 
<P><B>The College for Financial Planning</B>, located in Denver, Colorado, was founded in 1972. A curriculum considered the equivalent of 18 college credit hours includes courses in insurance, investments, taxes, employee benefits, retirement plans, and estate planning. Students must pass six exams to become Certified Financial Planners (CFP). <B>The American College</B> in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, is a school for insurance professionals. Students first taken seven courses required for the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation. Then, if they wish to specialize in financial planning, they add courses in employee benefits, real estate, taxes, and case study technique to earn designation as a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC). Experienced planners may take advanced courses in areas such as pensions and estate planning. 
<P><B>Academic degrees in financial planning</B>. A handful of universities such as Baylor, Brigham Young, Georgia State, and San Diego State award undergraduate degrees, and Golden Gate University's School of Financial Services in San Francisco offers a master's degree and an MBA in financial planning. 
<P>Experience counts a great deal in this area. Consider someone who has served an internship with an established financial planner. Training in accounting, law, insurance, and securities trading is also helpful, but be sure the person you choose has had at least some experience in total financial planning, not just work in a specialty area. 
<P>While financial planners are not regulated, other licenses hold them to certain standards. Having a broker's license in securities or real estate or being registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission are examples of such licenses and registrations.
