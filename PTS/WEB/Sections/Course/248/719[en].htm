<H3 align=center><A name=do>Do You Need a Financial Planner?</A></H3>
<P>Financial planners are generalists who take a broad view of a financial situation and try to design an overall strategy to meet specific financial objectives. More two-income households, increasingly complex tax laws, financial deregulation, and a greater variety of saving and investment options have increased the number and difficulty of financial decisions. Today both middle- and upper-income families may have a need for a financial planner. 
<P>You might consult a financial planner where there is a major change in your life such as a new job, a raise, marriage, parenthood, divorce, widowhood, or substantial inheritance or other windfall. If you are within 30 years of retiring, a financial planner can help you plan for adequate retirement income. 
<P>Or, if your financial affairs seem generally disorganized and without direction, a financial planner can help you measure where you are now, help you decide where you want to be, and design a plan with options to meet your goals. 
<P>Not everyone needs a financial planner. If your will needs updating or if you are looking for a tax shelter, you may need a specialist, such as an attorney or an accountant, rather than a generalist. 
<P>If you have no discretionary income, you may need help with budgeting and money management skills. Financial planners work primarily with families who have some discretionary income for investment. 
<P>Generally, single persons with annual gross income over $30,000 and married couples with income of $40,000 or more may find a financial planner useful. If you earn $100,000 or more, it is likely a financial planner could help you coordinate the advice you already receive from your stockbroker, accountant, and/or attorney.
