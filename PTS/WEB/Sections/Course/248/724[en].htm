<P>If the person in question has a securities license, contact the Securities and Exchange Commission or if the planner is an attorney, contact the state bar association. The two major associations of financial planning professionals, the International Association of Financial Planning, and the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, both respond to complaints from consumers and investigate disputes involving their members. Addresses for these organizations appear earlier in this publication.
