<P><B> What Are Frames?</B>
<P>Frames divide a web page into sections that each have a different HTML source page and their own set of scroll bars. They can be useful for any site that requires part of the screen to remain static while the remainder of the screen can be scrolled. One example is site navigation where links can be placed in one frame and the scrolling page content is placed in another. There are several disadvantages to using frames including slower download time and problems with linking and printing so be sure to use them only if necessary.
<P>As an example, the Web Boards used for many courses at FGCU use frames. The black navigation bar, Conferences list, and main content frame are the three independent frames, each having their own HTML source page.

<P>Frames pages actually consist of several HTML pages and the exact number depends on the number of frames on the page. The main page is called the <I>parent page</I>. This web page contains the instructions for the format and location of the frames, and a link to the initial loading page for each frame, but does not include the actual text or graphics that appear on the page. Each frame then has its own HTML source page that contains the text and graphics for that frame. Therefore, the WebBoard page displayed above actually consists of four pages: the parent and three frame source pages. You will need to keep this structure in mind when you save a frames page as FrontPage will prompt you to save each of these pages.

<P>Create a frames page by following these steps:

<LI>Preview each of the choices by clicking on an icon once with the mouse and seeing the <B>Preview</B> window. Select the icon of the frames format you would like to use and click <B>OK</B>. 
<LI>When viewed in <B>Page</B> view, the web page will be divided into frames and each frame will have "Set Initial Page..." and "New Page" buttons. Click <B>New Page</B> if the source page for the frame does not yet exist. The frame will immediately turn white after the button is clicked and you will be able to type and add graphics just like a normal web page. Click <B>Set Initial Page</B> if the source page for the frame has already been created and select the file from the dialog box.

<LI>Save the frames pages by selecting <B>Files|Save As</B> from the menu bar. You will be prompted to save the main frame page first followed by each of the frame source pages. The diagram will highlight the page you are saving. Below, the diagram highlights all of the frames in blue, indicating that the main frame page is being saved:

<P><B> No Frames Page</B>
<P>Early versions of browsers do not support, so it is necessary to prepare a page for visitors using these browsers. Build the "No Frames" page from the tab at the bottom of the screen. Use this page to link to individual main frame source pages in your site or provide links to download sites for the latest versions of Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.
