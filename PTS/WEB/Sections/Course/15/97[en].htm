<TD><P>Access the Components menu pictured to the right by selecting <B>Insert|Component</B> from the menu bar. To make the menu its own floating toolbar, click and drag the blue bar at the top of the menu. You must save the web page first to be able to use all of the components listed.
<P><B> Includes</B>
<P>The Include feature allows you to display one page within another. This can often be helpful when placing copyright notices or menu links that appear identically on many pages. The copyright notice, for example, can be typed into a separate file and then that one file can be linked to all the pages in the web site. When the copyright changes, only the include file needs to be changed instead of correcting the copyright text on every individual web page.
<P>To add an include page to another web page, first place the cursor on the page where the include file's contents should appear. Then, select <B>Insert|Component|Include Page</B> from the menu bar. Click the <B>Browse...</B> button to select the page you want to include and click <B>OK</B>. The include page's contents will appear on the destination page, but the contents can only be modified by opening the include page separately.

<P><B> Scheduled Picture</B>
<P>Setting scheduled elements will automatically change page content on a given date. Add a scheduled picture by selecting <B>Insert|Component|Scheduled Picture...</B> from the menu bar. Select the picture and choose an optional image to show before and after the scheduled time. Then, set the starting and ending time period. In this example, a picture of a pumpkin is added to the site for the entire month of October. Click <B>OK</B> when finished.

<P><B> Scheduled Include Page</B>
<P>A scheduled Include page can be added in a similar way that a scheduled picture is inserted. Select <B>Insert|Component|Scheduled Include Page...</B> from the menu bar, select the file, and set the time period.
<P><B> Date and Time</B>
<P>It is always advantageous to include a "last updated" date on the bottom of the web page so visitors know how recent the material is. FrontPage can automatically update this date whenever the page is saved. Place the cursor on the page where the date should appear and select <B>Insert|Date and Time...</B> from the menu bar. If the page is set up to automatically update and this date should be reflected as the "last update", check the "Date this page was last automatically updated" box. Select a <B>Date format</B> and if the time should also appear, select the <B>Time format</B>. Click <B>OK</B> when finished.

<P><B> Search Form</B>
<P>Add a search form to the web site by selecting <B>Insert|Component|Search Form</B> from the menu bar. This feature will automatically create a simple search form:
<P align=center><IMG height=75 alt="[Search form example]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/searchbox.gif" width=387>
<P>Customize the search form from the properties window.
