Shared Borders are parts of the web page that share content with the other pages in the web. They are located at the top, bottom, left side, or right side of the page and are useful for information that should appear on every page in the web such as navigation links, web site headers, and copyright information.
<P><B> Adding Shared Borders</B>
<P>Add shared borders to a web by following these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Open a web and select <B>Format|Shared Borders...</B> from the menu bar.
<BR><IMG height=321 alt="[Shared Borders dialog box]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/sharedborder.gif" width=407 vspace=10 border=1> 
<LI>Check <B>All pages</B> to apply the border(s) to every page in the web or <B>Current page</B> if the border(s) should appear only on the current page. 
<LI>Select the areas where the shared borders should appear by checking the Top, Left, Right, and Bottom boxes. It is not recommended to have content for the Right border since it may not be visible to users with low screen resolutions. 
<LI>Check the <B>Include navigation buttons</B> boxes if those sections will have site navigation elements (explained in detail on the next page). 
<LI>Click <B>OK</B> when finished. These properties can be changed by selecting <B>Format|Shared Borders...</B> again from the menu bar after the shared borders have been defined. 
</OL>
