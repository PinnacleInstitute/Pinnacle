Excel allows you to create spreadsheets much like paper ledgers that can perform automatic calculations. Each Excel file is a <B>workbook</B> that can hold many <B>worksheets</B>. The worksheet is a grid of <B>columns</B> (designated by letters) and <B>rows</B> (designated by numbers). The letters and numbers of the columns and rows (called <B>labels</B>) are displayed in gray buttons across the top and left side of the worksheet. The intersection of a column and a row is called a <B>cell</B>. Each cell on the spreadsheet has a <B>cell address</B> that is the column letter and the row number. Cells can contain either text, numbers, or mathematical formulas.
