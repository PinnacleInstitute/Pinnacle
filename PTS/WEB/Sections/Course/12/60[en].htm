<P><B> Recording A Macro</B>
<P>Macros can speed up any common editing sequence you may execute in an Excel spreadsheet. In this example we will make a simple macro that will set all the margins on the page to one inch.
<OL>
<LI>Click <B>Tools|Macro|Record New Macro</B> from the menu bar.
<BR><IMG height=212 alt="[Record Macro dialog box]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/excel/images/recordmacro.gif" width=297 vspace=5 border=1> 
<LI>Name the macro in the <B>Macro name</B> field. The name cannot contain spaces and must not begin with a number. 
<LI>If you would like to assign a shortcut key to the macro for easy use, enter the letter under <B>Shortcut key</B>. Enter a lower case letter to make a CTRL+number shortcut and enter an upper case letter to assign a CTRL+SHIFT+number shortcut key. If you select a shortcut key that Excel already uses, your macro will overwrite that function. 
<LI>Select an option from the <B>Store macro in</B> drop-down menu. 
<LI>Enter a description of the macro in the <B>Description</B> field. This is for your reference only so you remember what the macro does. 
<LI>Click <B>OK</B> when you are ready to start recording. 
<LI>Select options from the drop down menus and Excel will record the options you choose from the dialog boxes, such as changing the margins on the Page Setup window. Select <B>File|Page Setup</B> and change all the margins to 1". Press <B>OK</B>. Replace this step with whatever commands you want your macro to execute. Select only options that modify the worksheet. Toggle actions such as <B>View|Toolbars</B> that have no effect on the worksheet will not be recorded.
<BR><IMG height=49 alt="[Macro toolbar]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/excel/images/macrotoolbar.gif" width=68 vspace=5 border=1>
