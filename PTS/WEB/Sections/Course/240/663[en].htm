<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Changing Document Views</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>Word provides several different ways in which you can view your document. Document views can be changed using the <B> View</B>  buttons located at the left end of the horizontal scroll bar. You should select the view that allows you to work best with your document.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B> Normal</B>  view is the best view for typing, editing, and formatting. This view is the one that many Word users prefer.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B> Web Layout</B>  view is used for creating and editing web pages. Documents in <B> Web Layout</B>  view behave like browsers where the text wraps to fit the window.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B> Print Layout</B>  view provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) view of a document. Some commands, such as inserting text or headers and footers, require you to work in this view. This view is the default view for a new installation of Word.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B> Outline </B> view is useful in long documents that use a heading style. <B> Outline </B> view allows you to expand and collapse outline levels so that only certain heading levels appear. This view is helpful in a document containing many heading levels. The <B> Outlining</B>  toolbar automatically appears in this view. This toolbar allows you to easily reorganize a document by moving information and adjusting indent levels.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can also switch views by selecting the desired view command from the <B> View</B>  menu.When you save a document, the selected view is also saved. The next time you open the document, it will open in the same view.</FONT><FONT size=3><IMG height=142 src="http://www.jmu.edu/computing/tutorials/microsoft/word/views/viewbuttons.gif" width=226 border=0></FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Many times, it is helpful to use the ruler for referencing locations. You can display the horizontal ruler in <B> Normal </B> and <B> Print Layout</B>  view. You can use the horizontal ruler to set left and right margins and indents, as well as to add and remove tab stops.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can hide the ruler if you want to be able to view more of your document. The <B> Ruler</B>  command on the <B> View </B> menu is a toggle, which means that the same command enables and disables the feature.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>In <B> Print Layout</B>  view, you can also display a vertical ruler.

<P><FONT size=3>You can open multiple documents in Word. When you open more than one document in Word, the first document appears within the application window with its own document <B> Close Window</B>  button. All other open documents, however, appear in a Single Document Interface (SDI), meaning that each open document has its own menu, toolbar, and application window. In addition, each document gets its own button on the taskbar. In other words, each document appears within its own Word application.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can open multiple documents in the Open dialog box with the <B> [Shift]</B>  key or the <B> [Ctrl]</B>  key. When you use the <B> [Shift]</B>  key, all files between the first and last selected files in the dialog box are selected. When you use the <B> [Ctrl]</B>  key, you can select non-adjacent files in the dialog box.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When you open multiple documents in Word, the names of all open documents appear on the <B> Window</B>  menu with a checkmark indicating the active document. They also appear on the taskbar with the active document taskbar button selected.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>There are several reasons for opening multiple documents, including copying and pasting text between them as well as comparing their contents.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>If you have more than one open document, you can use the <B> Window</B>  menu or the taskbar to quickly switch between them.</FONT>
