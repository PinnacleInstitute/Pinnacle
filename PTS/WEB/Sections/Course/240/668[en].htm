<P><FONT size=3>The <B> Clips Online </B> button in the Clip Gallery window allows you to add to the Office Clip Gallery files from Microsoft's Clip Gallery Live on the Web. You may download clip art images as well as animated graphics and sounds. This process works smoothly if Internet Explorer is your default Web browser. If Netscape Navigator is your default browser, the download process is not so smooth. Two modifications to the download process are suggested at the end of the step-by-step instructions below; either of them will allow you to use the download feature when Netscape Navigator is your default browser.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><B> NOTE:</B> When Netscape Navigator is your default browser and you attempt to download clips from within the Clip Gallery as described above, you are asked to save the clips to a file instead of the clips being automatically downloaded to the Clip Gallery. There are two ways to handle this situation:</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT size=3>Save the clips to a file, renaming it if necessary so that you can remember which file contains the clips you downloaded. (The default names are not very helpful.) Once the clips have been downloaded, navigate to their location in either Windows Explorer or My Computer, and double-click on the file to open it.&amp; The downloaded clips will appear in a window (actually the <B> Downloaded Clips</B>  category).
<BR>You may then categorize the clips as described in #7 and 8 above.
<BR>
<BR></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>An easier method for working around the difficulty when Netscape is your default browser is not to download from within the Office Clip Gallery. Instead, simply open Internet Explorer and to navigate to the Clip Gallery Live page (www.microsoft.com/clipgallerylive). Choose clips and download them as described above. The Clip Gallery will be automatically opened and the clips will appear in a window. Use methods described above to place the clips in the categories in which you want them to appear.</FONT>
