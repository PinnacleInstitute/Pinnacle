<P><FONT size=3>There may be times when you want to perform a function (such as deleting, formatting, or spell checking) on a word, sentence, paragraph, or particular area of text. In order to perform this function, you must first select the text. Selecting text expands the insertion point to highlight a block of text. Text can be selected using the mouse or key combinations. Text can be selected using the white area in the left margin called the selection bar. When the mouse pointer turns into a right-hand-pointing arrow, the mouse is positioned in the selection bar. The number of times you click in this area determines the amount of text that is selected. Selecting a new text block or repositioning the insertion point deselects the original selection. You may click anywhere in the document to deselect selected text.</FONT>
