<P><FONT size=3>You can also delete selected text by selecting the <B> Edit</B>  menu and then selecting the <B> Clear </B> command.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can replace selected text simply by typing new text. This option eliminates the need to first delete text. You should be careful not to accidentally press a key while text is selected, especially when the selection does not appear in the document area. Pressing a key deletes selected text. </FONT>
