<P><FONT size=3><B>Q.</B> If you were in a club and somebody slipped a club drug into your drink, wouldn’t you realize it immediately? 
<BR><B>A.</B> Probably not. Most club drugs are odorless and tasteless. Some are made into a powder form that makes it easier to slip into a drink and dissolve without a person’s knowledge. That is why some of these drugs have been called “date rape” drugs—because there have been increasing reports of club drugs being used in sexual assaults. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Q.</B> Are there any long-term effects of taking ecstasy? 
<BR><B>A.</B> Yes. Studies on both humans and animals have proven that regular use of ecstasy produces long-lasting, perhaps permanent damage to the brain’s ability to think and store memories. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Q.</B> If you took a club drug at a rave, wouldn’t you just dance off all of its effects?
<BR><B>A.</B> Not necessarily. The stimulant effects of drugs like ecstasy that allow the user to dance for long periods of time, combined with the hot, crowded conditions usually found at raves, can lead to extreme dehydration and even heart or kidney failure. In addition, some of ecstasy’s effects, like confusion, depression, anxiety, paranoia, and sleep problems, have been reported to occur even weeks after the drug is taken. </FONT>
