<B> <FONT size=5>The Beginnings of Biofeedback</FONT>
<BR>
<BR></B> <FONT size=3>The word "biofeedback" was coined in the late 1960s to describe laboratory procedures then 
<BR>being used to train experimental research subjects to alter brain activity, blood pressure, 
<BR>heart rate, and other bodily functions that normally are not controlled voluntarily.
<BR>At the time, many scientists looked forward to the day when biofeedback would give us a 
<BR>major degree of control over our bodies. They thought, for instance, that we might be able 
<BR>to "will" ourselves to be more creative by changing the patterns of our brainwaves. Some 
<BR>believed that biofeedback would one day make it possible to do away with drug treatments 
<BR>that often cause uncomfortable side effects in patients with high blood pressure and other 
<BR>serious conditions.
<BR>
<BR>Today, most scientists agree that such high hopes were not realistic. Research has 
<BR>demonstrated that biofeedback can help in the treatment of many diseases and painful 
<BR>conditions. It has shown that we have more control over so-called involuntary bodily fun
<BR>ction than we once though possible. But it has also shown that nature limits the extent of 
<BR>such control. Scientists are now trying to determine just how much voluntary control we 
<BR>can exert.
