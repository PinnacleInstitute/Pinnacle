<H1><CENTER>What is Biofeedback?
<BR><HR></CENTER></H1>
<BR><FONT size=3>Biofeedback is a treatment technique in which people are trained to improve their health 
<BR>by using signals from their own bodies. Physical therapists use biofeedback to help stroke 
<BR>victims regain movement in paralyzed muscles. Psychologists use it to help tense and 
<BR>anxious clients learn to relax. Specialists in many different fields use biofeedback to help 
<BR>their patients cope with pain.
<BR>
<BR>Chances are you have used biofeedback yourself. You've used it if you have ever taken 
<BR>your temperature or stepped on a scale. The thermometer tells you whether you're 
<BR>running a fever, the scale whether you've gained weight. Both devices "feed back" informa
<BR>tion about your body's condition. Armed with this information, you can take steps you've 
<BR>learned to improve the condition. When you're running a fever, you go to bed and drink 
<BR>plenty of fluids. When you've gained weight, you resolve to eat less and sometimes you 
<BR>do.
<BR>
<BR>Clinicians reply on complicated biofeedback machines in somewhat the same way that you 
<BR>rely on your scale or thermometer. Their machines can detect a person's internal bodily 
<BR>functions with far greater sensitivity and precision than a person can alone. This 
<BR>information may be valuable. Both patients and therapists use it to gauge and direct the 
<BR>progress of treatment.
<BR>
<BR>For patients, the biofeedback machine acts as a kind of sixth sense which allows them to 
<BR>"see" or "hear" activity inside their bodies. One commonly used type of machine, for 
<BR>example, picks up electrical signals in the muscles. It translates these signals into a form 
<BR>that patients can detect: It triggers a flashing light bulb, perhaps, or activates a beeper every 
<BR>time muscles grow more tense. If patients want to relax tense muscles, they try to slow 
<BR>down the flashing or beeping.
<BR>
<BR>Like a pitcher learning to throw a ball across a home plate, the biofeedback trainee, in an 
<BR>attempt to improve a skill, monitors the performance. When a pitch is off the mark, the 
<BR>ballplayer adjusts the delivery so that he performs better the next time he tries. When the 
<BR>light flashes or the beeper beeps too often, the biofeedback trainee makes internal 
<BR>adjustments which alter the signals. The biofeedback therapist acts as a coach, standing at 
<BR>the sidelines setting goals and limits on what to expect and giving hints on how to 
<BR>improve performance.</FONT>
