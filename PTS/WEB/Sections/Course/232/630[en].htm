<BR>
<BR></B> <FONT size=3>Scientists cannot yet explain how biofeedback works. Most patients who benefit from 
<BR>biofeedback are trained to relax and modify their behavior. Most scientists believe that 
<BR>relaxation is a key component in biofeedback treatment of many disorders, particularly 
<BR>those brought on or made worse by stress.
<BR>Their reasoning is based on what is known about the effects of stress on the body. In brief, 
<BR>the argument goes like this: Stressful events produce strong emotions, which arouse 
<BR>certain physical responses. Many of these responses are controlled by the sympathetic 
<BR>nervous system, the network of nerve tissues that helps prepare the body to meet 
<BR>emergencies by "flight or fight."
<BR>
<BR>The typical pattern of response to emergencies probably emerged during the time when all 
<BR>humans faced mostly physical threats. Although the "threats" we now live with are 
<BR>seldom physical, the body reacts as if they were: The pupils dilate to let in more light. Sweat 
<BR>pours out, reducing the chance of skin cuts. Blood vessels near the skin contract to reduce 
<BR>bleeding, while those in the brain and muscles dilate to increase the oxygen supply. The 
<BR>gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and intestines, slows down to reduce the 
<BR>energy expensed in digestion. The heart beats faster, and blood pressure rises.
<BR>Normally, people calm down when a stressful event is over especially if they have done 
<BR>something to cope with it. For instance, imagine your own reactions if you're walking 
<BR>down a dark street and hear someone running toward you. You get scared. Your body p
<BR>repared you to ward off an attacker or run fast enough to get away. When you do escape, 
<BR>you gradually relax.
<BR>
<BR>If you get angry at your boss, it's a different matter. Your body may prepare to fight. But 
<BR>since you want to keep your job, you try to ignore the angry feelings. Similarly, if on the 
<BR>way home you get stalled in traffic, there's nothing you can do to get away. These situations 
<BR>can literally may you sick. Your body has prepared for action, but you cannot act.
<BR>Individuals differ in the way they respond to stress. In some, one function, such as blood 
<BR>pressure, becomes more active while others remain normal. Many experts believe that 
<BR>these individual physical responses to stress can become habitual. When the body is 
<BR>repeatedly aroused, one or more functions may become permanently overactive. Actual 
<BR>damage to bodily tissues may eventually result.
<BR>
<BR>Biofeedback is often aimed at changing habitual reactions to stress that can cause pain or 
<BR>disease. Many clinicians believe that some of their patients and clients have forgotten how 
<BR>to relax. Feedback of physical responses such as skin temperature and muscle tension 
<BR>provides information to help patients recognize a relaxed state. The feedback signal may 
<BR>also act as a kind of reward for reducing tension. It's like a piano teacher whose frown 
<BR>turns to a smile when a young musician finally plays a tune properly.
<BR>
<BR>The value of a feedback signal as information and reward may be even greater in the 
<BR>treatment of patients with paralyzed or spastic muscles. With these patients, biofeedback 
<BR>seems to be primarily a form of skill training like learning to pitch a ball. Instead of 
<BR>watching the ball, the patient watches the machine, which monitors activity in the affected 
<BR>muscle. Stroke victims with paralyzed arms and legs, for example, see that some part of 
<BR>their affected limbs remains active. The signal from the biofeedback machine proves it. 
<BR>This signal can guide the exercises that help patients regain use of their limbs. Perhaps just 
<BR>as important, the feedback convinces patients that the limbs are still alive. This reassurance 
<BR>often encourages them to continue their efforts.</FONT>
