<B> <FONT size=5>How is Biofeedback Used Today?</FONT>
<BR>
<BR></B> <FONT size=3>Clinical biofeedback techniques that grew out of the early laboratory procedures are now 
<BR>widely used to treat an ever-lengthening list of conditions. These include: </FONT>

<LI><FONT size=3>·Migraine headaches, tension headaches, and many other types of pain </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>·Disorders of the digestive system </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>·High blood pressure and its opposite, low blood pressure </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>·Cardiac arrhythmias (abnormalities, sometimes dangerous, in the rhythm of the heartbeat) </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>·Raynaud's disease (a circulatory disorder that causes uncomfortably cold hands) </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>·Epilepsy </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>·Paralysis and other movement disorders </FONT>
</UL><FONT size=3>Specialists who provide biofeedback training range from psychiatrists and psychologists to 
<BR>dentists, internists, nurses, and physical therapists. Most rely on many other techniques in 
<BR>addition to biofeedback. Patients usually are taught some form of relaxation exercise. Some 
<BR>learn to identify the circumstances that trigger their symptoms. They may also be taught 
<BR>how to avoid or cope with these stressful events. Most are encouraged to change their 
<BR>habits, and some are trained in special techniques for gaining such self-control. Biofeedback 
<BR>is not magic. It cannot cure disease or by itself make a person healthy. It is a tool, one of 
<BR>many available to health care professionals. It reminds physicians that behavior, thoughts, 
<BR>and feelings profoundly influence physical health. And it helps both patients and doctors 
<BR>understand that they must work together as a team.</FONT>

<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Biofeedback places unusual demands on patients. They must examine their day-to-day 
<BR>lives to learn if they may be contributing to their own distress. They must recognize that 
<BR>they can, by their own efforts, remedy some physical ailments. They must commit th
<BR>emselves to practicing biofeedback or relaxation exercises every day. They must change bad 
<BR>habits, even ease up on some good ones. Most important, they must accept much of the 
<BR>responsibility for maintaining their own health.</FONT>
