<P align=left>Setting Goals for Success:</FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT> 
<P align=left>Do I need goal setting? </B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>How much success do you want? Many athletes achieve some 
<P align=left>success without using formal goal setting, but virtually every great athlete who 
<P align=left>consistently wins uses some form of goal setting. Based on our experience, the USOC 
<P align=left>Sport Psychology program believes that </FONT><I><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>using goal setting is as necessary as having a 
<P align=left>coach</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>.</FONT><B><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT> 
<P align=left>How does goal getting help? </B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>Like have a coach, good goal setting gives you an edge in 
<P align=left>three areas: 
<P align=left>1) Direction – Goals tell you where you need to go and help guide you there. 
<P align=left>2) Feedback – Goals tell you when you are making progress. 
<P align=left>3) Support – Goals help to keep you going.</FONT><B><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT> 
<P align=left>What happens if I don’t use goal setting? </B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>A lot of athletes say, "Hey, why should I do 
<P align=left>goal setting when things are going so well?" If things are going well, you may not notice 
<P align=left>the absence of goal setting right away. It’s when things start going poorly, however, that 
<P align=left>the athlete who does good goal setting can correct things and avoid a slump. Remember, 
<P align=left>good goal setting gives you direction, feedback, and support, three important tools when 
<P align=left>you are trying to avoid a slump.</FONT><B><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT> 
<P align=left>What is effective goal setting? </B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>Truth be told, we are what we do. </FONT><I><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>Our behavior is the 
<P align=left>key</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>. A motivational speech is useless unless people behave differently because of it. 
<P align=left>Reading self-help books, talking about making changes in your life, attending retreats are 
<P align=left>wastes of time unless the end result is a change in behavior. </FONT><I><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>Thus, effective goal setting 
<P align=left>is a process that results in a behavioral change.</I></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT> 
<P align=left>Athletes who use goal setting effectively find a number of behavioral changes including: 
<P align=left>a) Training is more productive, with more done in less time. 
<P align=left>b) Focused competition behavior, resulting in less nervousness at competitions 
<P align=left>c) Athletes avoid plateaus, moving constantly forward in their training.</FONT><B><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT> 
<P align=left>Effective goal setting becomes a habit. </B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>Like other behaviors that take some effort, goal 
<P align=left>setting needs to become a habit, or it fades away. When goal setting become an 
<P align=left>automatic part of your day, it will be most helpful to you.</FONT><B><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT> 
<P align=left>Effective goal setting pays more attention to the little goals than the big goals. </B></FONT><FONT face=TimesNewRomanPSMT>"If 
<P align=left>you want to climb a mountain you must begin by taking a single step." Setting big goals 
<P align=left>is easy. Developing a plan to reach those goals is hard. Effective goal setting begins 
<P align=left>when you get past the big goals and start to build yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily 
<P align=left>goals that get you to where you want to go. It takes work, and it needs to be a continual 
<P align=left>process, but it can work wonders in your life.</FONT></FONT>
