<P>Process: 
<UL>
<LI>Sort wedding plans for the next day by time. Except on weekends, when you sort wedding plans by Chapel (Victorian, Heritage, and Magnolia) and time. 
<LI>Verify that the wedding plans are reflected on the schedule for that day. If the wedding plans are not present in both places, research to find out why, and where the original paperwork for the wedding is located to rectify the situation. 
<LI>If unable to locate original wedding plan, print another for the file and write "Copy" on it across the top.
<LI>Copies of Lake Las Vegas wedding plans will be filed in a separate folder by date and time.
<LI>Confirm that each wedding plan is the most updated version on file compared to that on the schedule. If the two do not match, print the wedding plan reflected on the schedule.
<LI>Verify if the bride and groom have paid for the wedding in full or if the wedding plan was booked by an affiliate (which is to be billed at a later date). Also check to see if there are any credits to be applied to the couple due to changes made on the wedding plan.
<LI>Ensure that wedding plans which require limo service have a hotel and room number assigned. (If not known at time of reservation, put "Will Advise" in the hotel field.) Any notes regarding extra time on grounds, First Look, pick up or drop off locations and a change in room numbers need to be annotated.
<LI>Call couples that have balances due and those for whom no hotel or room number are listed. Congratulate them and welcome them to Las Vegas. Confirm their reservation and schedule a consultation. Try to gain the required information and payment.
<LI>When calling to confirm wedding plan, ensure that couples have their marriage license for the day of the wedding.
<LI>If ribbons are attached to the wedding plan on file for the bridal flower arrangements, make sure that they are then attached to the floral run slips near the names of the respective bride and groom.
<LI>If cakes are ordered, make sure that there is a confirmation attached to the wedding plan, indicating that the order was faxed and confirmed. 
<LI>Ensure with the off site vendors (Elvis, Sundance Helicopter, Organists, Lake Las Vegas, etc.) that their services are confirmed and that appropriate notes are made on the wedding plan for the appropriate departments and personnel.
<LI>For wedding plans that have Internet services and archives (other than Live Viewing), ensure that the information and time requested is uploaded on the wedding plan (and updated). All times to be in military time format.
<LI>Once all wedding plans and notes are current and updated, make sure that a new printed copy is made
