<P align=justify>The Healing Power of Energy</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The basic unit of life, the cell, exists only because it is held together by energy. The atoms and molecules that make up a cell also exist because their various parts are held together by a bond of energy. Essentially, everything in the universe as we understand it is energy, manifesting in light and sound.&nbsp; Perhaps, as Einstein believed, there is only a single energy, "a unified field," but if so, it has countless faces. Numerous cultures describe a matrix of subtle energies that support, shape, and animate the physical body, called Chi in Chinese, Prana in India and Tibet, Nefesh in Hebrew, Ki in Japan.&nbsp; Sufis call it "Baraka", Christians call it the Holy Spirit ("Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you"), and the ancient Greeks called it "pneuma".&nbsp; Hahnemann, the father of homeopathy, referred to it as the "vital force," and chiropractic calls it the "innate intelligence." Your body is made up of "energy fields" that form the foundation of your health. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Modem medicine uses only "vitality" but has no concept of a circuit for this vitality. Ukrainian quantum physicists, on the other hand, have been studying Giga&#8209;energy. They report that human DNA vibrates at 52 to 78 Gigahertz (billions of cycles per second); animals at 47 Gigahertz; and plants at 42 Gigahertz. They believe that this subtle energy, at one&#8209;billionth of a watt per cm<SUP>2</SUP>, is the electromagnetic support system for "chi." This chi correlates almost identically to what traditional Jewish sources refer to as the Nefesh level of soul within the body. In the Bible (Lev. 17: 11) it is written that "the soul (Nefesh) of the flesh is in the blood. "According to the Chinese classics, the chi is called the "commander of the blood." As it is clear from Lev. 17:11, the Nefesh (chi) is the life force of the body. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">According to the Aurevedic medical system of India, your body has seven major centers of both electromagnetic activity and vital energy (commonly known as <B>chakras) </B>that are powerhouses of energy. Studies have been conducted that show the electrical oscillations in the skin above the chakras are in the frequency of up to 1,600 cycles per second &#8209; as contrasted with 0 to 100 in the brain, 225 in the muscles, and 250 in the heart. (Study by Dr. Valerie Hunt professor emeritus at UCLA, summarized in Richard Gerber's book , <I>Vibrational Medicine.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Each chakra is associated with a color as shown in the diagram below.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Each chakra influences the organs, muscles, ligaments, veins, and all other systems within its energy field. Chakras also influence the endocrine system and so are strongly involved with your moods, personality, and overall health. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>According to the theory of Chinese acupuncture, your body also consists of an "energy transportation system" known as <B>meridians. </B>These meridians not only feed vital energies to their related organs, they also reflect any pathological disturbance in those organs, thus providing physicians with a convenient and highly accurate tool for diagnosis as well as therapy. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG style="WIDTH: 175px; HEIGHT: 304px" height=372 alt=meridians.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/348/meridians.jpg" width=202 align=baseline border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>According to the book <I>Energy Medicine, </I>disturbances in meridian energies correlate with ill health. Because disrupted meridian energies often precede illness, meridian readings are sometimes used to predict health vulnerabilities and prevent disease.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Dr. Candace Pert, a research professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C., believes that the meridians may be the pathways that are followed by immune cells as they move up and down an anatomical highway. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>According to the Jewish theory of healing, your body has 10 <B>sefirot </B>(spiritual energy centers). This energy enters the field of the body at the Crown (Keter) through the area of the fontanel the "soft spot" on an infant's skull. Jewish sages also believed that a field of energy called Surrounding Light (the Aura) envelopes the human body. This Light extends 88 inches from the physical body and works like an ozone layer. The ozone layer protects living creatures from ultraviolet radiation emitted from the sun. Surrounding Light works in a similar capacity, shielding us from negative forces in&nbsp; our environment. When we behave with intolerance toward others and with egocentric behavior, we literally punch holes in our Surrounding Light, creating openings for illness to enter into our bodies. Christians depict this Surrounding Light as the halo surrounding the head of saints and angels. </FONT>

<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The body's energy centers &#8209; meridians, chakras or sefirot (depending upon one's belief system) &#8209; bring vital life energy to every organ in your body. Keeping these energy fields balanced and removing blockages in the flow of this subtle energy plays a major role in determining your body's health. Balance is the key concept within energy wellness, just as homeostasis is a key concept within biology.&nbsp; All systems move toward an energetic balance, a state of harmony with other energies. <B>A primary benefit of the EnergyWellness instrument is to help balance the energy fields in your body!</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">During the first few years Of the 21st Century we will witness a grassroots explosion across America where people will begin taking responsibility for their wellness lifestyle, with optimum plant&#8209;based nutrition, antioxidant, botanical and nutrient supplementation, exercise, positive thinking, stress management, and demands for clean air, ecological sustainability (saving the rainforests, etc.), pure water, organic foods and a change toward a preventive natural health care system ... while rejecting pharmaceutical &#8209; based medical solutions.&nbsp; People are fed up with the failure of modern medicine to solve chronic diseases, such as cancer.</FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Rife discovered that every virus, bacterium, parasite and other pathogens is particularly sensitive to a specific “frequency” of sound and can be destroyed by intensifying that frequency until it literally explodes - like an intense musical note that can shatter a wine glass!&nbsp; To “disintegrate” the microbes, Rife invented a Beam Ray machine (now known as a Rife machine), the forerunner of today’s EnergyWellness instrument. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>EnergyWellness technology uses two distinctly different types of frequencies: microbe and tissue, both for prevention and remission of disease.&nbsp; Microbe frequencies are used in experiments for destruction of pathogens - disease organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, amoebae, etc.&nbsp;Tissue frequencies are believed to activate normal cell functions (repair, regeneration, production of various metabolites secretion, etc.).&nbsp; Each type of microbe has its own unique electronic signature - a distinct molecular oscillation pattern that is a result of genetics.&nbsp; Frequencies used on a specific organism are based on this electronic signature.&nbsp; Because this frequency pattern is as unique as its genetic fingerprint, it affects ONLY that type of organism.&nbsp; Everything else is left untouched. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Several different types of weak field disturbances in the earth's energy field can disrupt functions of DNA. These are collectively referred to as "geopathic radiation". Examples of such include x-rays, power lines, microwave ovens, computers, and radioactivity. Geopathic radiation causes gradual genetic degeneration. Over a period of years, it seriously disrupts metabolism in both plants and animals, by preventing the repair of DNA.&nbsp; The correlation between cancer and geopathic stress is close to 100%. This does not mean that geopathic radiation directly causes cancer - it does not directly cause any disease. It only causes the metabolic degeneration that encourages disease.&nbsp; The body is left defenseless against all parasites including the cancer virus as a result of geopathic radiation, because it disrupts normal metabolism and weakens the immune system, much like radioactivity or a carcinogen. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>It is now known that geopathic radiation not only makes recovery from any illness difficult or impossible, but may be the underlying cause of many illnesses. It may take several years for a geopathically stressed individual to recover completely. Geopathic radiation impairs DNA functioning and damages the immune system.&nbsp;Clearly, raw food, water, sun and exercise are all valuable allies in the effort to repair metabolic damage. </FONT>
