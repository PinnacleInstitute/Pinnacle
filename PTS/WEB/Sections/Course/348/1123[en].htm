<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Tips on Using the EnergyWellness Unit </B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Bio-active frequencies are safe to use, because each frequency affects only one type of organism, <I>and is harmless to anything with a different genetic code. </I>Since every variety of organism has a unique genetic code, every organism requires a different frequency. This is important because many different organisms </FONT></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">attack the same tissues, and may cause identical symptoms. It is hard to know which organism is causing the problem, even with current lab techniques.</FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Since each organism is affected by a different frequency, it is important to use the frequencies or auto code listed for that problem in the Auto Code list.&nbsp; If you cannot find a particular problem listed,&nbsp;please contact EnergyWellness for assistance.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Unlike antibiotics, the frequencies are harmless. You can use as many as you want, as long as the speed at which your body removes toxins is tolerable . It is suggested that you work with only one problem per day until you achieve positive results.&nbsp; Please remember, your problem likely didn't start yesterday!&nbsp; It likely will not disappear tomorrow.&nbsp; The key to success is a dilligent committment to daily use of your EW unit and drinking a sufficient amount of water to flush your system of toxins and cellular wastes. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">It is important to begin with the Detoxification (Detox) Auto Code, Auto 237 to help your body detoxify. A total of six sessions is optimal. Scheduling the sessions can be flexible, according to your daily routine. You may do a morning session and an evening session on Day 1, skip Day 2, repeat morning and evening sessions on Day 3, etc. You may choose to only schedule one session per day, for six days. After your sixth session, skip two days, then begin with the Auto Codes for the condition you want to work with first.</FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Identify the problem you want to work with first. From the list of Auto Codes, select the problem/code which best describes your problem. If there is more than one code listed for your problem, experiment with each code listed and determine which produces the best results. For example, there are five Auto Codes listed for Arthritis. You may rotate through each of the five Codes. If you are doing 2 sessions per day, you may use Auto 154 in the morning and Auto 155 in the evening on Day 1, Auto 156 in the morning and Auto 157 in the evening on Day 3, Auto 158 in the morning and Auto 154 in the evening on Day 5, then rest for two days and repeat the rotation until you achieve desired results. Do not hesitate to call/communicate with your distributor regarding selection of the best frequency/code for your problem. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Proper positioning of the electrodes is equally as important as selecting the correct frequency.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT size=1><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3><B>Electrode - </B></FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3>Any appliance attached to the body for the conduction of energy or frequency into the body. <B>Hand cylinders</B>: be sure to touch all fingertips, including thumb, to allow proper conduction through the&nbsp;hands and arms.&nbsp; Use electrodes with the hands when any of these organs are involved:</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Foot Plates</B> (flats): All toes and balls of the feet should touch the plates to allow proper conduction through the feet and legs. Moisten the terry cloth sleeves and place the foot plates inside. The moisture enhances conduction. You may use a plastic trash bag under the moistened sleeves to protect carpet or upholstery. </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Assume a comfortable position, such that the feet will firmly rest on the foot plates.&nbsp; Use flats on the feet&nbsp;when these organs are involved:</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>When possi</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>ble, <B>direct application</B> may be preferable. Hand cylinders or foot plates&nbsp;may be used, depending on the area involved.&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face=Arial><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>Generally, the easiest way to deliver frequencies to an afflicted organ is to hold the cylinders in the hands, or rest the feet on the metal plates. The energy pathways (meridians) in the hands and feet distribute frequencies all over the body. But sometimes, these energy pathways are blocked by tiny scars or toxins. Then they are unable to carry frequencies to the target area.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore, the best method of delivery to a targeted area, is direct </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">application of electrodes directly over and behind an afflicted organ. This eliminates the risk of a blocked meridian failing to carry frequencies to that organ. </FONT></FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Be sure the afflicted area lies exactly on an imaginary straight line drawn between the two electrodes. Even slight deviations in placing the electrodes can mean the </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">difference between success and failure.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Loosely-applied electrodes may sting, if there are slight gaps between skin and electrode, or if the subject shifts position. Therefore, secure the foot plates flat and firm against the skin with ACE elastic bandages, athletic sweatbands or velcro bandages. Or you may prefer to lie in a prone position on top of one foot plate, with the other foot plate on top of you.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">You may experience a tingling sensation when using the&nbsp;cylinders in your hands.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">You may be unable to feel tingling when applying frequencies to the feet and larger areas of the body. </FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Remember, your feet have most likely been highly abused over the years and as a result become very insensitive to external stimuli. </FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The thick calloused sole of the foot can block the weak&nbsp;frequencies from the electrodes. Also, the extra&nbsp;&nbsp;d</FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">istance and tissue volume from one leg to the other dissipates more energy than in the upper&nbsp;torso.&nbsp; It is not necessary to feel a tingling sensation in order for the frequencies to be effective.&nbsp; The old cliche "no pain, no gain" is not applicable here.</FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><B>Broadcast Mode</B> —Place instrument anywhere in a room preferably center. It will effectively broadcast frequencies up to 36 feet through as many individuals that are within the 36 foot circumference range. Extend the cables with cylinders attached as far to the right and left of the instrument as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Turn the intensity as high as possible.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Run the suggested frequency for 6 minutes per frequency, not the 3 minute default time (which is preprogrammed for each Auto Code).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Keep all appliances in the area off (ie., TV, VCR, etc.) while using the broadcast mode (or at least 8 feet from same while turned on).&nbsp; This method can also be used while sleeping at night.&nbsp; Place one hand cylinder at the head of your bed, perhaps in the top of your pillow case, and the other between the sheets at the extreme foot of your bed.&nbsp; Turn the intensity as high as possible.&nbsp; Run the code of your choice for 9 - 12 min per frequency, as long as the speed at which your body removes toxins is tolerable.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Individual acute/chronic&nbsp;problems such as cancer, parasites, hepatitis, etc. achieve best results by direct body contact.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The broadcast method&nbsp;is suggested for use with infants and small children.&nbsp; You may place the unit on the floor under the crib, with one cable and cylinder extending through the legs of the head of the crib and the other cable and cylinder extending through the legs of the foot of the crib.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Electro-magnets, electrostatic, scala, or ‘hyper-dimensional energies’ instrumentation use this approach just as effectively as our EnergyWellness unit.</FONT></FONT><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=Arial><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">For the body to function properly, it must be hydrated properly. Water regulates the body’s temperature and assists in digestion. It removes toxins from the body and also makes necessary body fluids. As chemical reactions that support life take place in a water medium, one can say the chemistry of life is water chemistry. The quality and properties of the water we drink determine the quality of our health.</FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>Drainage </B>refers to the removal of cellular waste and toxins from the body. One achieves drainage by drinking an adequate amount of water daily. To comfortably consume adequate amounts of water, you may want to drink two glasses of water prior to your meals and two glasses before bedtime. To determine the amount of water you should consume while using programs, multiply your body weight by 70%, ie. if you weigh 150 pounds, (150 X .7 = 105 ounces) you need approximately&nbsp;thirteen 8 oz.glasses per day. Water is most effective in flushing toxins and waste from the body when drank on an empty stomach.</FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Water is water!! There are those that propose water must be purified, distilled or treated with Reverse Osmosis to be optimally effective in </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">removing toxins and waste. However, there are users who will not make this extra effort. Therefore, water of what ever nature is better than no water at all. <B>DRAINAGE IS CRITICAL!</B></FONT></FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">If these wastes are not removed from the body regularly, a build-up occurs which intensifies the symptoms you were experiencing and may even cause additional </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">symptoms to occur.&nbsp; </FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">If symptoms become worse, flush toxins out with more drinking water, use the detox program and skip a session, if necessary. The detox program is so important it should be added to any schedule of programs. Whether used on an infection or on a toxic exposure, these frequencies may be very useful in speeding recovery.</FONT></FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>A temporary increase in symptoms can be a good sign!</FONT></FONT></B><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3>When organisms die, their internal toxins are released as they disintegrate. These toxins can create the same symptoms as the problem.&nbsp; <FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Although feeling worse can mean drinking water was neglected, it's probably a very good sign. It means you have found the frequency that will kill the organism causing the disease.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT face=Tahoma><FONT size=3></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><B>How long do I use these programs?</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">When the immune system has been devastated by drugs, a suggested schedule is to continue sessions once every 3 days, for three times as long as it took for all symptoms to disappear.</FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">With very serious conditions, it is wise to continue periodic use on a regular basis as&nbsp;protection against recurrence or relapse, ie. once weekly</FONT></FONT> 
<P align=justify><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">With malignant tumors, it is important to continue regular preventive sessions (once weekly)&nbsp;as insurance against development of secondary tumors.
