<OL>
<LI><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>you understand and summarise the facts of the situation</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>you indicate your feelings towards the situation</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size=2>you state your requirements, reasons and benefits to the other party, if appropriate.</FONT>

Note there are no such attributions as <I>'You are deliberately annoying me'</I>, there are no swear words, there are no put-downs of the other person. The emphasis is on indicating how you feel and thereby seeking to gain a positive rather than an aggressive response from the other person.</FONT>
