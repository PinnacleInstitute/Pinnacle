<P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Many average salespeople spend more time planning their weekends than their sales approach.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it's fun!&nbsp; Successful salespeople know how to turn sales into a game that meets the needs of all the players.&nbsp; They've done their research.&nbsp; They've practiced, and now they're ready to play.
<P>Just like a professional football team creates their game plan:<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>1) decides on specific goals (10 yards, 50 yards, a touchdown, etc.)
<P>2) plans their "plays" visually
<P>3) strategizes the best way to complete those plays
<P>4)&nbsp;gets in the game,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>you, too must create a game plan.&nbsp; One that fits your personal style and achieves your goal.&nbsp; How?
<P dir=ltr>First, decide on what it is you want to achieve with each appointment you make.&nbsp; Sell one item?&nbsp; Sell multiple items?&nbsp; Sell a specific&nbsp;dollar value?&nbsp; Set your specific outcome first.
<P dir=ltr>Using the acronym, <B> IDEAS<SUP>R</SUP></B> , you'll move quickly through your planning stage and be able to get in the game!

<P dir=ltr>Identify all the benefits of your product or service.&nbsp; Not just what it does, but what value your buyer will get from it.&nbsp; Write down every possible benefit someone might receive from your product or service, even the ones you think are boring or weird.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P dir=ltr>Differentiate your product or service from others.&nbsp; What makes yours different?&nbsp; Special?&nbsp; Unique?&nbsp; Remarkable?&nbsp; Attractive?&nbsp; Does it look different?&nbsp; Feel different?&nbsp; Taste different?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P dir=ltr>Emote your product or service.&nbsp; Put yourself in your buyer's shoes.&nbsp; What emotions would a person need to experience in order to want or need your product or service?&nbsp; How might they be feeling?&nbsp; Make a list of all the feelings surrounding your product or service...even the silly ones.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><B> <FONT size=4>A</FONT></B> pproach<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P dir=ltr>Approach each emotion with a different sales presentation.&nbsp; Consider how the buyer might be feeling, what benefits best fit with that emotion, and why your product or service best satisfies that emotion.&nbsp; How might they feel after they have purchased or experienced what you're selling?&nbsp; In other words, determine why someone needs a product or service similar to yours, and why they <I> desperately</I>  need yours!&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr><FONT size=4><B> S</B></FONT>ee<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P dir=ltr>See the big picture.&nbsp; Tie your emotional sales presentation to a visual picture that you can share with your buyers as you discuss their needs and how your product or service meets those needs.&nbsp; Giving someone a visual picture of how your product or service will change their life for the better or save them from a disaster&nbsp; creates a winning sales approach.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>How does all this really work?&nbsp; Well, let's say you're selling&nbsp;homeowner's insurance policies.&nbsp; Why insurance?&nbsp; Because it's not traditionally a "fun" topic.&nbsp; If you can make insurance fun, just&nbsp;think of what you can do with cars,&nbsp;jewelry,&nbsp;or vacation packages!&nbsp; Ready to make selling insurance fun?
<P dir=ltr>Select one benefit from your list that you find most fascinating and begin implementing the <B> IDEAS<SUP>R</SUP></B>  approach:
<P dir=ltr>1.&nbsp; IDENTIFY a benefit - financial protection, no wait, that's boring.&nbsp; Hmmmm, worry-free living!&nbsp; Now that's a benefit.
<P dir=ltr>2.&nbsp; DIFFERENTIATE - policies can only be cancelled by the policy owner, not the insurance company.&nbsp; This is your unique selling proposition.
<P dir=ltr>3.&nbsp; EMOTE - fear of loss
<P dir=ltr>4.&nbsp; APPROACH - "Enjoy your life,&nbsp;worry-free.&nbsp; We've got you covered."
<P dir=ltr>5.&nbsp; SEE - "You know how when it's raining and you put up your umbrella you feel safe and secure knowing that you're protected from the elements?&nbsp; Well, picture us a huge umbrella surrounding and protecting your home."
<P dir=ltr>Easy, right?&nbsp; Now plan your "plays".&nbsp; Repeat the <B> IDEAS<SUP>R</SUP></B> process to create an approach for each customer emotion on your list.
