Returning to our football analogy, most plays are created around finding the bet path, the one with the least resistance, the one that will get you closest to your goal.&nbsp; It's easier than you think when you know who and what you are looking for.
<P>By creating your game plan using IDEAS<SUP>R</SUP>&nbsp;you have a clear understanding of what you offer.&nbsp; Now you need to determine who is most likely to want or need your service?&nbsp; Reviewing past sales history for your company is a good place to start, just as the best athletes review previous game tapes to determine what the other team is most likely to do.
<P>Strategizing involves determing who will need your product or service, when they will need it, and how you will position yourself to assist at that critical moment.&nbsp; In other words, how do you find the people who are ready, willing, and able to buy and are comfortable and happy to work with you?
<P>Who knows your customers?&nbsp; What types of people would spend time with your customers professionally?&nbsp; Socially?&nbsp; What would it take to create a relationship with these Centers of Influence who have the ability to introduce you to your ideal customers over and over again?
<P>Instead of saying, "my ideal customer is anyone who..." create a profile of your ideal customer.&nbsp; Male or female?&nbsp; Young or old?&nbsp; Single or married?&nbsp; The more detailed your profile is, the more you'll learn about where to find him or her.&nbsp; Create a visual picture in your mind of the type of person who will most benefit from your product and service, can afford it, and will be most open to hearing more about it.
<P>Where does your customer live?&nbsp; Eat?&nbsp; Work?&nbsp; Sleep?&nbsp; Play?&nbsp; Brainstorm as many thoughts about your ideal customer and his/her lifestyle.&nbsp; Each thought provides you an entry path, a path of least resistance, to meeting and entertaining your ideal client with your visual sales story.&nbsp; Develop a networking strategy for connecting with your ideal customer.
<P>Who shares your customers?&nbsp; This is where the real fun begins.&nbsp; Think about connections.&nbsp; Then think about connections again.&nbsp; Make a list of all the people you know and identify any similarities or complementary offerings.&nbsp; Even if you're not sure how or what you could offer, write it down...great ideas will come to you.
<P>Following our homeowner's insurance example from our previous lesson, here's a brief list of complementary connections you might make:
<P>1.&nbsp; Realtors
<P>2.&nbsp; Mortgage lenders
<P>3.&nbsp; Business brokers
<P>4.&nbsp; Automobile sales representatives
<P>5.&nbsp; Builders/Contractors
<P>6.&nbsp; Plumbers
<P>7.&nbsp; Electricians
<P>8.&nbsp; Appliance retailers/wholesalers
<P>9.&nbsp; Electronics retailers/wholesalers
<P>10.&nbsp; Furniture retailers/wholesalers
<P>Were you able to make the connections on all of these?&nbsp; Who else could you add?&nbsp; In this case, anything that might be placed in a home would be covered under the insurance umbrella.&nbsp; Who might you connect with for your product or service?&nbsp; Be creative.&nbsp; The more creative you become, the more unique your services will be perceived.
<P>Whew!&nbsp; I'm proud of you for getting this far.&nbsp; It means you're now ready to put your plan into play.&nbsp; Getting to know your customer and creating the visual&nbsp;"WOW" factor is next.
