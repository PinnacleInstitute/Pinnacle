A few months ago I committed to an outdoor experience requiring me to use a tent.&nbsp; So I did what anyone faced with this situation might do and went to the store to buy a tent.&nbsp; I soon realized, however, that there are a gazillion kinds of tents.&nbsp; I was bombarded with questions from the sales associate- what kinds of events did I want to use the tent for?&nbsp; How big did my tent need to be?&nbsp; How often did I plan to use it?&nbsp; What characteristics was I looking for in a tent?&nbsp; How much did I want it to weigh? 
<P>When I said I wasn't sure, he began telling me all about the different types and uses of tents.&nbsp; He showed me how easy&nbsp;they were to set up.&nbsp; He bombarded me with information about his product&nbsp; When I left the store, my head was swimming.&nbsp; I didn't buy a tent that night.&nbsp; I visited several other stores and finally bought one online. 
<P>I'm sure the salesman was frustrated with me, or maybe he never even noticed I was gone, so thick was his passion for tents.&nbsp; I never felt a connection or loyalty to return to him for my purchase, resulting in this very knowledgeable, very passionate salesperson losing a sale.&nbsp; How did that happen? 
<P>Making a purchase from a salesperson doesn't need to be overwhelming.&nbsp; I didn't need to feel frustrated.&nbsp; I didn't need a tent seminar.&nbsp; I needed an easy process.&nbsp; I needed to fulfill my goal and feel good about my choice.&nbsp; I needed to "see" myself setting up my tent at a campsite, crawling into my awesome tent at the end of the evening, waking up in my cozy tent well rested and energized for the next day. 
<P>The salesperson didn't know I needed that, didn't know how to create that for me, and ultimately lost the sale.&nbsp; If you've ever lost a sale, it may be for this very reason.&nbsp; That's why Visual Selling is critical approach.
