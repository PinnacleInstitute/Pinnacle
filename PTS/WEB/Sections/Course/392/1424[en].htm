What does "selling mean"?&nbsp; Remember the tent story in our first lesson?&nbsp; The salesperson thought selling meant he had to show me everything he had to offer.&nbsp; He thought I needed to know the intimate details of each tent they carried.&nbsp; He thought enthusiasm alone would sway me to buy from him.
<P>What does "selling" mean to you?&nbsp; Solving problems?&nbsp; Winning?&nbsp; Filling a need?&nbsp; Commissions?&nbsp; Basing your sales approach on the pursuit of money will greatly hinder your success.&nbsp; Not that commissions are important to great salespeople, they are!&nbsp; There's more to selling than money.&nbsp; Let me explain.
<P>Outstanding salespeople are passionate about the needs they fill, the problems they solve, and the customers they choose to do this for.&nbsp; Choose?&nbsp; Yes, the customers they choose.&nbsp; When you created your visual profile of your ideal customer in our previous lesson, you were choosing who you want to work with.
<P>How do outstanding salespeople show their passion and close business?&nbsp; By learning about their customers, implementing their strategies, and sharing their IDEAS<SUP>R</SUP>.
<P>Relationship selling may be a new buzz word, but to seasoned sales professionals, it's simply the only way to do business and guarantee a successful return on your efforts.&nbsp; Take a look at the table below to see some of the differences between an average salesperson and an outstanding one.

<P>The more you know about your customer and&nbsp;their needs, the easier it is to create a picture of what your product or service can do for them.&nbsp; Collaborate with the customer to find the best option to fill their need, then ask them to buy.
<P>Do outstanding salespeople win every sale every time?
<P>No.&nbsp; Here's what they do win, though:
<P>1.&nbsp; Outstanding salespeople separate their selling from themselves.&nbsp; This gives them a higher tolerance for rejection.&nbsp; When they hear "no", they pick themselves up and come back around with new ideas, options, and closing techniques.&nbsp; Remember when we created all those different approaches to address different emotions?&nbsp; Here's where you use those!
<P>2.&nbsp; Outstanding salespeople create relationships with their Centers of Influence, prospects, and customers.&nbsp; If someone isn't ready to buy now the outstanding salesperson stays in contact with them while moving on to someone who is ready to buy.&nbsp; Who knows when that contact will be ready?&nbsp; You'll know that they'll contact you when they are if the relationship exists.&nbsp; Who knows when that contact might become a Center of Influence?&nbsp; Again, you'll be positioned to be a great resource for them.
<P>3.&nbsp; Outstanding salespeople gain a learning process for constant improvement to take their sales skills to the next level.&nbsp; Well, you've already mastered this by taking this course!&nbsp; Now visualize yourself going farther and selling more.&nbsp; Picture it and you will create it!
<P>Relationship selling is more about determining who the customer is and who he or she will become after purchasing your product or service than simply peddling your wares.&nbsp; In fact, sometimes telling a prospect they're not ready for your product or service inspires them to become ready!
<P>Increasing your sales and income requires involvement.&nbsp; It's not about tackling prospects, it's not about thinking everyone needs your product or service, it's about creating a relationship with people.&nbsp; People who need your product or service.&nbsp; People who may know someone who needs your product or service.&nbsp; People who will need your product or service at a future time.&nbsp; People who can "see" what you have to offer.
<P>Involvement requires good follow through skills.&nbsp; When you meet someone and receive their contact information, contact them!&nbsp; I know this sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how many people never contact someone because they "think" that person isn't a good resource.&nbsp; I imagine these people, poor souls, have a room in their home they reserve solely for business cards.&nbsp; When they get home, they shove the door open to reveal stacks and stacks of cards.&nbsp; Then they empty their pockets in a fan-like mostion, letting the cards fall where they may, never to be seen again.&nbsp; I also imagine that when that room gets full and all the other rooms in their home get full, they simply move, telling people that they just couldn't get business there.
<P>Notice the visual aspect of this explanation?&nbsp; Does it inspire you to do something differently?
<P>When you do contact your prospects or your Centers of Influence, don't try to sell them anything.&nbsp; People don't like to be "sold".&nbsp; Learn from them.&nbsp; Follow the advice of outstanding salespeople and ask questions.&nbsp; Get to know them.&nbsp; Let them get to know you.&nbsp; Have fun.
<P>After you've finished asking them all about them and how you might support them in your life or business, they will ask about you.&nbsp; They always do.&nbsp; Tell them your IDEAS<SUP>R</SUP>.&nbsp; Ask if they know anyone who worries.&nbsp; Share your umbrella.
