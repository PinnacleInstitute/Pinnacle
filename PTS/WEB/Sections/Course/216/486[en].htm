<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=3>&nbsp;Coe, Morceli, Gebrselassie. These are giants, familiar to every track coach and fan. They led middle and long distance running through frontiers that "experts" once assured us were impassable. But there are virtually unknown titans notching up even more unlikely accomplishments along the frontiers of current human achievement. To many, the most improbable thing about these events are how they are coming about. Great ideas and works are being created by specialists in one field crossing over into seemingly unrelated disciplines.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No area of science, technology or the arts has been immune to this cross-pollination. Examples are everywhere. A solid-state physicist, curious about the brain, sat in at a neuroscience seminar at M.I.T. The result was a revolutionary approach to neural nets and a giant step towards artificial intelligence. Literary scholars in England, trying to reconstruct the original version of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales were stymied. Then a biologist solved their problem using the computer program created to untangle the human genome.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even centuries old, and seemingly irrefutable, legal rules of evidence are falling before the sword of lawyers wielding complex new mathematical theories. Can we even trust our own senses anymore when we are con- fronted by comets, twisters, dinosaurs and dead presidents, all performing on cue? It's time we coaches take the hint and start doing a little more cross-pollination of our own.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B></B>When Alice encounters the Cheshire Cat in Wonderland and asks for directions, her situation is like that facing the athlete.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't much care where," said Alice.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So long as I get somewhere," Alice added as an explanation.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "If you only walk long enough."</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach any objective, the first requirement is to know what the objective is. The athlete who trains conscientiously will almost surely improve-that is-he or she will get somewhere. Great performances like a world record or Olympic championship, however, require a clearer and more precisely defined objective.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management is the skillful use of time, resource and materials to achieve a purpose, according to the Oxford Dictionary of English. Good management techniques increase the probability of achieving any objective or goal in any field of endeavor . Preparing athletes for the modern competitive arena has become, first and foremost, a management problem.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Management By Objectives" (MBO) is a business management theory first developed by Peter Drucker. An academic discussion of just about any subject is likely to drown the unbaptized in a sea of jargon. But reduce MBO to the bare essentials and it usually elicits a, "Well of course, everybody knows that. It's just common sense." MBO, like most great concepts, is a simple and elegant idea.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MBO theory rests in part on two premises. The first is that without a specific, quantifiable goal and time- table, you have no way to measure and evaluate progress. The second is that the process of establishing clear, concise and shared goals can itself often provide a road map to reach them. Incorporate these two simple but potent concepts into a plan covering every aspect of the athlete's performance and career and you have a problem solving approach that is just as useful to the coach as to the CEO. Add appropriate analytical methods from philosophy and engineering and you have a powerful tool for creating our next generation of record holders.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World records and Olympic champions are never accidental. They are the result of doing the right work in the right amount at the right time and seizing the opportunity when the right circumstances occur. But before the records, before the medals and anthems, even before the right work, there must be the right goal. Setting the right goal is the first step in every great achievement.</FONT>
