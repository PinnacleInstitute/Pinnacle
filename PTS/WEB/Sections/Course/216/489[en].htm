<BR>&nbsp;<FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT size=3>As a Division I NCAA track and field coach, Bill Bowerman had the task of managing not only the individual collegiate careers of his athletes but the fortunes of a team as well. Peter Coe, operating in a radically different competitive structure in Great Britain and Europe, had only the progress of a single runner to be concerned with.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet similarities abound in their approach to preparing athletes to run fast and to win. Both had a comprehensive approach to developing and managing the careers of the athletes in their charge. And both relied on the principle of selecting the appropriate goal as the basis of their annual and career training plans.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowerman presented a combination of curiosity, expertise, insight and just plain eccentric and unfettered thinking that few coaches have ever, or will ever achieve. The very uniqueness of the personality and mind of the man discourages many from any attempt to transplant his ideas. But a careful and thoughtful study of his work yields rich rewards. Listen to Bowerman and you got a late Mozart piano concerto. Hear a hundred performances and you' II still learn something new on the hundred and first. Continuing with the Mozart analogy, Coe's approach at first appears complex and intricate. It is, in fact, a marvelously simple and elegant solution to a complex problem. In short, another perfect example of Occam's Razor-the simplest answer is the best answer .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While every bit as forceful and charismatic a personality as Bowerman, Peter Coe devised a method with a cold logic about it that can at first seem intimidating to those of us who are "mathematically challenged."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of his solution, how- ever, is demonstrated by one simple fact. By the time Sebastian had reached 14, Peter was certain that he was very talented. By age 16, Peter felt a world record was in the cards and had established annual and career goals and fine-tuned a training and competition plan covering the period up to and including the 1980 Olympic Games. This plan proved to be so well conceived and flexible that it required only minimal adjustment over the next 17 years as Seb's career advanced inexorably toward world records and Olympic medals.</FONT>
