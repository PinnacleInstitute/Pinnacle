<BR>&nbsp;<FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT size=3>Few would dispute that Sebastian Coe is one of the greatest middle distance runners of all time. From his first step to his last, in a career spanning 21 years, he had one coach. That his coach was a rank novice with no coaching experience or related athletic or academic background what- ever surprised many. But, while Seb's coach (and father) Peter Coe may initially have been unencumbered with knowledge of sport and physiology, he was in fact superbly equipped to plan the training and career of the future multiple world record holder and Olympic champion. He was a practicing engineer and manager .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Peter Coe began seeking information to help 12-year Sebastian with his running, he became more and more perplexed. Advice received from one successful coach was, more often than not, at complete odds with that from other equally successful coaches. Peter's solution was to reinvent the wheel. Like any competent engineer, Peter started with a clean sheet of paper.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began by identifying the nature and scope of the problems of running very fast and winning. He asked fundamental questions. Then he applied the analytical and problem-solving techniques gained from a long and successful career as a professional engineer and production manager. In the end, he arrived at some rather startling conclusions. It seemed to Peter Coe that a lot of people were doing a lot of things wrong.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fortunate for the running world that he had the conviction of his beliefs. The career of his "product" showed what is possible when one is free of preconceived ideas about "the correct way to train" and what the "limits" of human performance are. In common with Bill Bowerman, Peter Coe applied innovative solutions to reach a horizon unimagined by his peers. By always aiming at the future, these two coaches stretched our vision of the possible.
