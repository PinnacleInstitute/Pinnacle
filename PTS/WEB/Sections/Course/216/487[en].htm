<BR></FONT></B>
<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><FONT size=3>The old adage, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" is sound advice-99% of the time. The catch is that in trying to reach the apex of athletic achievement, past success poses a present and subtle danger to those preparing the next generation of performers. This happens in two ways. First, there is the fact that the more successful a coach has been in the past, the greater the temptation to rely on exactly the same methods and workouts in the future. The result will eventually be marginal improvement at best and stagnation at worst. Secondly, training based solely on current methods and records tends to limit what we think is possible. Limit the mind, shrink the future. These are not optimal paths to new world records.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occam's Razor (William of Occam, 1285-1349) is a rule in philosophy and science that states that the simplest of two or more correct answers or theories is the preferred one and that the explanation of an unknown phenomenon should first be attempted in terms of what is already known. Most coaches base the pursuit of new levels of performance on existing methods and achievements rather than what is known about the nature of the performer and performing. This is a violation of Occam's Razor.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track and field athletes at the University of Oregon achieved a phenomenal record of success during Bill Bowerman's tenure as coach. Two-time Olympian Kenny Moore has said that "Bowerman was, and is and ever shall be a generous, ornery, profane, beatific, unyielding, antic, impenetrably complex Oregon original. (From the foreward of <B><I>High Performance Training for Track and Field</I></B>, by W. J. Bowerman and W. H. Freeman)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moore also observed that Bowerman was an inveterate tinkerer. Two of the foundation stones upon which the "Oregon System" was built were Bowerman's boundless curiosity and his goal-setting process. The basis of every athlete's training program was a rational and achievable short- and long-term goal. Coach and athlete worked together to establish these goals, a collaboration that resulted in a shared commitment to success.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bowerman has said that "the best goal is one that is challenging but just possible-with a little bit of luck." (To which we would add that Bowerman is a strong advocate of the idea that "the smarter you work, the luckier you get.")
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once appropriate goals were established, even his own tried and true training plans were subject to constant review and "experiments of one" to find the best training plan for each individual. Bill Bowerman ex- celled at guiding athletes towards appropriate and challenging goals and in applying the underlying principles responsible for success in simple, innovative ways. A perfect example of Occam's Razor. And by not simply repeating the past, Bowerman expanded the future.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Einstein stood on the shoulders of Newton and Newton upon the shoulders of earlier giants, we coaches also stand upon the work of our predecessors. It is, after all, the "crazy" new ideas that worked that have established the basic principles of training that we rely on today.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet many of us, when preparing training plans, make the fundamental error of mistaking method for principle. While many training methods can rightly be dismissed as obsolete or mere fashion, we ignore, at our athlete's cost, the principles underlying the successes of the great innovators.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As each new world record holder or Olympic champion arrives on the scene, there is the inevitable rush to duplicate the workouts or diet or whatever it is that is perceived to be the secret of the new top gun. We forget to ask the "why" questions. And in our haste to adopt the "new technology," we even neglect to ex- tract and apply essential principles from the "old." It seems that once an athlete no longer holds the record or is the current champion, the foundations his or her success rested upon are quickly forgotten. To quote a very pretty woman, Julia Roberts, "Big mistake. Big. Huge!"
