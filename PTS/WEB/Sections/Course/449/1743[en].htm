This class is the foundation for all the other classes in this program.&nbsp; You'll understand what Contrarian job hunting is all about and why you may find yourself resisting some of the concepts in the program.
<P>Essentially, we will take all your assumptions about the way you're "supposed to" find a job, and throw them out the window.&nbsp; In their place, you'll begin to learn the secrets of professional salespeople who know how to reach decision makers, get the meeting and come away with a "yes!"
