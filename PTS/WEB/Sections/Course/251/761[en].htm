<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Setting Top Values in a Query</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>You can limit the results of a query so that only the highest or lowest values for a field appear in a RecordSet. For example, you can set the top values of a <B>Quantity Sold</B> field to 10 to find the top ten best selling products. You can limit the number of records to a specific number or a percentage of all records being queried (i.e. top 25%). The field for which you are setting the top or bottom values must be sorted. If the field is sorted in descending order (Z to A, 9 to 0), the top values will be found. If the field is sorted in ascending order (A to Z, 0 to 9), the bottom values will be found.

<P><FONT size=3>You may want to use field values in a table to calculate new values, such as multiplying the value in the <B>Participants</B> field by the value in the <B>Cost</B> field to calculate the total cost. Access allows you to use expressions to calculate new field values. The expression can also include a single field, which has a value that needs to be adjusted, such as doubling a <B>Cost</B> field to calculate values for a price increase. In expressions, field names are enclosed in square brackets ([ ]); numbers are not. For example, to calculate a double in the amount of a course cost and display the results in a column you want to name <B>Tuition</B> <B>Increase</B> , you would enter <B>Tuition Increase:2*[Cost]</B> in the design grid. The colon is used to separate the column name from the expression. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You create calculated fields in queries. You can also use criteria to remove nonessential records, thereby allowing the query to run faster. The results can then be used to generate a report.

</OL><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Creating a Concatenation in a Query</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>Access allows you to combine two or more fields into one field. This process, known as concatenation, enables you to add field name text strings to one another. The text strings can follow each other with or without spaces. You can add other characters between the text strings if needed. For example, you can combine the individual <B>City</B> , <B>State</B> , and <B>Postal</B> <B>Code</B> fields into one field called <B>Address</B> . You can have the comma and space characters appear between the field text strings. This concatenation process can be performed by creating a query to combine two or more fields. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When typing expressions for concatenation, the first part of the expression defines the name of the new field. The second part of the expression defines the fields which are to be concatenated. These field names must be surrounded by brackets. The ampersand (&amp;) appears between the field name brackets. Any additional characters that are to appear between the fields are surrounded by double quotes.&nbsp; For example, the expression <B>Names: [First Name] &amp;" - "&amp;[Last Name]</B> creates a new field called <B>Names</B> . The new field contains the first name and last name separated by a space, a hyphen, and a space.

<P><FONT size=3>There may be instances when you need to add more than one table or query to a query. In order to do this, you need to ensure that the field lists are joined to each other with a join line so that Access knows how to connect the information. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>If tables in a query are not joined to one another, Access does not know which records are associated with which, so every combination of records between the two tables would appear in the query. Therefore, if each table had 50 records, the query's results would contain 2500 records (50x50), thereby rendering useless results. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>If you previously </FONT><FONT color=#000000 size=3>created a relationship</FONT><FONT size=3> between tables in the Relationship window, Access automatically displays join lines when you add related tables in query <B>Design</B> view. If you have not previously created relationships, Access automatically creates joins if tables were added to a query as long as the tables each have a field with the same or compatible data type and one of the join fields is a primary key. If tables added to the query do not include any fields that can be joined, you have to add one or more extra tables or queries to serve solely as a bridge between the tables containing the data you want to use.</FONT><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Filtering a Query</FONT></H4>
