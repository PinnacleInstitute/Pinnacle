<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Using the Crosstab Query Wizard</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>You can use crosstab queries to group and summarize information and display it in a spreadsheet format. Crosstab queries create less repetition of information in the datasheet, making it easier to read and analyze the selected field data. The Crosstab Query Wizard can help you quickly create a crosstab query. Through a step by step process, the Crosstab Query Wizard asks you for information about the tables and fields you want in your query. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You need three fields to create a crosstab query. The first field displays its values as row headings for the datasheet, the second field displays its values as column headings for the datasheet. The third field is the field on which the calculation is performed. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>For example, crosstab queries can provide information as to how many of each product (listed as row headings) are sold by each sales representative (listed as column headings). At the intersection of each row and column is the amount of each product sold by each sales representative.

<P><FONT size=3>The Find Duplicates Query Wizard assists you in designing a query that displays duplicate records in tables. This query can be used to group records with like field values, such as finding all customers in a particular city. More importantly, there may be identical records stored in a table when only one record is necessary. The Find Duplicates Query Wizard displays these duplicate records. The unnecessary duplicate records can then be deleted from the table.

</OL><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Using the Find Unmatched Query Wizard</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>You can manage related data in tables using the Find Unmatched Query Wizard. This wizard assists you in designing a query that finds records that are "orphans," meaning that there are no records in a related table to which they correspond. For example, suppose you delete records from a Customers table containing the names of customers who have not placed any orders for more than one year. Two years later, an old customer places an order, which is entered into the Orders table. Because these tables are likely to be related, having an order without any customer information (such as the mailing address) is likely to cause problems. You can use the Find Unmatched Query Wizard to display these records and correct the problem by updating the Customers table.
