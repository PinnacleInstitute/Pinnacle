<H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Sorting a Query</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>When you run a query, the records in the RecordSet appear in the same order in which they appear in the table. You can sort the records by either sorting the RecordSet or assigning a sort order in the query design. You can sort the RecordSet just as you would sort a table. However, you must do this every time you run the query. If you assign the sort order in the query design, Access performs the sort automatically each time you run the query.

<P><FONT size=3>To select records that meet a single value, you enter the value in the <B>Criteria</B> row under the appropriate field. Access automatically inserts quotation marks (" ") around alphanumeric entries and number symbols (#) around date entries. If the entry is numeric, the number appears without quotation marks. When you run the query, only those records with values that match the criteria appear in the RecordSet.

</OL><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Hiding a Field in a Query</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>You can use a field to select records that meet a certain criteria without displaying the field in the RecordSet. This option is useful when all the records meet the same specified criteria and, therefore, you do not need the field to appear. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>For example, you may want to create a query to display customers in the <B>Southeast</B> region. Therefore, you must add the <B>Region</B> field to the query in order to enter the criteria to select only the <B>Southeast</B> region. However, you might not want the field to appear in the RecordSet because you know that all the data in the <B>Region</B> field is the same (<B> Southeast</B> ). In this case, you may want to hide the field you used for the criteria. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The design grid includes a <B>Show</B> row with a check box for each field. If the check box is selected, the field will appear in the RecordSet. If the check box is deselected, the field will be hidden in the RecordSet. All the <B>Show</B> field check boxes are selected by default. </FONT>

</OL><H4 align=center><FONT size=4>Adding a Record Using a Query</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT size=3>You can use a query to update records in related tables. When you enter information into the join field for a primary table, Access automatically locates the corresponding information in the related table and enters it into the record. For example, the <B>Orders</B> and <B>Customers</B> tables are related. When you enter the customer ID number in the appropriate field in the <B>Orders</B> table, Access completes the customer name and address information automatically through the relationship with the <B>Customers</B> table. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can always edit information in queries based on a single table. In queries based on related tables, Access must be able to determine the relationship type (i.e., one-to-one or one-to-many), or you cannot edit information. In queries with tables that have a one-to-one relationship, you can always edit data. In queries with tables that have a one-to-many relationship, you may not be able to edit data at times. For example, this can happen if the join field from the "many" table is not in the query, since Access cannot create new records in the "many" table. For example, Access cannot create new orders for a customer if the query is based on the <B>Customers</B> table unless the <B>Customer ID</B> field from the <B>Orders</B> table is included in the query.
