Hello there!&nbsp; Thanks for choosing this course for learning the basic points of the English language.&nbsp; Whether you learn English as a foreign language, study it at school or would just like more of a rounder understanding of it, this is the course&nbsp;that can help&nbsp;you!
<P>Firstly, I'd like to explain why I decided to compile these courses before I move onto course content.&nbsp; As a novelist, proof-reader, editor and journalist, I have read a lot of stuff.&nbsp; A LOT.&nbsp; That's the good news.&nbsp; The bad news is that most of what I've read has appalled me.&nbsp; Particularly the most recent literary advances.&nbsp; Now, don't get me wrong - I have nothing against contemporary literature.&nbsp; In fact, I am all for it!&nbsp; What I am against is ignorant people who do not have a clue about Standard English, and attempt to massacre this beautiful language by using their own non-standard (and in my, perhaps out-dated, opinion, downright WRONG) version.&nbsp; This is probably due to the lack of good teaching methods from their schools, as in one of my A Level classes a few&nbsp;months ago, one kid politely asked the teacher, "Miss, is <B> rainbow</B>  a verb?"&nbsp; The worst thing about this is that he was not pretending to be stupid.&nbsp; He actually didn't know.&nbsp; This was in a class of aspiring doctors and law students, hoping to achieve As at the end of their exams. &nbsp;I felt like smashing my head against the table.
<P>So,&nbsp;because of&nbsp;this, the course you are now reading the introduction of was born!
<P>Because I am still fairly young, I think it is important for me to&nbsp;impart my knowledge as best I can to help those who need it most.&nbsp; That's you guys.&nbsp; :)
<P>Enjoy!
