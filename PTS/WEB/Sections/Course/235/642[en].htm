<FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Anxiety is a common feeling usually involving worry about the future. It can range from a vague feeling of uneasiness and discomfort to intense feeling or terror and impending doom. Anxiety produces an increase in various physiological and mental processes. That increase can motivate us to more thoroughly prepare for performance situations like examinations and athletic competition, but it can also become so intense that it interferes with our ability to function normally in every day activities. Such is the case when we become overly anxious during an examination and cannot recall a concept we thoroughly studied the previous evening. Constant anxiety may signal an anxiety disorder. </FONT><H2><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#993300><A name=1></A></FONT><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3><B>Common Questions About Anxiety</B></FONT><B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></FONT></B><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

<BR></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Fear usually involves uneasiness and apprehension directed toward some concrete, external object or situation. Also, fear is associated with events or situations that could happen. Anxiety, on the other hand, is more of a subjective state of uneasiness and apprehension in response to a vague and sometimes unrecognized danger. With anxiety, we cannot always specify what it is we are anxious about. Often, anxiety tends to be out of proportion and unrealistic.

<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3><B>Is there any value in worrying?</B>
<BR></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>We sometimes feel worrying about something helps us better prepare for dealing with it. What usually happens however, is that worrying increases our anxiety which in turn can interfere with daily functions like thinking clearly and making decisions. Planning, doing what we can and then placing thing in the hands of the Lord is a better way to prepare and deal with difficult or scary situations.

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Everyone experiences anxiety at different times during the day or week. Most of the time those feelings appear and leave rather quickly.

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><FONT size=3>Anxiety can occasionally motivate us to take action on something we have been neglecting, postponing, or have little interest in.
