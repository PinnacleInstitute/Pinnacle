<H2>Group Health Insurance</H2>
<P>Group health insurance coverage through an employer or other group also has both advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include part or all of the premium being paid by the employer or other policy holder. Group policies are usually less expensive than individual policies. Usually everyone is eligible for coverage regardless of health. Group health insurance coverage is typically comprehensive, and premiums can be deducted from paychecks if the policy holder is the employer. Coverage generally cannot be cut off because of the number of claims someone has. With most group health insurance policies, you can select your own health care providers.
<P>Disadvantages of group health insurance policies include losing coverage when you no longer belong to the group. However, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 requires a continuation privilege meaning that you can keep group insurance coverage by paying the premium yourself if you leave the group for a specified time period. Widows with dependent children, and divorced or separated spouses and dependent children, and divorced or separated spouses and dependent children may do so for three years. Retired people, their spouses and dependent children may do so for 18 months as can unemployed and reduced-hour employees and their dependent children.
<P>Other disadvantages of group health insurance include not being able to tailor the policy to individual needs. Group policies usually require that claims must be filed and may have high deductibles. Generally preventive care is not covered. Low limits for major medical, mental health, and/or chemical dependency treatment may also be part of group health policies.
