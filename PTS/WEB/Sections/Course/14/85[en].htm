<LI><B>Font</B> - Select a simple, common font for the web page. Keep in mind that the list that appears in FrontPage is the list of fonts loaded onto <I>your</I> computer while many of the visitors of your web site will not have the same fonts. Choose a font such as Arial, Geneva, Verdana, Helvetica, or another sans-serif font that is easy to read and most people have loaded on their computers. 
<LI><B>Font Style</B> - Select bold, italics, or a combination of both. 
<LI><B>Size</B> - Font sizes on web pages are designated by different values than the point sizes you may be used to working with in Word and other word processing programs. Font sizes are listed in parentheses next to the HTML point sizes. A point size of 2 or 3 is usually best for paragraph text. Below are examples of the font sizes using Arial font. 
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=1>font size 1</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=2>font size 2</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>font size 3</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=4>font size 4</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=5>font size 5 
<BR>
<BR></FONT>
<LI><B>Effects</B> - Many of these effects are unnecessary and some are not viewable on all browsers. It is not recommended that you <I><B>underline</B></I> any text as this will confuse your user since links are usually underlined. Use bold and italics to emphasize text instead of underlining. <B><I>Blink</I></B> is an old HTML specification and since it is quite annoying, many browsers no longer support it. <I><B>Strong</B></I> and <I><B>Emphasis</B></I> produce similar results to bold and italics. 
<LI>Press <B>OK</B> when finished.

<P><B> Headings</B>
<P>Explain these. They generally don't work properly in Netscape, but do work when assigned values in themes.
<P><B> Converting Text to Tables</B>
<P>The text below was typed into FrontPage by pressing the <B>TAB</B> key after each number and <B>ENTER</B> to begin each new line.
