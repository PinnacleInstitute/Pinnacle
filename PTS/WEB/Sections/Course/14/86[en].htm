<P><B> Creating Links</B>
<P>Hyperlinks are text or graphics that can be clicked to bring the user to another web file such as a web page or graphic. They are the essence of the World Wide Web as they link pages within sites and web sites to other web sites. To create a hyperlink in FrontPage, follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Highlight the text or graphic that will be the hyperlink and select <B>Insert|Hyperlink</B> from the menu bar or pressing <B>CTRL+K</B>.
<BR><IMG height=350 alt="[Create Hyperlink dialog box]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/createhyperlink.gif" width=500 vspace=5 border=1> 
<LI>If the link will lead to a page within your site, highlight the page on the list and click <B>OK</B>. If it is an external link that will lead to another web site, enter the URL in the <B>URL box</B>. External URLs MUST begin with "http://" or they will not work. For example, to link to the FGCU home page, type "http://www.fgcu.edu/" instead of "www.fgcu.edu/".
<BR>
</OL>
<P><B> E-mail Links</B>
<P>Create an e-mail address link by highlighting the text (which should be written as the e-mail address) and pressing <B>CTRL+K</B>. Click the e-mail button with the envelope icon (circled in red below) and enter the e-mail address in the box provided. Click <B>OK</B> on both windows to finish.

<P><B> Bookmarks</B>
<P>Text and graphics can be set as bookmarks (called "anchors" everywhere except FrontPage) that can be linked to within a page. For example, if a page lists a course syllabus, the titles for each week can be set as bookmarks and a row of links can be added to the top of the page that will each skip down to those bookmarked sections. This method of using bookmarks allows visitors to your site to quickly access information by not having to scroll down the page to view the information they want.<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Add a bookmark to a page</B> by following these steps highlighting the text or graphic that will be the bookmark and select <B>Insert|Bookmark...</B> from the menu bar. Enter the bookmark name in the space provided and click <B>OK</B>. 
<P><IMG height=282 alt="[Bookmark dialog box]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/bookmark.gif" width=284 border=1>
<P><B>Create a link to a bookmark</B> by highlighting the text that will be the link and pressing <B>CTRL+K</B>. Select the bookmark from the drop-down menu in the <B>Optional</B> category and click <B>OK</B>. Link to a bookmark on a separate page by first selecting the file name from the listing and then choosing from the bookmarks in the drop-down menu.

<P><B> Hotspots</B>
<P>By making a graphic a link in the ways that have already been discussed, each graphic can only link to one location. However, you may have a single graphic that has several sections that each need to link to different pages. Hotspots allow you do to this by creating an image map over the graphic. The main header on the FGCU homepage will be used as an example:
<P><IMG height=57 alt=[graphic] src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/hotspot1.gif" width=590>
<P>The FGCU logo, "Search", "Directory", and "Index" images all link to different pages on this single graphic. Hotspots can be created by following these steps:
<OL>
<LI>Insert the graphic onto the webpage. 
<LI>Using the hotspot tools on the <B>Drawing</B> toolbar, use the necessary shapes to draw the hotspots on the graphic.
<BR><IMG height=27 alt="[Drawing toolbar section]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/hotspottools.gif" width=120 vspace=10 border=1> 
<BR>The rectangle tool will be used first to draw the hotspot around "search". 
<BR><IMG height=60 alt=[graphic] src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/hotspot2.gif" width=592>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The hyperlink window will appear when the mouse button is released. Enter the URL, e-mail address, or bookmark the hotspot will link to. 
<LI>Repeat steps 2-3 until all the hotspots have been added. Use the handles on the hotspots to resize them. 
<BR><IMG height=60 alt=[graphic] src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/frontpage/images/hotspot3.gif" width=592>
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If the remainder of the graphic (any part not covered by a hotspot such as the green to blue gradient in the center of this graphic) should be another link, right-click on any area of the graphic that is not a hotspot, select <B>Picture Properties</B> and enter the <B>Default hyperlink</B> location.
