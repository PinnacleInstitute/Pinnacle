<LI>Use contrasting colors for the text and the background so the text will be easy to read.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Use font size large enough to be seen from the back of the room where the presentation will be held. A font size of 24-point or larger is recommended.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Use short phrases and sentences to convey your message.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Use simple slide transitions. Too many different transitions will distract your audience from the subject of the presentation.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Avoid cluttering the slides with too much text or graphics. Your audience should hear what you have to say and not be distracted by a busy screen.
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Keep text simple and easy to read by not using many different text effects such as <B>bold</B>, <I>italics</I>, <U>underlining</U>, <FONT size=+2>larger font size</FONT> for emphasis within a sentence, or a <FONT face="Courier New, Courier, mono">different font</FONT> all on the same slide.
