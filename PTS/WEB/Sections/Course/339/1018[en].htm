<BR><FONT size=3><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to <B>The Affiliate Masters Course, </B>a comprehensive, <B>do</B>-able <B>10-DAY</B> 
<BR>program of building <B>income through content.</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>You will emerge from this <B>10-DAY </B>program with a radically stronger information 
<BR>base and skill set - well on your way towards building a substantial affiliate 
<BR>business. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Each of the <B>10 DAYS </B>has a specific <B>“Goal-of-the-DAY,” </B>a clear, <B>do</B>-able, target. 
<BR>Complete this goal before moving ahead to the next <B>DAY</B>. By the time you finish 
<BR><B>DAY 10’s Goal-of-the-DAY, </B>you will have a <B>Theme-Based Content Site </B>up 
<BR>and running and generating traffic and income. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Each <B>DAY </B>also sets an <B>“Ongoing Goal.” </B>Why? <B>Because a Web site is never</B> 
<BR><B>“finished.” </B>The <B>Ongoing Goal </B>is what you should be achieving on a regular 
<BR>basis. The <B>Ongoing Goals </B>provide the pathway for building <B>maximal income</B> 
<BR>through content over the following weeks and months. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Bottom line?... 
<BR>Upon completion of the course, an income-generating process will be clearly 
<BR>established. <B>Call it your </B><B>10-DAY </B><B>program to </B><B>building income through</B> 
<BR><B>content!</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff size=4> 
<P align=left><B>(SIDEBAR!)</B></FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT color=#0033ff>The Affiliate Masters Course is a <B>“work-at-your-own-pace” </B>course. Some of 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>you will be able to devote <B>large blocks of time </B>to it. So you’ll complete a <B>“DAY”</B> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>in one (or even less) of <B>your </B>days. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>Others may only have 15-30 minutes per day to spend on it. So it could take you 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>a week or more to complete a <B>“DAY” </B>of the course. 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>Either way, it does <B>not </B>matter how <B>long </B>it takes you to complete the course. Set 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>aside a certain amount of time per day to attend this course and to do your 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>homework. You’ll find it was time well, no <B>best, </B>spent.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color=#000000> 
<BR><B>The Affiliate Masters Course </B>is designed and written for all affiliates. Just 
<BR>beginning to develop a second income stream? Or are you an established 
<BR>affiliate of several programs? Doesn’t matter... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>Everyone </B>shares the same goal... <B>to maximize profits. </B>Be forewarned about 
<BR>the <B>Affiliate Masters, </B>though... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The material that we will be covering will be extensive in scope. It will require 
<BR><B>effort and commitment </B>on your part, as does anything important that yields 
<BR>rewards. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Most folks have to train or go to university for years to prepare to earn a 
<BR>substantial income stream. Your mini-university course will accomplish this by 
<BR>the end of this e-book. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Don’t let me scare you, though... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>All </B>of it is manageable. Take your time to digest the information properly before 
<BR>you start to work on the prescribed action steps towards your goals. Use the 
<BR><B>Goals-of-the-DAY </B>and <B>Ongoing Goals </B>- make them your <B>guide-posts, </B>your 
<BR>beacons of light. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Understanding the concepts will boost your confidence level in applying them. 
<BR>Even as adults, we never lose our need to know “why” things work the way they 
<BR>do. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>It’s critical that you finish each <B>DAY </B>of this course before you begin the next. 
<BR>The <B>DAYS </B>build on each other. You are following a <B>step-by-step process.</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>As I said, though, please don’t feel that you have to rush - <B>work at your own</B> 
<BR><B>pace, </B>as time allows. Set your own work schedule... and stick to it. Take as 
<BR>much time as you need to complete the <B>10-DAY </B>program. Set a <B>realistic</B> 
<BR>schedule that will allow you to do your best. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Do you only have 30 minutes daily to work on the course? No problem. Your 
<BR><B>Affiliate Master’s “DAY” </B>is done when it’s done, even if it takes you a week! 
<BR><B>This is not a race.</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Final piece of advice... Use your printer to make a <B>hard copy </B>(your own 
<BR>textbook!). There is just too much information in the <B>Affiliate Masters Course </B>to 
<BR>learn by reading off a monitor screen. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>Underline the important parts. </B>Add your own notes and ideas. I promise you... 
<BR>you’ll get lots and lots of great inspiration as you go along. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>Please</B>... work with a printed version of this course. If you are at all serious 
<BR>about following this course to build a serious income stream, <B>please start right...</B> 
<BR><B>print it.</B>
