<P align=left><FONT size=3>If you feel that your anger is really out of control, if it is having an impact on your relationships and on important parts of your life, consider counseling to learn how to handle it better. A mental health professional can work with you in developing a range of techniques for changing your thinking and your behavior. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>When you talk to a prospective therapist, say that you have problems with anger that you want to work on, and ask about his or her approach to anger management. Make sure the approach is more than just "putting you in touch with your feelings and expressing them" -- that may be precisely what your problem is. With counseling, a highly angry person can move closer to a middle range of anger in about 8 to 10 weeks, depending on the circumstances and the techniques used. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Remember, you can't eliminate anger -- and it wouldn't be a good idea if you could. In spite of all your efforts, things happen that will cause you anger, and sometimes they will be justifiable. Life has its frustration, pain, loss, and unpredictable actions of others. You can't change that. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>But you can change the way you let such events affect you. Controlling your angry responses can keep them from making you even more unhappy in the long run.</FONT>
