<P align=left><FONT size=3>As soon as you start to feel angry, stop and ask yourself the following questions as a final "reality check" before it's too late. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>In fact, we recommend that you memorize these questions. The very instant you feel the heat of anger coming upon you, immediately start to work your way through these five questions. By the time you're finished, you may find yourself in a much healthier psychological state. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>1. Where is the evidence?</B></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Is there sufficient evidence to back up the interpretation you have made of the event that is angering you? </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Scenario example: Someone is late for dinner and you say to yourself, "That selfish bastard doesn't care that I have made dinner." Where is the evidence? Is this person really a selfish bastard? Does the person have qualities that don't support this interpretation? </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>2. Is there another way of looking at this event?</B></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Try to entertain one or two other explanations for what you've interpreted as "deliberate provocation." After all, there are two sides to every coin. Often this is enough to at least decrease anger to the level of mild frustration. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Scenario continued:. Could there be a reasonable explanation for lateness. Is there traffic? Could something have come up, which will become known when he arrives? Have I sufficiently told him that being on time is very important to me and to please call if late? </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>3. So what?</B></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Rarely are things as catastrophic in reality as they seem in the heat of the moment. So the driver in the SUV cut you off. So what! Will it amount to anything three hours from now? Has your dignity as a driver really been damaged? </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Scenario continued: So what if he's late. Let's say he's 20 minutes late. Is it worth ruining the whole evening by assaulting him right when he comes in? Is it likely that it will be forgotten about after 10 minutes of chatting? </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>4. What will the outcome be?</B></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Thinking of potential outcomes of our actions is not easy, much less when you are in a state of anger. Anger is by nature "single minded." Extreme anger almost always has negative outcomes when it is taken out on another person. Even though you're in the heat of the moment, see if you can train yourself to step into the future and think of the potential outcome. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Scenario continued: Could your anger end up ruining the evening? What if you do verbally assault him for being late? What could happen? Could it put a damper on the evening? How would you respond if you had a legitimate reason for being late and were nonetheless attacked? Would you want to turn around and drive home? </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>5. Where is the other person coming from?</B></FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Anger creates cognitive myopia. You can't see the whole picture. When you get angry, you narrow your focus on what you perceive as an injustice. So it's harder to empathize with others when you're angry. Force yourself to empathize EARLY ON, before anger is out of control. Imagine yourself in the other person's shoes. "What would I be thinking if she was coming across like I am right now?" Even a momentary consideration of the validity of the other person's feelings can be enough to soften your anger to the extent that it is manageable. </FONT>
<P align=left><B><U><FONT size=3>Summary</FONT></B></U><FONT size=3>: Anger is one of the most difficult emotions to control, because it has a sudden onset and escalates quickly. The key to effective anger management is to slow things down. Once you have learned to recognize early arousal signs, and how to step back and evaluate the situation thoroughly, anger loses much of its power.
