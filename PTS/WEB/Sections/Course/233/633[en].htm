<P align=left><FONT size=3>Anger causes a constriction of your awareness. You to become "single-minded" in the following ways: </FONT>

<P align=left><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><U>An increased focus on your needs or wants</U>: As you become angry, the pain and needs of others becomes increasingly unimportant. All that matters is your pain and what you want. </FONT>
<P align=left>
<LI><FONT size=3><U>A greater sense of confidence</U>: The angrier you are, the more you believe you can do whatever is necessary to eliminate the perceived threat or to meet your needs. </FONT>
<P align=left>
<LI><FONT size=3><U>A sense of righteousness</U>: Anger produces a sense that what you are doing is morally justified. </FONT>

<P align=left><H3><CENTER><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Causes "Thinking Errors"</FONT></CENTER></H3>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Many researchers have discovered that anger control problems tend to be associated with a number of "thinking errors". </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>1. Cognitive Deficits</B>: People with anger control problems have an insufficient number of adaptive responses to provoking events. Research has shown that angry people, when asked how they would solve provocative situations, have fewer ideas than people without anger problems. These few ideas, not surprisingly, tend to be hostile. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>2. Frequent False Positives</B>: People with anger control problems often misconstrue events such that they feel provoked even when they are not. It has been found that people with anger control problems tend to be vigilant for people may be deliberately hassling them. Therefore, due to only seeing part of the picture, they tend to frequently misconstrue innocuous actions. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>3. Rigid Beliefs</B>: People with anger control problems often possess steadfast beliefs as to the legitimacy of hostile retaliation. Some examples include: · "Hostility is okay if someone does something to provoke it." · "The best way to get your needs met is to demand it." · "People are, for the most part, stupid and need to be dealt with forcefully." It's not difficult to imagine how adhering to such beliefs might lead to some volatile encounters. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3><B>4. Difficulty Anticipating Outcomes Before Action</B>: People without anger problems are able to control how they respond to anger and actually keep it from getting out of control by predicting what "could" happen if they "lost it." People with anger problems tend to respond quickly without such forethought. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Learn how to step back in an angry situation and evaluate accurately. Anger has a swift onset. The best way to control angry escalation is to nip it in the bud before it gets out of control. This requires learning how to alert yourself to the subtle signs of increasing anger. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>In the heat of an angry moment, try to see if you can understand where the alleged perpetrator is coming from. Empathy is very difficult when angry, but it can make all the difference in the world. Isn't it frequently the case that when we get intensely angry at someone, the next day we feel guilty to some degree? We may say to ourselves something like, "You know, they did have a point. I sort of over-reacted." Taking the other person's point of view can be excruciating when in the throes of anger, but with practice it can become second nature. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>When angry, try to listen carefully to what is being said to you. Anger creates a hostility filter, and often all you can hear is negatively toned.</FONT>
