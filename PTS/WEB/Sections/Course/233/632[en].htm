<P align=left><FONT size=3>We all know what anger is, and we've all felt it, whether as a fleeting annoyance or as full-fledged rage. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>It's is a completely normal, usually healthy, human emotion. But when it gets out of control and turns destructive, it can lead to problems - at work, in your personal relationships, and in the overall quality of your life. And it can make you feel as though you're at the mercy of an unpredictable and powerful emotion. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Anger is defined as "an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage". Like other emotions, it's accompanied by physiological and biological changes. When you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your stress response hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You could be angry at a specific person (Such as a coworker or supervisor) or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight), or your anger could be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems. Memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry feelings. </FONT>
<P align=left><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Expressing Your Anger</A></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond aggressively. It's is a natural, adaptive response to threats; it inspires powerful, often aggressive feelings and behaviors, which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked. A certain amount of anger, therefore, is necessary to our survival. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>However, a common problem is that you may exaggerate the provocation in situations (especially interpersonal ones), in such a way that you feel intense and prolonged anger. This unnecessary response often leads to an exaggerated expression of anger, usually towards others. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>On the other hand, you may find it very hard to express your anger. You may have internal rules and standards that mandate that anger "must not be openly expressed". This sort of self-discipline can lead to problems, because anger that is not expressed tends to "stockpile". Unexpressed anger keeps you aroused physiologically, which can lead to serious health problems. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Therefore, it's important to identify your anger, identify what beliefs are keeping you from expressing it, and find appropriate channels for its expression.

<P align=left><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>The 3 Basic Ways We Deal with Anger</A></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>People use both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches to anger are expressing, suppressing, and calming. </FONT>
<UL>
<P align=left><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Expressing</B>. Expressing your angry feelings in an assertive, non-aggressive manner is the healthiest way to express anger. To do this, you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are, and how to get them met, without hurting others. Being assertive doesn't mean being pushy or demanding; it means being respectful of yourself and others. </FONT>
<P align=left>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Suppressing</B>. Anger can be suppressed, and then converted or redirected. This happens when you hold in your anger, stop thinking about it, and focus on something positive. The aim is to inhibit or suppress your anger and convert it into more constructive behavior. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>The danger in this type of response is that if it isn't allowed outward expression, your anger can turn inward - on yourself. Unexpressed anger can create a number of problems: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>Pathological expressions of anger, such as passive-aggressive behavior (getting back at people indirectly, without telling them why, rather than confronting them head-on) </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>A personality that seems perpetually cynical and hostile. People who are constantly putting others down, criticizing everything, and making cynical comments haven't learned how to constructively express their anger. Not surprisingly, they aren't likely to have many successful relationships. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Chronic health problems such as hypertension, heart disease, hormonal imbalances, headaches, indigestion, insomnia, skin problems, stroke, and anxiety. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Feelings of helplessness, which can lead to depression.</FONT>
</UL>
<P align=left><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Calming</B>. You can calm down inside. This means not just controlling your outward behavior, but also controlling your internal responses, taking steps to lower your heart rate, calming yourself down, and letting the feelings subside. </FONT>
</UL>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>When none of these three techniques work, that's when someone - or something - is going to get hurt.</FONT>

<P align=left><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management</A></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>These are the consequences of mismanaging your anger: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>Prevents you from dealing with the source of the problem. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Keeps you from correcting distortions in your thinking. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Keeps you helpless by stopping problem-solving. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Keeps you from processing and releasing painful emotions. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Sours relationships. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Increases the overall pain you experience.</FONT>
</UL>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>The goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>You can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage you, nor can you change them, but you can learn to control your reactions.</FONT>
