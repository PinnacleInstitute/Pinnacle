<BR><U>Relax</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Simple relaxation tools, such as deep breathing and relaxing imagery, can help calm down angry feelings. There are books and courses that can teach you relaxation techniques, and once you learn the techniques, you can call upon them in any situation. If you are involved in a relationship where both partners are hot-tempered, it might be a good idea for both of you to learn these techniques. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Some simple steps you can try: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3>Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm; breathing from your chest won't relax you. Picture your breath coming up from your "gut." </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as "relax," "take it easy." Repeat it to yourself while breathing deeply. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Use imagery; visualize a relaxing experience, from either your memory or your imagination. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3>Non-strenuous, slow yoga-like exercises can relax your muscles and make you feel much calmer. </FONT>
</UL>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Practice these anger management techniques daily. Learn to use them automatically when you're in a tense situation.</FONT>

<BR><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management Techniques #2: 
<BR><U>Change the Way You Think</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Simply put, this means changing the way you think. Angry people tend to curse, swear, or speak in highly colorful terms that reflect their inner thoughts. When you're angry, your thinking can get very exaggerated and overly dramatic. Try replacing these thoughts with more rational ones. For instance, instead of telling yourself, "oh, it's awful, it's terrible, everything's ruined," tell yourself, "it's frustrating, and it's understandable that I'm upset about it, but it's not the end of the world and getting angry is not going to fix it anyhow." </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Be careful of words like "never" or "always" when talking about yourself or someone else. "This !&amp;*%@ machine never works," or "you're always forgetting things" are not just inaccurate, they also serve to make you feel that your anger is justified and that there's no way to solve the problem. They also alienate and humiliate people who might otherwise be willing to work with you on a solution. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Remind yourself that getting angry is not going to fix anything, that it won't make you feel better (and may actually make you feel worse). </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it's justified, can quickly become irrational. So use cold hard logic on yourself. Remind yourself that the world is "not out to get you," you're just experiencing some of the rough spots of daily life. Do this each time you feel anger getting the best of you, and it'll help you get a more balanced perspective. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Angry people tend to demand things: fairness, appreciation, agreement, willingness to do things their way. Everyone wants these things, and we are all hurt and disappointed when we don't get them, but angry people demand them, and when their demands aren't met, their disappointment becomes anger. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>As part of their cognitive restructuring, angry people need to become aware of their demanding nature and translate their expectations into desires. In other words, saying, "I would like" something is healthier than saying, "I demand" or "I must have" something. When you're unable to get what you want, you will experience the normal reactions—frustration, disappointment, hurt—but not anger. Some angry people use this anger as a way to avoid feeling hurt, but that doesn't mean the hurt goes away.</FONT>

<BR><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management Techniques #3: 
<BR><U>Approach Problems Differently</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Sometimes, our anger and frustration are caused by very real and inescapable problems in our lives. Not all anger is misplaced, and often it's a healthy, natural response to these difficulties. There is also a cultural belief that every problem has a solution, and it adds to our frustration to find out that this isn't always the case. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>The best attitude to bring to such a situation, then, is not to focus on finding the solution, but rather on how you handle and face the problem. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Make a plan, and check your progress along the way. Resolve to give it your best, but also not to punish yourself if an answer doesn't come right away. If you can approach it with your best intentions and efforts and make a serious attempt to face it head-on, you will be less likely to lose patience and fall into all-or-nothing thinking, even if the problem does not get solved right away.

<BR><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management Techniques #4: 
<BR><U>Improve Communication</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Angry people tend to jump to -- and act on -- conclusions, and some of those conclusions can be very inaccurate. The first thing to do if you're in a heated discussion is slow down and think through your responses. Don't say the first thing that comes into your head, but slow down and think carefully about what you want to say. At the same time, listen carefully to what the other person is saying and take your time before answering. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Listen, too, to what is underlying the anger. For instance, suppose you like a certain amount of freedom and personal space while your "significant other" wants more connection and closeness. If he or she starts complaining about your activities, don't retaliate by painting your partner as a jailer, a warden, or an albatross around your neck. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>It's natural to get defensive when you're criticized, but don't fight back. Instead, listen to what's underlying the words: the message that this person might feel neglected and unloved. It may take a lot of patient questioning on your part, and it may require some breathing space, but don't let your anger—or a partner's—let a discussion spin out of control. Keeping your cool can keep the situation from becoming a disastrous one.

<BR><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management Techniques #5: 
<BR><U>Use Humor</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>"Silly humor" can help defuse rage in a number of ways. For one thing, it can help you get a more balanced perspective. When you get angry and call someone a name or refer to them in some imaginative phrase, stop and picture what that word would literally look like. If you're at work and you think of a coworker as a "dirtbag" or a "single-cell life form," for example, picture a large bag full of dirt (or an amoeba) sitting at your colleague's desk, talking on the phone, going to meetings. Do this whenever a name comes into your head about another person. If you can, draw a picture of what the actual thing might look like. This will take a lot of the edge off your fury; and humor can always be relied on to help unknot a tense situation. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>The underlying message of highly angry people, Dr. Deffenbacher says, is "things oughta go my way!" Angry people tend to feel that they are morally right, that any blocking or changing of their plans is an unbearable indignity and that they should NOT have to suffer this way. Maybe other people do, but not them! </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>When you feel that urge, he suggests, picture yourself as a god or goddess, a supreme ruler, who owns the streets and stores and office space, striding alone and having your way in all situations while others defer to you. The more detail you can get into your imaginary scenes, the more chances you have to realize that maybe you are being unreasonable; you'll also realize how unimportant the things you're angry about really are. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>There are two cautions in using humor. First, don't try to just "laugh off" your problems; rather, use humor to help yourself face them more constructively. Second, don't give in to harsh, sarcastic humor; that's just another form of unhealthy anger expression. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>What these techniques have in common is a refusal to take yourself too seriously. Anger is a serious emotion, but it's often accompanied by ideas that, if examined, can make you laugh.</FONT>

<BR><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management Techniques #6: 
<BR><U>Change Your Environment</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Sometimes it's our immediate surroundings that give us cause for irritation and fury. Problems and responsibilities can weigh on you and make you feel angry at the "trap" you seem to have fallen into and all the people and things that form that trap. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Give yourself a break. Make sure you have some "personal time" scheduled for times of the day that you know are particularly stressful. One example is the working mother who has a standing rule that when she comes home from work, for the first 15 minutes "nobody talks to Mom unless the house is on fire." After this brief quiet time, she feels better prepared to handle demands from her kids without blowing up at them. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Change the timing of events. If you and your spouse tend to fight when you discuss things at night -- perhaps you're tired, or distracted, or maybe it's just habit -- try changing the times when you talk about important matters so these talks don't turn into arguments. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Avoid the source of irritation. If your child's chaotic room makes you furious every time you walk by it, shut the door. Don't make yourself look at what infuriates you. Don't say, "well, my child should clean up the room so I won't have to be angry!" That's not the point. The point is to keep yourself calm. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Discover alternatives: If your daily commute through traffic leaves you in a state of rage and frustration, give yourself a project: learn or map out a different route, one that's less congested or more scenic. Or find another alternative, such as a bus or commuter train..</FONT>

<BR><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Anger Management Techniques #7: 
<BR><U>Exercise</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Physical activity is a great way to reduce angry feelings. It gives you a chance to focus your mind on something else. Once your body is hard at work, you will be less likely to obsess over angry feelings. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Vigorous activities such as running and kickboxing are healthy ways to release angry energy that has built up. Follow the intense portion of your workout with something soothing, such as meditation or yoga, to help you relax.</FONT> .

<BR><U>Avoid Artificial Stimulants</U></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Stimulants like sugar, caffeine and nicotine speed up the nervous and cardiovascular systems, which can add to the symptoms of anger. If you have recurrent problems with anger, staying away from these items can help. Avoiding them will also produce other health benefits beyond anger reduction. </FONT>
