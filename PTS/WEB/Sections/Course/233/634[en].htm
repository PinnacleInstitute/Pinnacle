<P align=left><FONT size=3>There are psychological tests that measure the intensity of angry feelings, how prone to anger you are, and how well you handle it. But chances are good that if you do have a problem with anger, you already know it. If you find yourself acting in ways that seem out of control and frightening, you might need help finding better ways to deal with this emotion.</FONT> 
<P align=left><H4><FONT color=#ff0000>Why Are Some People More Angry than Others?</A></FONT></H4>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>Some people really are more "hotheaded" than others are. They get angry more easily and more intensely than the average person does. There are also those who don't show their anger in loud spectacular ways but are chronically irritable and grumpy. Easily angered people don't always curse and throw things; sometimes they withdraw socially, sulk, or get physically ill. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>People who are easily angered generally have what some psychologists call a low tolerance for frustration, meaning simply that they feel that they should not have to be subjected to frustration, inconvenience, or annoyance. They can't take things in stride, and they're particularly infuriated if the situation seems somehow unjust: for example, being corrected for a minor mistake. </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT size=3>What makes these people predisposed toward anger? </FONT>

<LI><FONT size=3>Genetic or physiological: There is evidence that some children are born irritable, touchy, and easily angered, and that these signs are present from a very early age. </FONT>
<P align=left>
<LI><FONT size=3>Socio-cultural. Anger is often regarded as negative; we're taught that it's all right to express anxiety, depression, or other emotions but not to express anger. As a result, we don't learn how to handle it or channel it constructively. </FONT>
<P align=left>
<LI><FONT size=3>Family background. Family background plays a role. Typically, people who are easily angered come from families that are disruptive, chaotic, and not skilled at emotional communications.</FONT>
