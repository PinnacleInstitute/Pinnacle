<LI><B>Investment Goals <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;Who do you want to invest? What do you hope to achieve with your investments? Most specific investment goals fall into three groups: 
<OL type=a>
<P>
<LI><B>Present Income <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;You need to receive current income from your investments. People who are retired or who have children in college are examples of those with present income as an investment goal. 
<P>
<LI><B>Capital Growth <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;You want to increase the value of what you invest, usually over a long period of time. If retirement is several years away or a child is young and many years from post-secondary education, capital growth will be a major investment goal. 
<P>
<LI><B>Capital Preservation <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;You want to be sure what you invest keeps its value in the future. Retirement, or when inflation is racing along in double-digits, are situations where capital preservation would be an investment goal. 
<P>
<LI><B><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tax Considerations</FONT> <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;You want to shelter present income from taxes. This is a valid consideration no matter what your income level. 
<P>You need to know your investment goals because the investments alternatives you choose depend on your goals. If you work with an investment adviser, that person also will need to know your investment goals. 
<P>Another important consideration when discussing investment goals is priority. Most people have goals which fall in two or more of the above categories. Depending on their situation, one goal will have priority.

<P>
<LI><B>Time Available For Working With Investments <I> -</I>  </B>&nbsp;Investments take different amounts of time to manage. Even a C.D. sitting in a safe deposit box takes management time. Are you willing to devote a great deal of time to managing investments? Or do you want an investment that will take a minimal amount of time? 
<P>
<LI><B>Your Knowledge of Investment Alternatives <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;How much do you know, or are you willing to learn, about the different investment alternatives? How much research are you willing to do to keep up with your investments? Investment advisers recommend investing in what you know about or are willing to learn about. Even if you work with an investment advisor, you will need a certain amount of knowledge so you can ask questions. 
<P>
<LI><B>Amount to Invest <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;Realistically, how much money do you have to invest? Is money available for investment a one time occurrence such as $5,000 from an inheritance, or do you expect to have a certain amount for a each specific time period such as $50 per month from current cash flow. 
<P>
<LI><B>Amount to Lose <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;What amount, if any, can you afford to lose? If that figure is zero, you will choose different investments from someone who could afford a loss. 
<P>
<LI><B>Present Asset Situation <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;What is your present asset situation? What do you own? How do your assets match your investment goals? Are your assets diversified enough to spread your investment risk? 
<P>
<LI><B>Temperament<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;How comfortable are you with risk? We all have different temperaments and different tolerance levels when it comes to risk. If an investment causes you to lose sleep or not eat, you are involved with an investment with a higher risk level than those included in your personal risk-comfort zone.
