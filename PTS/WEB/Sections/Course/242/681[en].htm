<LI><I><B>Emergency Fund -</B></I>&nbsp;Financial experts say you need the equivalent of three to six months' living expenses set aside for emergencies. This is money that will not be used for long-term investing, and, according to the definition of savings and investing is more saving than investing. The exact amount that you need to have in an emergency fund depends on your situation. For example, you need less in an emergency fund if you have adequate insurance coverage. 
<P>Why do you need an emergency fund before you start to invest? You need an emergency fund so you do not have to cash in investments to cover a financial emergency. Should such an emergency occur, it may not be the best time to cash in those investments, or you may have to pay a penalty to get your money. An emergency fund provides you with cash to cover financial emergencies. 
<P>Emergency funds should be kept liquid. Liquidity means such funds are in the form of cash or easily converted to cash. Examples of where you may want to keep your emergency fund include passbook savings, short-term certificates of deposit, or money market accounts.

You'll need health insurance with good major medical and catastrophic coverage, disability income insurance for breadwinners, life insurance as income protection for dependents, property and vehicle insurance for your possessions, and liability coverage. Exactly what type of insurance and how much is needed is determined by your situation.

<LI><I><B>Equity in a Home -</B></I>&nbsp;This requirement depends on one's values. If home ownership is important, some equity in a home is needed before starting to invest. If home ownership is not important or home ownership is the reason for investing, meeting this requirement is not necessary before starting to invest.
