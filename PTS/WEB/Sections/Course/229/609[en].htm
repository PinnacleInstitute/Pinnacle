<H2 align=center><A name=1>What are anxiety disorders? Are they common? </A></H2>
<P><FONT size=2>Everybody knows what it's like to feel anxious - the butterflies in your stomach before a first date, the tension you feel when your boss is angry, the way your heart pounds if you're in danger. Anxiety isn't always a bad thing. It can help you cope with life's everyday stress. It makes you study harder for that exam, keeps you on your toes when you're making a speech, and helps you stay focused when looking for a job or asking for a raise. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>But if you have an <B>anxiety disorder</B>, this normally helpful emotion can do just the opposite. It can keep you from coping and can disrupt your daily life. Anxiety disorders aren't just a case of "nerves." They are serious illnesses that can grow worse when not treated. They are thought to be related to the biological makeup and life experiences of a person, and often run in families. Every year, more than 19 million American adults suffer from anxiety disorders. There are treatments for these disorders that can help people lead full and healthy lives. And, research is being done to find new ways to help people with anxiety disorders.</FONT> <H3><A name=2>What are the different types of anxiety disorders and what are their symptoms? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=2>There are five types of anxiety disorders, each with different symptoms. They include: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) - constant and exaggerated (more than normal) worry and tension about everyday life events and decisions that lasts for at least six months. A person fears the worst, even though there may be little reason to expect so. Physical symptoms can also happen, such as fatigue, trembling, muscle tension, headache, or nausea. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) - repeated, unwanted thoughts (<I> obsessions</I> ) or ritual behaviors (<I> compulsions</I> ) that a person feels they can't control or stop. A person can sometimes feel an urgent need to perform a ritual behavior, such as always washing hands three times because three is a "good luck" number and one isn't. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Panic disorder - feelings of extreme fear and dread that strike with no warning and for no reason. These feelings can happen over and over again. A person can have physical symptoms, such as chest pain, heart palpitations (heart beating fast or skipping beats), shortness of breath, dizziness, stomach problems, feeling disoriented or not "real," and have a fear of dying. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2>Phobias - includes <I>social phobia</I> , an extreme fear of being embarrassed, judged, or made fun of in social or work situations and <I>specific phobia</I> , an extreme fear of an object or situation that poses little or no danger. People with phobias often avoid certain situations (like public speaking or parties) or objects (like elevators). Phobias can affect a person's career, relationships, and daily life activities. </FONT>
<LI>
<P align=left><FONT size=2><B>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</B> - involves how a person reacts to a very frightening or stressful event, such as being tortured or put in a prison camp during a war, seeing another person being hurt or killed, or raped. With PTSD, a person can keep re-living the event with nightmares and flashbacks. They can feel numb, depressed, angry, irritable, and jumpy. Family members of victims can also develop PTSD.</FONT>
</UL><H3><A name=3>How are anxiety disorders treated? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=2>Anxiety disorders are among the most common of all the mental disorders. Many people misunderstand these disorders and think people should be able to overcome the symptoms by sheer willpower. But, the symptoms can't be willed or wished away. There are treatments, developed through research, that work well for these disorders. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>Anxiety disorders are treated in two ways - with medication and with certain types of psychotherapy (sometimes called "talk therapy"). Sometimes only one treatment is used or both treatments are combined. If you have an anxiety disorder, talk with your doctor about what will work best for you. If you do choose psychotherapy, make sure the therapist is able to provide you with medication, if needed. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>A number of drugs used for treating <B>depression</B>, called <I><B>antidepressants</B></I> , have been found to help with anxiety disorders as well. <I>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</I> (MAOIs) are used, along with the newer <I>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</I> (SSRIs). Other medicines include anti-anxiety drugs called <I>benzodiazepines </I>and <I>beta-blockers</I> . </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>Treatment with psychotherapy includes <I>cognitive-behavioral therapy</I> (CBT) and <I>behavioral therapy</I> . In CBT, the goal is to change how a person thinks about, and then reacts to, a situation that makes them anxious or fearful. In behavioral therapy, the focus is on changing how a person reacts to a situation. CBT or behavioral therapy most often lasts for 12 weeks. It can be group or individual therapy. Some studies have shown that the benefits of CBT or behavioral therapy last longer than do those of medications for people with panic disorder, OCD, PTSD, and social phobia. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=2>Keep in mind that it can be a challenge to find the right treatment for an anxiety disorder. But, if one treatment doesn't work, the odds are good that another one will. Your doctor and therapist will work together to help you find the best approach. New treatments are being developed through ongoing research. So, don't give up hope. If you have recovered from an anxiety disorder and it comes back at a later date, don't think that you've failed. You can be treated again.

<BR><A name=1>What is generalized anxiety disorder? </A></H2>
<P>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a real illness, called an <I><B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#anxiety_disorder">anxiety disorder</A></B></I> . It's not just simply worrying, and it can be treated to help a person have a healthy and full life. From time to time, we all have worries about our health, family, money, and work. But when a person has GAD, they worry all the time, even when nothing is wrong. A person with GAD always expects the worst will happen, can't relax, and feels tense most of the time. Aches and pains, plus feeling tired a lot, can also happen with GAD. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Just the thought of getting through the day causes anxiety. 
<P>It's important to know that when a person has this illness, it's not her or his fault. And, it's not something a person can just "snap out of." No one knows for sure what causes GAD. Most often GAD begins in childhood, but can start in an adult as well. More women than men have this illness. And, GAD may run in families. <H3><A name=2>What are the symptoms of GAD? </A></H3>
<P>The biggest symptom of GAD is constant worry. Physical symptoms can also happen. Research suggests that GAD symptoms can become worse when a person is under stress. Symptoms include: 
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left>Constant worrying about things both big and small. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Aches and pains, including headaches, for no reason. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Trembling and muscle tension. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Feeling tense and unable to relax. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Feeling tired all the time.

<P align=left>Having trouble staying focused or not being able to keep your mind on one thing.

<P align=left>Feeling irritable or grouchy. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Trouble falling or staying asleep. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Sweating or hot flashes. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Having a lump in the throat or feeling like you need to throw up when you're worried. 
</UL>
<P align=left>Many people with GAD startle more easily than other people. They sometimes suffer from <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#depression">depression</A></B>, too. 
<P>Most people with GAD have mild symptoms that don't limit them in regards to social settings or in the work place. Unlike other anxiety disorders, people don't usually avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. But, GAD can be severe for some people, making it hard to do even the simplest daily tasks. The symptoms of GAD tend to lessen with age. <H3><A name=3>What should I do if I think I have GAD? </A></H3>
<P>If you think you may have symptoms of GAD, a visit to your doctor is the best place to start. Your doctor will perform a careful exam to figure out whether your symptoms are really due to GAD, or if you have another anxiety disorder or problem. Be aware that all anxiety disorders are not treated the same. GAD is diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worrying too much about everyday problems.

<BR><A name=1>What is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? </A></H2>
<P>OCD is a real illness that can be treated with medicine and therapy. When you have OCD, you have recurring, upsetting thoughts (called <I>obsessions</I> ). You repeat doing the same thing, over and over again (called <I>compulsions</I> ) to make the thoughts go away. And, you feel like you can't control or stop these thoughts or actions. The obsessions, or upsetting thoughts, can include things like a fear of germs, a fear of being hurt, a fear of hurting others, and disturbing religious or sexual thoughts. The compulsions, or actions you repeat to make the thoughts go away, can be things like counting, cleaning, hand washing, and checking on things. While these actions provide only short-lived relief, not doing them only increases anxiety. 
<P>Many people who have OCD know that their actions often don't make sense. They may try to hide their problem from family and friends, and may have trouble keeping a job because of their actions. Without treatment, obsessions and the need to perform rituals can take over a person's life. OCD is an <I><B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#anxiety_disorder">anxiety disorder</A></B></I> that can be life-long. A person with OCD can also recover and then get the illness again, or relapse. This illness affects women and men in equal numbers. Most often, OCD begins during the teenage years or early childhood, although it can start in an adult. 
<P>The exact cause of OCD is not known. Researchers are looking at differences in brain activity among people who have OCD and persons who do not, for clues about it's cause. OCD is not caused by family problems. Nor is it caused by something in a person's childhood, such as an unusual focus on cleanliness, or a belief that certain thoughts are dangerous or wrong. It's important to know that when a person has OCD, it's not her or his fault. And, it's not something a person can just "snap out of." <H3><A name=2>What are the symptoms of OCD? </A></H3>
<P>OCD shouldn't be confused with sometimes acting "compulsive." Individuals who act this way expect a lot from themselves, are very organized in their work and play, and are sometimes called "perfectionists." This type of "compulsiveness" often has value in a person's life. It can help a person feel good about themselves and help them be a success on the job. It differs greatly from OCD, which is an illness that can have a devastating effect on a person's life. 
<P>Symptoms of OCD include: 
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left>Having upsetting thoughts or images enter your mind again and again. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Feeling like you can't stop these thoughts or images, even though you want to. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Having a hard time stopping yourself from doing things again and again, like counting, checking on things, washing your hands, cleaning, re-arranging objects, doing things until it feels "right," or collecting useless objects. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Worrying a lot about terrible things that could happen if you're not careful. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Having unwanted urges to hurt someone, but knowing you never would. 
</UL>
<P>People with OCD sometimes also abuse alcohol and drugs and can have other illnesses, such as <A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#depression"><B>depression</B></A>, eating disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or other anxiety disorders. When a person also has other illnesses, OCD is often harder to diagnose and treat. <H3><A name=3>What should I do if I think I have OCD? </A></H3>
<P>If you think you may have symptoms of OCD, a visit to your doctor is the best place to start. Your doctor will perform a careful exam to figure out whether your symptoms are really due to this illness, or if you have another anxiety disorder or problem. 
<P>Sometimes a person can feel awkward talking to a health care provider about OCD. They may blame themselves, think their condition is not serious, or feel embarrassed. Keep in mind that this illness can be treated. Be aware that all anxiety disorders are not treated the same.

<P>Panic disorder is a real illness that can be treated to help a person have a healthy and full life. It is a type of <I><B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#anxiety_disorder">anxiety disorder</A></B></I> . With this disorder, a person can feel frequent and sudden intense fear for no reason. These frequent "bursts" of intense fear are called panic attacks. During these attacks, you can have scary physical feelings like a fast heartbeat, trouble breathing, or dizziness. 
<P>Panic attacks can happen at any time and without any warning. They can happen anywhere - in grocery stores, malls, crowds, or when traveling. A person can live in constant fear of another attack, staying away from places where past attacks have happened. This fear can take over a person's life, making her or him unable to leave their home (a condition called <I>agorophobia</I> ). While panic attacks don't last long, they are scary, making them feel like they could last forever. This disorder can last for a few months or go on for many years, even with treatment. 
<P>It's important to know that when a person has this illness, it's not her or his fault. And, it's not something a person can just "snap out of." No one knows for sure what causes panic disorder. It most often starts when people are young, around 18 to 24 years old. It also can begin when a person is already under a lot of stress, such as after the death of a loved one or having a baby. While anyone can have this disorder, it affects women more than it does men. And, it can run in families. <H3><A name=2>What are the symptoms of panic disorder? </A></H3>

<P>Panic disorder is not the same as everyday anxiety. This disorder usually doesn't go away by itself. But, with proper treatment, a person with this illness can be helped. If it is not treated, the illness can take over a person's life and affect relationships and work. A person can also become very depressed without treatment, turning to alcohol and drugs for relief. <H3><A name=3>What should I do if I think I have panic disorder? </A></H3>

If you do choose psychotherapy, make sure the therapist is able to provide you with medication, if needed. 
<P>A number of drugs used for treating <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#depression">depression</A></B>, called <I><B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#antidepressants">antidepressants</A></B></I> , have been found to help with anxiety disorders as well. <I>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</I> (MAOIs) are used, along with the newer <I>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</I> (SSRIs). Other medicines include anti-anxiety drugs called <I>benzodiazepines</I> and <I>beta-blockers. </I>
<P>Treatment with psychotherapy includes<I> cognitive-behavioral therapy </I>(CBT) and <I>behavioral therapy</I> . In CBT, the goal is to change how a person thinks about, and then reacts to, a situation that makes them anxious or fearful. In behavioral therapy, the focus is on changing how a person reacts to a situation. CBT or behavioral therapy most often lasts for 12 weeks. It can be group or individual therapy. Some studies have shown that the benefits of CBT or behavioral therapy last longer than do those of medications for people with panic disorder. 
<P>Keep in mind that it can be a challenge to find the right treatment for an anxiety disorder. But, if one treatment doesn't work, the odds are good that another one will. Your doctor and therapist will work together to help you find the best approach. New treatments are being developed through ongoing research. So, don't give up hope. If you have recovered from an anxiety disorder and it comes back at a later date, don't think that you've failed. You can be treated again. And, the skills you learned dealing with the disorder the first time can help you in coping with it again. <H3><A name=5>What can I do to help myself if I have panic disorder? </A></H3>
<P>Many people find it helps to join a support group because they can share their problems and successes with others who are going through the same thing. While it doesn't take the place of mental health care, talking with trusted friends or a member of your faith community can also be very helpful. Family members can play an important role in a person's treatment by offering support. Learning how to manage stress will help you to stay calm and focused. Research suggests that aerobic exercise (like jogging, bicycling and swimming) may be of value as well. Other studies have found that caffeine, illegal drugs, and some over-the-counter cold medicines can worsen the symptoms of these disorders. Check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medicines.

<BR>&nbsp; <H2 align=center><A name=1>What is a phobia?</A></H2>
<P>A phobia is something a person fears to the point that they feel they have to change how they behave. One type of phobia, called <I>specific phobia</I> , can involve fear of an object (like an elevator) or a situation (like public speaking) that poses little or no danger. Phobias can also involve fear of being embarrassed, looked at, or made fun of in social or work situations. These are called <I>social phobias</I> . With both of these phobias, the fear is extreme and hard to control. Without treatment, phobias can last many years and affect a person's career, relationships, and daily life activities. Both specific and social phobias are types of <I><B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#anxiety_disorder">anxiety disorders</A></B>. </I>
<P>It's important to know that when a person has a specific or social phobia, it's not her or his fault. And, it's not something a person can just "snap out of." No one knows for sure what causes phobias. <H3><A name=2>What are specific phobias and what are the symptoms?</A></H3>
<P>Specific phobias are common - they strike 1 out of every 10 Americans. Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from this illness. Starting in the teenage and adult years, they may run in families. They begin suddenly and tend to last longer than childhood phobias (like being afraid of the dark). 
<P>When a person has a specific phobia, they have an intense fear of something that poses little or no real danger. Because there is no or little danger, a person's fear is not based on reality (called <I>irrational fear</I> ). Some of the more common specific phobias involve fear of closed-in places, heights, escalators, elevators, tunnels, highway driving, bridges, water, flying, dogs, and injuries involving blood. And, a specific phobia often makes no sense. For instance, you may be able to jump out of airplanes with ease but not be able to go above the 4<SUP>th</SUP> floor of an office building. Most people with these phobias know that they don't make sense. But, facing their fear, or even thinking about it, can bring on a panic attack or severe anxiety. 
<P>Specific phobias can be treated, helping a person have a full and healthy life. But, when the object of the fear is easy to avoid, a person may decide to do so rather than get treatment. Not getting treatment, though, can cause a person to make decisions that will affect their personal life and limit their career. Go to the question on how are phobias treated for more information. <H3><A name=3>What are social phobias and what are the symptoms?</A></H3>
<P>Social phobia involves feeling very self-conscious in everyday social situations. It is more than just being shy or nervous, and can cause extreme anxiety. A person can feel afraid and uncomfortable when around other people. It may be hard to be at work or school, when you have to interact with others. While many people with these phobias know that their fear may be extreme, they are unable to control it. They often worry for days or weeks in advance of a situation they are dreading. This illness most often starts in childhood or the teenage years, and may run in families. Women are just as likely as men to develop social phobia. Other anxiety disorders or <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#depression">depression</A></B> often go hand-in-hand with this phobia. Some people also turn to alcohol or drugs for relief. 
<P>Symptoms include: 
<UL>
<LI>
<P align=left>Intense fear that you will do or say something and embarrass yourself in front of other people. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Always being afraid of making a mistake and being watched and judged by other people.

<P align=left>Avoiding doing things you want to or speaking to people because you fear being embarrassed. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Worrying for days or weeks before you have to meet new people. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Blushing, sweating a lot, trembling, nausea, or feeling like you have to throw up before and during an event where you are with new people. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Staying away from social situations such as school events and making speeches. 
<LI>
<P align=left>Drinking alcohol to make your fears go away. 
</UL>
<P>People who have social phobias most often know that their fears don't make sense. But, even if they manage to face what they fear, they can still feel anxious and uncomfortable. Social phobias can be treated, helping a person have a full and healthy life. Not getting treatment can cause a person to make decisions that will affect their personal life. Go to the question on how are phobias treated for more information. <H3><A name=4>What should I do if I think I have a phobia?</A></H3>
<P>If you think you may have symptoms of a specific or social phobia, a visit to your doctor is the best place to start. Your doctor will perform a careful exam to figure out whether your symptoms are really due to this illness, or if you have another anxiety disorder or problem. 
<P>Sometimes a person can feel awkward talking to a health care provider about phobias. They may blame themselves, think their condition is not serious, or feel embarrassed. Keep in mind that this illness can be treated. Be aware that all anxiety disorders are not treated the same. 
<P>The next step your doctor may suggest is a visit with a mental health professional. This includes <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#psychiatrist">psychiatrists</A></B>, <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#psychologist">psychologists</A></B>, <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#social_worker">social workers</A></B>, and <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#counselor">counselors</A></B>. It is best to look for a professional who has special training in cognitive-behavioral and/or behavioral therapy. Try to find someone who is open to the use of medications, should they be needed. And if they are not a medical doctor, be sure they work with one so medication can be prescribed. Keep in mind that when you start taking medicine, it may not start working right away. You need to give your body a few weeks to get used to the medicine. Then, you and your doctor can decide if it's working. 
<P>You can get free information about anxiety disorders from the National Institute of Mental Health. Call toll free 1-88-88-ANXIETY. 
<P>It's very important that you feel comfortable with your treatment. If this is not the case, seek help elsewhere. If you've been taking medication, don't stop it all of a sudden. These drugs need to be tapered off slowly, under the care of your doctor. Talk with your doctor about how to stop the medication you're taking. <H3><A name=5>How are phobias treated?</A></H3>
<P>Phobias are a type of anxiety disorder, the most common of all the mental disorders. Many people misunderstand these disorders and think people should be able to overcome the symptoms by sheer willpower. But, the symptoms can't be willed or wished away. There are treatments, developed through research, that work well for these disorders.

Relaxation and breathing exercises can also help reduce anxiety symptoms. Some studies have shown that the benefits of CBT or behavioral therapy last longer than do those of medications for people with phobias.

<BR>&nbsp; <H2 align=center>What is post-traumatic stress disorder and how is it treated?</H2>
<P>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#debilitating"><I>debilitating</I></A></B> condition that follows a terrifying event. Often, people with PTSD have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal and feel emotionally numb, especially with people to whom they were once close. 
<P>War veterans first brought PTSD, once referred to as shell shock or battle fatigue, to the public's attention, but it can result from any number of traumatic incidents. These include kidnapping, serious accidents such as car or train wrecks, natural disasters such as floods or earthquakes, violent attacks such as a mugging, rape, torture, or being held captive. The event that triggers it may be something that threatened the person's life or the life of someone close to her or him. Or it could be something witnessed, such as mass destruction after a plane crash or a terrorist incident. 
<P>Whatever the source of the problem, some people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in the form of nightmares and disturbing recollections during the day. They may also experience sleep problems, <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#depression">depression</A></B>, feeling detached or numb, or being easily startled. They may lose interest in things they used to enjoy and have trouble feeling affectionate. They may feel irritable, more aggressive than before, or even violent. Seeing things that remind them of the incident may be very distressing, which could lead them to avoid certain places or situations that bring back those memories. Anniversaries of the event are often very difficult. 
<P>PTSD can occur at any age, including childhood. The disorder can be accompanied by depression, substance abuse, or anxiety. Symptoms may be mild or severe — people may become easily irritated or have violent outbursts. In severe cases, they may have trouble working or socializing. In general, the symptoms seem to be worse if the event that triggered them was initiated by a person — such as a rape, as opposed to a flood. 
<P>Ordinary events can serve as reminders of the trauma and trigger flashbacks or intrusive images. A flashback may make the person lose touch with reality and reenact the event for a period of seconds or hours, or very rarely, days. A person having a flashback, which can come in the form of images, sounds, smells, or feelings, usually believes that the traumatic event is happening all over again. 
<P>Not every traumatized person gets full-blown PTSD, or experiences PTSD at all. Most people who are exposed to a traumatic, stressful event experience some of the symptoms of PTSD in the days and weeks following exposure, but the symptoms generally decrease over time and eventually disappear. However, about 8 percent of men and 20 percent of women go on to develop PTSD, and roughly 30 percent of these individuals develop a <B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#chronic">chronic</A></B> form that persists throughout their lifetimes. PTSD is diagnosed only if the symptoms last more than a month. 
<P>Some people recover within 6 months, others have symptoms that last much longer. In some cases, the condition may be chronic. Occasionally, the illness doesn't show up until years after the traumatic event. 
<P><B><A href="http://www.4woman.gov/Glossary/index.htm#antidepressants">Antidepressants</A></B> and anxiety-reducing medications can ease the symptoms of depression and sleep problems; and psychotherapy, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, is an integral part of treatment. Being exposed to a reminder of the trauma as part of therapy - such as returning to the scene of a rape - sometimes helps. And support from family and friends can help speed recovery.

<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Generalized Anxiety Disorder - excessive anxiety and worry for at least 6 months with accompanying symptoms of restlessness, feeling keyed up, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. 
<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Panic Disorder - intense fear or terror that strikes suddenly and repeatedly with no warning, accompanied by symptoms such as a pounding heart, chest pains, dizziness, nausea, shortness of breath, shaking, tingling, sweating, fear of going crazy and fear of dying. 
<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Phobias - a marked and persistent fear of specific objects or situations, or a fear of social or performance situations where we might suffer embarrassment or humiliation. 
<BR></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - persistent unwelcome thoughts or rituals we seem driven to perform which markedly interfere with our normal daily routine.

<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=2><B>How is anxiety different from fear?</B> 
<BR></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Fear usually involves uneasiness and apprehension directed toward some concrete, external object or situation. Also, fear is associated with events or situations that could happen. Anxiety, on the other hand, is more of a subjective state of uneasiness and apprehension in response to a vague and sometimes unrecognized danger. With anxiety, we cannot always specify what it is we are anxious about. Often, anxiety tends to be out of proportion and unrealistic.

<LI><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=2><B>Is there any value in worrying?</B> 
<BR></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>We sometimes feel worrying about something helps us better prepare for dealing with it. What usually happens however, is that worrying increases our anxiety which in turn can interfere with daily functions like thinking clearly and making decisions. Planning, doing what we can and then placing thing in the hands of the Lord is a better way to prepare and deal with difficult or scary situations.

<BR></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Everyone experiences anxiety at different times during the day or week. Most of the time those feelings appear and leave rather quickly. If our anxious feelings don't leave after an extended time, and their intensity interferes with our daily activities, it may be beneficial to seek professional help.

<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The beginning of the semester is usually a time of high anxiety as we wonder about our teachers, the amount of work for our classes, and meeting the financial strain of housing and food. The second time anxiety is likely to appear is just before mid-term and final examinations, particularly if we are on the borderline of good academic standing.

<BR></FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>One reliable method is to move our body and change our mind. Engaging in body movement which involves use of the large muscles is particularly effective.
