<FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Most lectures, textbook passages, and informational articles have a logical structure that can be represented on an outline.&nbsp; Simply, an outline is a hierarchy of information.&nbsp; It contains several main points, each with subpoints and details to expand on the main ideas.&nbsp; Understanding and using outlines is an important study skill related to efficient note-taking, getting information from reading material, and organizing information to make it easier to remember. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Scientists tell us that learning is a process of organizing information and relating new ideas to previously mastered concepts.&nbsp; Studies show, for example, that test subjects remember organized and meaningful information much more readily than random, isolated bits.&nbsp; Outlining can help you impose order on the information that you need to learn.&nbsp; It is a tool that will make the job of learning that much more organized and easier.&nbsp; As you listen to class lectures, read textbooks or articles, and even participate in discussions, you will be able to put the information into order and make it easier to remember and learn.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Unfortunately, outlining seems to be a dying art.&nbsp; Many schools give it only a cursory discussion at some point in upper elementary school or middle school, then assume that students understand it and can use it effectively.&nbsp; High school teachers are often dismayed that students do not know how to create or use outlines, but often can’t take the time to reteach the information.&nbsp; Here is a crash course in outlining!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">An outline is essentially a skeleton of information contained in a lecture or reading material.&nbsp; Outlines also can be written before the piece is written and can serve to organize thoughts to prepare for writing.&nbsp; This skeleton gives main points of the piece, shows information about each main point, and provides details or examples for each bit of information.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Main points on an outline are generally designated with Roman numerals.&nbsp; There are typically three to five main points in a lecture, reading passage, or in a piece that is to be written.&nbsp; More main points often make the communication long, unfocused, and confusing.&nbsp; These main points can generally be summed up in a short phrase or sentence.&nbsp; To be technically correct, the main points should employ the same grammatical structure.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Under each main point, there are a set of subtopics.&nbsp; The subtopics explain what is important and memorable about each of the main points.&nbsp; There should be at least two subtopics for each of the main points.&nbsp; If there is only one or no subtopics apparent, it’s likely that the main point is not truly a main point.&nbsp; Perhaps it is a disguised subtopic from another main point, or possibly it just isn’t important enough to warrant main point/Roman numeral status.&nbsp; Subtopics are designated with capital letters, slightly indented from the Roman numerals.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Each subtopic should be supported by at least two details.&nbsp; Details show in an outline by indenting another level under each of the subtopics with their capital letters.&nbsp; The detailed information is designated by using Arabic numerals.&nbsp; Each detail can also have supporting details or examples, indented another level and labeled with lower case letters.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Outlines provide a framework for organizing information.&nbsp; You can see at a glance how ideas and facts fit together and what is related to what.&nbsp; This also can aid memory.&nbsp; Organized information is more easily recalled, and more easily used to form answers to test questions.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>To provide you with a concrete example, I’ve included an outline of this lesson.&nbsp; You should be able to pick out each part and see where it came from in the piece.</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Take a look at this outline.&nbsp; I’m sure you remember reading in the beginning of this lesson about the importance of outlining.&nbsp; I discussed why this skill is so important for students and the different aspects of learning that it can affect.&nbsp; The introductory section also included some information about how outlining actually aides the learning process.&nbsp; I chose to begin in this fashion to convince you that this skill will be valuable to you.&nbsp; It’s important to begin any piece with things that will convince the reader to continue reading!&nbsp; A good introduction will provide the reader with reasons to continue on through the piece.&nbsp; The introduction for this piece is contained in the first three paragraphs.&nbsp; Take a look right now and see if you can discover the shift from the first point in the outline, the introduction, to the second point, basic information about how outlines work.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Of course, we are in the middle of the second section of the outline right now.&nbsp; This is the explanation of how an outline works and is set up.&nbsp; If you look ahead, you’ll see that we &nbsp;will be discussing strategies for picking out the outline structure of a lecture or a written piece.&nbsp; Finally, the last point of the outline, ways to practice and develop your own outlining skills, will be discussed at the end of the lesson.&nbsp; After you’ve read through the lesson, try coming back to this section and see if you can match the outline points up to paragraphs and sentences.&nbsp; It’ll be great practice!</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Now that you’ve seen how an outline translates into a piece, let’s discover how to dig down to the skeleton of a passage of text.&nbsp; Every text has an underlying structure and by searching it out, you will be better able to learn the material.&nbsp; You will see connections between the materials you are reading and things you already know and understand.&nbsp; These “hooks” will help you master the new materials.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">The first clues lie in the basic structure of the book itself.&nbsp; Most textbooks are divided into units, chapters, and sections.&nbsp; These headings will form the outline for the entire book.&nbsp; If you look at a chapter, you can make another, more detailed outline of the material it contains.&nbsp; The chapter title will indicate the subject of the outline, the section headings are the main points, and the topic sentences of many of the paragraphs are the subpoints.&nbsp; Details will be found within the paragraphs.&nbsp; Look at any textbook and see if you can pick these things out.&nbsp; Choose a chapter and outline it by using these clues.&nbsp; You’ll find that your outline sort of creates itself!&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Oral presentations are a bit more challenging to outline!&nbsp; You don’t have the benefit of boldfaced print or indented paragraphs.&nbsp; However, a good lecturer will also give clues that can help you discern the outline that he or she is using.&nbsp; There are words that you can listen for, and other ways to figure it out.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Generally speaking, lectures are based on information from the text.&nbsp; It expands and elaborates on the concepts presented in the reading.&nbsp; You will help yourself by preparing thoroughly before the lecture by reading the material carefully, and perhaps outlining it.&nbsp; This will give you a framework for comparison, and let you see how everything connects together.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">The human brain works well with sets of three.&nbsp; There is evidence of this phenomenon throughout our literature and many, many other places.&nbsp; Think of all of the groups of three that are scattered through fairy tales, for example.&nbsp; Even folk literature from other cultures has a preponderance of groups of three.&nbsp; Most lecturers know this fact, as well.&nbsp; Many talks are designed on a three-point outline.&nbsp; Knowing this, you can listen for the three main points.&nbsp; It may even help you to create a blank outline, with three Roman numerals, three points under each, and space beneath each of those to fill in subpoints and details. &nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Many lecturers will also use visual aids that can be turned into outlines.&nbsp; Watch for powerpoint presentations, lists of points put onto overhead projectors, or concepts written on a chalkboard.&nbsp; Handouts may also be organized in outline form, and could give you a framework for your notes.&nbsp; The handouts or the visual aids may not be presented in true outline format, but if the points were important enough for the speaker to write them down for emphasis, chances are very good that they belong in your outline, as well.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Lectures often include transition words between the sections of the outline.&nbsp; Listen for words like “first,” “next,” and “finally.”&nbsp; Other key words include “on the other hand,” “primarily,” “secondly,” and “in conclusion.”&nbsp; These words and others like them often indicate that a new point is being made, and hence a new section of the outline is beginning.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>What a tool!&nbsp; Outlines help you organize information, make connections, and provide a framework for later recall.&nbsp; You can use outlines to help you learn from textbooks, magazine articles, lectures, and even discussions.&nbsp; The skill will help you to learn more and be more efficient.&nbsp; Efficiency will translate into less time spent on learning tasks and more time left over for you to enjoy in other ways.&nbsp; Not a tough choice!</FONT>
