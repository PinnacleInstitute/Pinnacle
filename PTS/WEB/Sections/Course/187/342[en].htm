<FONT size=3><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066>Taking notes can be one of the most valuable academic skills that a student can master, and yet little time is spent in teaching young people effective strategies to take note of important information.&nbsp; Many students move from elementary school and middle school, where notes are simply handed to students in reproduced form, to high school where the teacher admonishes, “Now, take notes on this!&nbsp; The information will be on the test next week!”&nbsp; For students learning in a homeschool setting, formal lectures are uncommon, and some students do not experience this situation until they enter group educational settings in the upper grades or even college.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066 size=3>The fact is that the character of education changes dramatically between the elementary grades and the high school level.&nbsp; Teachers often shift from a hands-on, experiential teaching style to a lecture format.&nbsp; Students are expected to listen and learn from a forty-five minute (or longer) lecture or discussion more frequently than in the lower grades.&nbsp; Students not only need to learn to learn by listening, but they need to master several other essential skills, as well. </FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066 size=3>The first step to taking good notes is to learn to be a good listener. &nbsp;Students will need excellent listening skills in order to master this new task. &nbsp;In high school, college, and in many professional situations, people need to listen, sort, prioritize, and connect information, and make note of the important points for later reference.&nbsp; Exposure to information presented in auditory format is vital.&nbsp; Students&nbsp;who have practiced listening for important information will have a distinct advantage over those who have not.&nbsp; How can one get this sort of practice?&nbsp; Simple!&nbsp; Anytime there is talking going on, try to focus in on what is being said.&nbsp; What is the message?&nbsp; What are the important points?&nbsp; What are the details?&nbsp; What techniques is the speaker using to make the information more memorable?&nbsp; You can use a number of out-of-school experiences to practice listening skills, including listening carefully to sermons in church, actively listening to news broadcasts, and trying to recall the important points of conversations.&nbsp; In each of these circumstances, the speaker is trying to convey a message or other information and wants listeners to recall and retain it.&nbsp; He or she is trying to inform or even to change opinions or behaviors. </FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><FONT color=#000066><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Too many people confuse listening with simply hearing a presentation.&nbsp; There’s more to listening than simply being present!&nbsp; In order for listening to be effective and productive, a person needs to be actively engaged in the process.&nbsp; Sitting in the same room with a lecturer, speaker or teacher does not automatically mean that the information will head into the mind.&nbsp; Hearing is not the same thing as learning, nor is it the same thing as remembering.&nbsp; The attention has a way of wandering off, seeking out thoughts about what will be happening next, daydreaming about the way we wish things were, or recalling something that happened in the past.&nbsp; This happens to everyone, and it takes mental discipline to keep focused on the topic at hand.&nbsp; This kind of discipline only improves with practice.&nbsp; And conversely, if it is not exercised on a regular basis, the ability to sustain attention becomes weak and flabby, and attending to a long lecture or other presentation seems difficult and boring.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><FONT color=#000066><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">It helps if the subject matter is engaging, and it also helps if the presentation is exciting and intriguing.&nbsp; However, not all speakers or teachers have discovered the way to make every presentation all that memorable.&nbsp; Sooner or later, every student will encounter a teacher that just is not interesting or exciting.&nbsp; Lectures seem dull and boring, and it can be very difficult to listen.&nbsp; It can be a chore to simply stay awake and focused, and the chances of learning what the speaker plans for the audience to retain are slim at best.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><FONT color=#000066><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>However, there are some tricks that you can use to compensate for less than lively presentations.&nbsp; The listener is ultimately in control of the process, and can make a conscious choice to listen, attend, and learn.&nbsp; Take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and be in charge of listening.&nbsp; Here are some ideas to try:</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066>Oddly enough, the very act of taking notes improves most people’s listening skills!&nbsp; When charged with the task of writing down important points, most will listen more carefully in order to know what to write down.&nbsp; The more motivated a listener is to gather accurate information, the better the listening.&nbsp; It’s as simple as that.&nbsp; If the presentation is important enough to take notes on, it’s important enough to listen to carefully.&nbsp; In school, grades may be the motivating force.&nbsp; In the workplace, getting information to do the job well is paramount.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066>Listening for the answers to specific questions will help a person to be a better listener, as well.&nbsp; Students who are prepared prior to a lecture will find they are better able to attend to the speaker.&nbsp; Reading text assignments, studying background information, and generally preparing for the lecture ahead of time will make the material more meaningful and provide a framework for the learning.&nbsp; Prepare for listening by generating a list of questions that should be answered during the presentation.&nbsp; List the questions right on the page where you will be taking notes, then write the answers near each one.&nbsp; One way to create questions is to utilize the headings and subheadings of the text.&nbsp; Simply look at the bold-faced print that titles each section and rephrase it into a question.&nbsp; Another technique is to use the topic sentences of paragraphs to generate relevant questions.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><FONT color=#000066><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It can also help to listen specifically to discover the structure of a lecture or speech.&nbsp; Most speakers follow an outline or other organized system of speaking.&nbsp; A listener who tries to recreate that structure will be more attentive.&nbsp; There are many organizational tools that the speaker may be using.&nbsp; During your next lecture, see if you can discern whether the teacher is using an outline, a clustered graphic organizer, a time line, or other organizational tool.&nbsp; You can also create an outline or other organizational structure from the reading material to fill in with information from the presentation.&nbsp; Use titles and subheadings from the text to create the main points of the outline, and then fill other points in as they are presented in the lecture.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066>As you are listening, pay special attention to clue words that the teacher or speaker uses.&nbsp; Many will tell you exactly which points are important by using phrases such as “in summary,” “therefore,” or “most importantly.”&nbsp; Listen for clues such as “There were THREE major causes of the Civil War” or “We will cover SIX heroes from the American West.”&nbsp; When a teacher or presenter gives a number of reasons, points, or other group of things to expect, the wise note-taker will make a numbered list to fill in as the speaker goes over each point.&nbsp; This method has the additional advantage of making it noticeable if a point is missed.&nbsp; The listener can ask about the missing idea or check in reference material later.&nbsp; Words such as “in the first place,” &nbsp;“secondly,” and “finally” tell you that a series of important points are being presented.&nbsp; These often come in groups of threes because our brains work well with that number.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Listen also for “in conclusion” and “most importantly.”&nbsp; These will signify a summary that includes the most important items that you will need to remember from the presentation.&nbsp; Some presenters will even tell you to write specific things down because they are so important!&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><FONT color=#000066><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Information that is written down on overhead, chalkboard, or other audio-visual display is likely to be important and should be copied down verbatim.&nbsp; Most teachers and presenters know that sending information through several perceptual channels increases the retention rate.&nbsp; When students see and hear the same information, it is more likely to be remembered.&nbsp; They also write down information that is likely to show up on a test.&nbsp; It will be important to remember it exactly.&nbsp; To make things simple, write down everything that is presented in visual form.</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066>Finally, it is possible to set goals for listening.&nbsp; This is a good strategy if a student has found him or herself staring at an empty page at the end of each lecture.&nbsp; A goal such as listening for five new facts or filling in a pre-created outline will help a student to learn to take notes.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066>There you have it: five different ways to promote active listening when you need to take notes and retain information.&nbsp; You can use some or all of them in any combination to improve your note-taking skills.&nbsp; Write down clue words, make outlines, listen for the answers to specific questions, copy information from the visual display, and write down everything that seems to be important or that the presenter is repeating.&nbsp; You’ll need to keep this array in mind and utilize the tools that are most appropriate for the setting.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face="Times New Roman" color=#000066 size=3>No matter how you choose to do it, active involvement will help listening skills.&nbsp; Set goals for yourself and give yourself tasks to accomplish.&nbsp; Listening will no longer be a passive activity.&nbsp; Instead of listening with the expectation that information will be automatically poured into your mind, listen to accomplish a goal.&nbsp; You will find that you will take better notes and will retain more with less effort.</FONT>
