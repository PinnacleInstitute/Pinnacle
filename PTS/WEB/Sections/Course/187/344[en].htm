<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>We’ve spent a lot of time during the previous lesson discussing outlines.&nbsp; However, there are other ways to organize information and for some people, these are quite handy.&nbsp; Graphic organizers provide alternative ways of organizing information and making it more memorable.&nbsp; They can shed new light and lead to new understandings of connections.&nbsp; Graphic organizers are valuable tools to have in your learning arsenal.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Perhaps you’ve noticed, as you’ve attended classes and been involved in other learning experiences, that some methods of learning are better for you than others.&nbsp; Is it easier to listen to a lecture to gather information, or would you rather read it?&nbsp; Do you prefer hands-on experiences, where you get to try things out, or would you rather write things down?&nbsp; These kinds of preferences are clues to your learning style.&nbsp; Most of us have one or two methods of learning that seem to work best, and we have to work harder to learn in the other ways.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">If you prefer to listen to lectures, participate in discussions, hear recordings, and generally feel that you learn best by&nbsp; hearing things, your strongest learning style is likely to be auditory.&nbsp; If you are a student who likes to move around, try things out, experiment, go on field trips, and so forth, then it is likely that you have a kinesthetic learning style.&nbsp; Do you like pictures, diagrams, reading, or visual aids?&nbsp; You are probably a strongly visual learner.&nbsp; If you know your learning style, you can seek out experiences that best match it and that will help you learn most efficiently.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>What if you have not yet discovered your learning style?&nbsp; That’s not a difficult problem, either.&nbsp; I’ve included links to surveys that are designed to help you figure it out.&nbsp; Try them out and learn about yourself!</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Many people find that they have a mix of learning styles.&nbsp; That’s a real blessing, because it allows you to learn efficiently from many types of teaching.&nbsp; Information that is presented in classroom settings is often a mix of lecture and textbook format.&nbsp; A few classes offer a bit of&nbsp; hands-on experience, such as lab experiments, but that is less common.&nbsp; Your learning style will affect which of the teaching styles seem best for you.&nbsp; You will probably find that it is easier to learn in some ways than in others.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Graphic organizers are generally good tools for people who have a visual learning style, and to a lesser extent, a kinesthetic learning style.&nbsp; You can see in the root word “graph” that graphic organizers have something to do with seeing things.&nbsp; The Greek root word means “to write.”&nbsp; Graphic organizers are visual representations of the connections between and structure of information.&nbsp; They show you a clear picture of how the bits of information can be structured to make a cohesive whole.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">There are many, many types of graphic organizers.&nbsp; Some are more common than others.&nbsp; Nearly everyone is familiar with a timeline, for example.&nbsp; This is perhaps the most common form of graphic organizer.&nbsp; Information is presented in chronological order, and it is shown on a line.&nbsp; You could easily present the same information in paragraph form, but a timeline is often more clear and easier to understand quickly.&nbsp; You can see at a glance how the information is related together, and for this reason, timelines are very popular tools when students need to learn chronological information.&nbsp; Timelines are common fixtures in history classes, and are also used whenever past events are being studied.&nbsp; It’s possible to create timelines for nearly any set of events that happen over time, including science experiments or personal lives.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Another common graphic organizer is the circle chart that is often used to depict cyclical sets of events.&nbsp; One example of this is the water cycle chart.&nbsp; Arrows guide your eye from one part of the organizer to the next and after several steps, you arrive back at the symbol you started with.&nbsp; The water cycle chart usually consists of four sections, including clouds, rain, groundwater, and evaporation.&nbsp; The arrows show the direction that the water moves (from clouds down to the earth as rain, and back up to the clouds as water evaporates).&nbsp; This chart is simple to remember and to draw, and is commonly used in science classes for this reason.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>A newer type of graphic organizer is the web.&nbsp; Students who have been in school in the last fifteen or twenty years are likely to be familiar with this type of organizer, but it can baffle parents and grandparents.&nbsp; The web organizer has a central figure (a circle or a square), other figures scattered around the page, and all are connected by various lines.&nbsp; The purpose of a web organizer is to show, like an outline, the relative importance of different pieces of information.&nbsp; Unlike an outline, however, the web also shows the relationships between bits of information that are not necessarily under the same main points.&nbsp; For example, a web diagram may show information about a book or story.&nbsp; The central idea might be the theme or the problem of the story.&nbsp; The outlying ideas may be characters who are interacting and affecting one another.&nbsp; The lines show connections between the characters and the central idea and also between characters and other characters.&nbsp; So characters who are married may have a line connecting them to each other and also a line connecting each of them back to the main idea.&nbsp; These lines can be labeled to show exactly what the connection is.&nbsp; The web organizer can pack a lot of information into a very small space and can show interconnectedness that a traditional outline cannot.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Another type of graphic organizer is a chart.&nbsp; You’ve used these before, I’m sure.&nbsp; Charts generally depict categories of information and what fits into each.&nbsp; If you were to make a chart about trees, you might have many types of trees and show on the chart which are deciduous or coniferous, which are broadleaf and which are not, which grow in specific regions of the country, which are tall and which are short, and much more.&nbsp; You can design your chart to suit the needs of the moment.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Venn Diagrams are another kind of graphic organizer that you are likely to be familiar with.&nbsp; Venn Diagrams consist of two or more overlapping circles.&nbsp; Each circle represents a concept or an item that is to be compared to the others.&nbsp; The area of overlap is where commonalities are listed.&nbsp; The area of each circle that is not in the overlapping area is where information specific to each concept goes.&nbsp; The diagram gives you a clear picture of how much the things have in common.&nbsp; Venn Diagrams are useful for comparing stories, events, and so forth.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Of course, these are just a few of the many examples of graphic organizers.&nbsp; Organizers can be created to suit nearly any type of information, and they don’t have to look like any other organizer ever created.&nbsp; The organizer can be created to suit the information that needs to be organized!&nbsp; In general, though, there are four main types of organizers.&nbsp; Organizers can fan outward from a central figure, and show relationships, importance, and connections between bits of information.&nbsp; Organizers can be linear, showing the order of the information.&nbsp; Organizers can be circular, depicting a series of events that repeats again and again, and organizers can be hierarchical in nature, showing relative importance of information, much like an outline.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Now that you know what they are and have some idea of the many forms they can take, you are probably wondering how graphic organizers can be used by students as a tool to further learning.&nbsp; The answer is that organizers can be incredibly versatile tools and can be used in many ways.&nbsp; They are useful ways for adults to gather information about what a student has learned and understands about a topic (as an assessment), and they can be used for planning by students.&nbsp; Graphic organizers can serve as structural guides for writing papers and speeches, for designing book reports, and for guiding discussions.&nbsp; For the purposes of this class, however, we will take a close look at using graphic organizers to help you take notes from lectures or text passages.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">If you feel that graphic organizers can help you to learn more efficiently and keep track of information better, it’s perfectly all right to use them to organize your notes.&nbsp; You can make a blank organizer or use a template such as the ones available through the links section of this class.&nbsp; Fill in the different portions of the organizer as you read or listen to the lecture, much as you can fill in the points of an outline as the information is presented.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The toughest part of the process is to figure out what sort of organizer will be most appropriate and helpful for the information that you need to learn.&nbsp; Remember the four types of organizers discussed earlier?&nbsp; Fan, linear, circular, or hierarchical organizers all have different purposes.&nbsp; You’ll need to preview the information that you will be discussing or reading about to choose the best tool for the job.&nbsp; If you are studying history, for example, you’ll need a linear organizer (a timeline) if the information contains a lot of dates.&nbsp; You might need a hierarchical organizer, like a chart, if you are learning about commonalities of events.&nbsp; A Venn Diagram will help you if you are comparing and contrasting events or circumstances.&nbsp; Will the teacher or text be discussing the reasons for a war?&nbsp; Try a fan organizer.&nbsp; Put the central idea in the middle, and the main reasons around it.&nbsp; Connect details that are related to the various reasons for the war and show how one detail may have caused another.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It’s also possible that your teacher may be able to tell you which type of organizer would be most helpful for a given topic.&nbsp; The most important thing, though, is practice.&nbsp; Like any other skill, the more you use it, the better you become at using it.&nbsp; Graphic organizers are tools.&nbsp; They can help you to learn and remember information more efficiently and completely.&nbsp; Understanding how to use these tools will help you to take advantage of the opportunity that they present.</FONT>
