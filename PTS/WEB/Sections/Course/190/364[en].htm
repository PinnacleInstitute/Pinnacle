<FONT face=Arial size=2>A printed product or job must be well planned. The combination of ideas used in planning and designing the product is called a layout. It can be defined as the arrangement of all the units or elements into a printed, usable format. These units or elements include the heading, sub-heading, text matter, illustrations, and photographs. The preparation of a complete set of layouts will require: thumbnail sketches, rough layout, and a comprehensive layout. A definite plan, predetermined, is very necessary. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Before we even get to that point, though, we need to analyze the work that professionals are producing - and contrasting these works with those of previous works helps us gain a full understanding of how the concept of art changes with the trends of consumers. Many of the process pieces we're going to use in analyzing current and historical magazines will apply directly to our next lesson, "Blocking a Layout", but are defined differently.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=2><FONT face=Arial><B>Values of good planning</B> 
<BR>Graphic planning allows the designer to review and revise his or her thoughts. Printed work is often completed in less time and each person who performs a mechanical function leading to the final product knows their job. Questions are kept to a minimum. </FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Spelling, wording, and the placement of material must be accurate, otherwise the final product will have little value. The specifications of the client for their printed material must be accurately met. This will result in a high-quality final product and the client, commercial printing plant management, and the skilled workers will be satisfied that their work has fulfilled a particular requirement. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>So, each of these requirements should be met in the professional works that we view, right? Look closely at the examples we use - there is always room for human error, and you might be surprised at just how much human error affects the works that are on our newsstands right now.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>The Analyzation Process</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>All good, professional designers use some type of a pre-layout planning form. This form helps them formulate ideas that will be turned into a printed job. Some of the questions used in the pre-layout planning form (which we'll use ourselves in the next lesson) are applicable to the analyzation process. In addition, to analyze the current works, we're going to take a look at a few other questions. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Copy-Paste the following form into Notepad or a similar word processing program on your computer, or write them down real fast. Then, using the form, study each of the magazine covers that follow. You will be using knowledge that you've gained in the previous lessons of this course, and formulating specific ideas on what a good layout means to you. Jot down the answers to each question for reference later on.</FONT>

<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Objective of the product. </I>What is the purpose of the finished product? Is it to sell? Inform? Reference? </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Target group.</I> Will the printed material be for personal use, for scientists, for teenagers, or for some other group? The design approach would be different for each- how, exactly, did you decide what target group it is for? Keep in mind the psychology of colors. </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Personality of the product.</I>&nbsp;Is the cover&nbsp;sophisticated, gaudy, dignified, humorous, or have some other quality? The type of paper (which we can't really judge digitally), typography, and images combined with color combinations set a specific mood. Does this mood support the target group this magazine is trying to reach?&nbsp;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Style of the finished product.</I> Based on the cover, make some guesses. Does this finished product contain photographs, or be strictly printed with text? Will it contain cartoons, illustrations, or a combination of both?</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Layout format. </I>Again, this requires some guess work. Obviously, these are covers for magazines. However, the cover of the magazine should tell the reader what kind of layout the magazine contains - how many advertisements will the magazine include? What is the tone that each page will set? Will the pages be more text or more image? </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Recommended Changes. </I>If you were assigned as an artist to this magazine, what changes would you make to the cover? Based on the knowledge we've gained about color theory and the use of space, how can this magazine make a stronger impact?</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=Arial size=2><I>Personal Thoughts. </I>Our final project is the creation of our own magazine cover, using our own photography. If you were to use this magazine cover as your "template", which images would you use? What kind of text would you use? Would this product be appropriate for your audience (ex. if you wanted to give this cover as a gift to your neice)? </FONT>
