<B>What is color theory?</B> 
<P>Color Theory is a set of principles used to create harmonious color combinations. Color relationships can be visually represented with a color wheel — the color spectrum wrapped onto a circle. A full representation of all the information would fill several encyclopedias; if you get into color theory, you will have a lot of space to cover and enjoy. 
<P>The importance of color theory is integral to anyone who wants to create great photography. Color is the very canvas that a photograph is painted from - the music our eyes get to enjoy. These same colors affect our psychology and - <I>literally</I> - set the mood of what we view. The collection of images below illustrate this idea - the same scene is reflected at different times of day, through the use of color. How does each successive change affect your perception of the image?

<P><B>History of color theory</B> 
<P>The first color wheel was invented by Sir Isaac Newton. He split white sunlight into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, and blue beams; then he joined the two ends of the color spectrum together to show the natural progression of colors. Newton associated each color with a separate note&nbsp;on a musical scale. 
<P>A century after Sir Newton, Johann Wolfgang Goethe began studying the&nbsp;psychological effect of colors. He noticed that blue gives a feeling of coolness and yellow has a warming effect. Goethe created a color wheel showing the psychological effect of each color. He divided all the colors into two groups – the plus side (from red through orange to yellow) and the minus side (from green through violet to blue). Colors of the plus side produce excitement and cheerfulness. Colors of the minus side are associated with weakness and unsettled feelings. 
<P>The current form of color theory was developed by Johannes Itten, a Swiss color and art theorist who was teaching at the School of Applied Arts in Weimar, Germany. This school is also known as 'Bauhaus'. Johannes Itten developed 'color chords' and modified the color wheel. Itten's color wheel is based on red, yellow, and blue colors as the primary triad and includes twelve hues.

<P><B>The color wheel</B> 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 221px; HEIGHT: 221px" alt=color_wheel.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/color_wheel.gif" border=0> 
<P>This very important and sometimes intimidating device is essential to designers and artists alike. 
<P>The color wheel is made up of 12 basic hues. 3 Primary 3 Secondary (Mixture of 2 primaries) 6 Tertiary (Mixture of a primary and a secondary) 
<P>Primary Hues: Blue, Red, Yellow (In the printing world these colors are Cyan, Magenta, and&nbsp;Yellow) 
<P>Secondary Hues: Violet, Green, Orange 
<P>Tertiary Hues: Red-Violet, Yellow-Orange, Blue-Green, Red-Orange, Blue-Violet, Yellow-Green 
<P>Some Color Terminology: 
<P>Hue: The term hue is used to describe any pure color, with the exception of Black or White. 
<P>Chroma/Chromaticity: The chromaticity of a color is its saturation or intensity. For example if we are using an RGB palette a high chromaticity blue might be 0,0,255 or Red has a higher chromaticity than pink. 
<P>Value: The value of a color is its 'lightness' or 'brightness'. Now it might seem that chroma and value are the same thing but they are not. For example, if you take two high chroma colors like Blue and Yellow, Yellow has the higher value than blue because its 'brighter'. 
<P>Tone: A tone is any hue mixed with a grey (grey is a neutral of black and white) 
<P>Tint: A Tint is a hue mixed with white. 
<P>Shade: A shade is a hue mixed with black. 
<P>Complimentary Color: The color that is on th exact opposite side of the color wheel of one color. A neutral color is created when you mix these two colors together.
