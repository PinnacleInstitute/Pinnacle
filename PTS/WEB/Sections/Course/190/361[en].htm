The Photoshop for Photographers courses work together to create a whole understanding of ways to enhance your photography with the use of Photoshop. We work at a basic level that is suitable for the beginner to intermediate Photoshop user - your level of photography skill has no bearing on your ability to successfully complete this and/or the successive courses in this series. I do, however, recommend following the series in order. One course's concepts build upon the previous lessons learned, and this can be frustrating if you skip the order. 
<P>In this first course of the series, we focus on Color Theory, The Concept of Space, Analyzing the Professionals, Blocking a Layout, and Filling In The Pieces. Our final, ultimate goal within this course is the creation of a magazine cover that features your photography - of the highest quality, and creative enough to make the magazine industry turn green with envy. 
<P>A detailed summary of each lesson within this course follows.

<P align=left><B>Color Theory:</B> Within this lesson, we'll learn the basic concepts of how colors work together based on their position on a color wheel and - more importantly - how the use of color affects the psychology of a finished piece. This is by no means a complete overview of color theory. The study of color theory is a course within itself - and then some. What we're going to focus on is becoming acquainted with the successful use of color, and how the colors we choose - from the image to the text - helps us create a stunning magazine cover. 
<P align=left><B>The Concept of Space:</B> Visually, there's very little originality in design - it's more a process of reorganizing something previously observed, a conception of viewpoints on a layout previously recorded, a new way of viewing an item already known. No matter how simple the layout, though, the use of space and layout is important. A strong understanding of the concept will help you to begin judging layouts, and incorporating these ideas into your art and photography.
<P align=left><B>Analyzing the Professionals: </B>As a beginner, we start by analyzing the content which is out there already. The reasons for this are many; even professional artists find success in studying the popular material of the moment. As trends change, images and the concept of what popular art is, changes. We want to create a magazine cover that is visually attractive, that highlights our photography, and which can be proudly displayed to showcase our skills. The first logical step, after gaining the background we have learned thus far in the course, is to study what kind of magazine covers are popular right now. 
<P align=left><B>Blocking a Layout: </B>Photoshop has all sorts of wonderful tools that help us along the way in creating our beautiful magazine cover. If we take the time to first sort which color combinations and space usage we will utilize, we're one step closer to a very professional cover. 
<P align=left><B>Filling In The Pieces: </B>Using an actual magazine as our guide, or creating something new and cool all on our own, the only step left in our masterpiece is the plugging in of all images and text using the blocked layout we just created. And... wa-la! In one day, you've gained an understanding of colors, space, and Photoshop that would take several months in college.
