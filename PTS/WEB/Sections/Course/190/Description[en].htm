<P><B>Course Goals</B> 
<P>The Photoshop for Photographers courses&nbsp;will help you make the most of your Photography within Photoshop. 
<P>In Course 1, we're going to learn how to create very cool, professional-quality "magazine covers" using your digital photos. These make great framed gifts. If you've ever wanted to be on the cover of the Rolling Stone, but aren't in a band, you can do it now- put your son on the cover of Sports Illustrated, or your daughter on Vogue, the possibilities are endless. We'll be working with the real thing - and ending up with something the magazine industry just might envy. 
<P>More than the magazine cover which we'll end with as our final project, you'll be familiarizing yourself with Color Theory, Artistic Space, Typography, and tools native to Photoshop. Written in a format which is suitable for the beginning Photoshop user, there are more than enough techniques and concepts for the intermediate and advanced user as well. Your photography skills do not&nbsp;count in successful completion of this course.
<P><B>Course Materials</B> 
<P>The only materials you need to provide on your own is a collection of 7-10 digital photos that you want to work with. All other materials will be provided. 
<P><B>Grading Policy</B>
