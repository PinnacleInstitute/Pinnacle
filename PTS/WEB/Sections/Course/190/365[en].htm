<FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>Pre-layout planning</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>We touched on this in our last lesson. As we learned, a pre-layout planning form should be completed to help formulate the ideas of the person who is creating the layout. Each of the&nbsp;8 questions that follow should be recorded for reference during the layout preparation. These are really just personal versions of the Analying Questions we answered previously. Many of the answers you formulated during analyzation directly apply to these questions, and looking back to them as you answer these will help speed the process along.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Copy-paste the following questions into Notepad or a similar word processing program, or jot them down on a piece of paper. As you answer the questions, look back to the analyzing questions you just completed and keep in mind that these questions are going to guide you in your final project - what you answer here should be answered to help you make the magazine cover layout easier.</FONT>

<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Objective of the product. </I>Why are you creating this magazine cover? Is it a gift? A piece for your portfolio? Just for fun?</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Target group.</I> This is determined by your objective - if this is a gift, who is it for? For your portfolio, what type of people are most likely to view the cover?</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Personality of the product.</I> What sort of mood should your cover set? Should it be sophisticated, humorous, loving, or something else? The type of paper you will finally print on, the type of text you choose, and the image(s) that you place on the cover will depend on this decision.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Style of the finished product.</I> How many photographs should the cover contain? Will you use a lot of text, or just a few pieces to convey the feeling of a magazine cover? Are there going to be pieces of art - illustrations or cartoons - along with your photograph(s)?</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Layout format. </I>Based on the analyzing that you've done, and the concept of space principles, what sort of placement should your image(s) and text(s) be put in?</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Approximate dimensions. </I>What will be the printed size of your magazine cover? If the cover is going to be framed, you will want to stick to sizes that can be placed under a matte and framed without cutting off the image. For a portfolio, you need to consider the effect that the size of the image will have upon your portfolio. Any way that you go, this decision will affect what size of canvas and paper you choose.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Color Choices.</I> What color harmonies are you going to focus on? You can go from something as simple as black and white to as bright as you want to go - but remember the color psychology, and tie your colors in to every answer you have formulated up to this point.</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><I>Originality.</I> Are you going to base your magazine cover on a "real" magazine, or are you going to create your own? If you're going to base it on a magazine, which one? If you're doing your own, are there any magazines that you would like to emulate and/or use elements of? This step might require some research. Google for magazine publishers and study magazine covers, or take a visit to your local library and jot down some sketches and ideas.</FONT>

<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>Layout Procedure 
<BR></B>The sequence followed for preparing graphic layout materials is drawing thumbnail sketches, rough layout, and comprehensive layout. Several <I>thumbnail sketches</I> are usually prepared. The selection is made by the person who is ordering the product. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In this case, you are not only the designer but the person "ordering" the project as well. Because of this, I had considered leaving out the procedure and jumping right into blocking the layout using Photoshop. However, I decided to show how the traditional layout procedure process, which is generally completed in pencil, can be done more quickly using Photoshop. So, here we go.</FONT> 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 259px; HEIGHT: 138px" height=138 alt=layseq.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/layseq.gif" width=259 align=middle border=0> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>The <I>rough layout</I> is made up of the thumbnail sketch chosen. This layout is generally the same size as the final product and contains all of the copy and illustrations. Alterations can be easily made between the thumbnail sketch to the rough layout, and again between the rough and the comprehensive layout. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>The <I>comprehensive layout</I> is based upon the general arrangements of the thumbnail sketch and the rough layout. This is a precision layout which permits the customer to see what the final product will look like.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Because we're completing the work in Photoshop, the rough layout is&nbsp;the same quality as the comprehensive layout. For this reason, although we'll cover what a comprehensive layout is, we won't be using it - we can completely skip this step.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>This lesson should be read - and completed - in the order that you read it, as you read it. It is the longest lesson in this course,&nbsp;and provides the most "meat".</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>Thumbnail Sketches 
<BR></B>Thumbnail sketches are simple idea sketches which will help you, the designer, to obtain an attractive and acceptable final result. This step allows you to try out several ideas and then choose the one you like best.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Thumbnail sketches serve these three primary purposes; they: </FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Graphically preserve ideas; </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Visually portray ideas; and </FONT>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Compare two or more ideas visually.</FONT>
</OL>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Preparation of these sketches should begin immediately after the desired product has been selected and after completion of the pre-layout planning sheet. You should already have all ove the images you are considering to use, so that you can place them right onto the thumbnail sketch.</FONT> 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 233px; HEIGHT: 284px" height=284 alt=thumb.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/thumb.gif" width=233 align=middle border=0> 
<P align=left><B><I>Thumbnail Sketches in Photoshop</I></B> 
<P align=left><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Right, so it's easy enough to scribble something down on a piece of paper. It might surprise you to know that it's actually <I>easier</I> to place out ideas on a canvas in Photoshop. Step-by-step, here's the process.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open all of the images that you think you're going to use in Photoshop. To open them, you have two options: (1) Click "File, Open" and navigate to the image. Click OK. (2) Open the folder that your images are in. Then, click and drag the image right into Photoshop. It will open automatically.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Open a new canvas. Click "File, New" and set the canvas size at 300 x 300 pixels. Make the background white.</FONT> All other options should be left at their default. 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Locate the rectangle tool in the Photoshop palette and click it once. </FONT>
<P align=center><IMG alt=ill1.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill1.gif" align=baseline border=0> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Using the rectangle tool, draw a cross on your canvas. When you draw one rectangle, click "Layer" and choose "Rasterize Layer". Do this for each rectangle.</FONT> When done, each separate piece of your canvas will represent a different thumbnail. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 130px; HEIGHT: 138px" height=150 alt=ill2.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill2.gif" width=152 align=baseline border=0> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Go to the images that you opened. One at a time, click "Select" and choose "Select All". Then click "Edit" and choose "Copy". Finally, go back to your new canvas with the cross on it, and choose "Edit" and click "Paste". The image will be much larger than the canvas. You will need to click "Edit" and choose "Free Transform". Using the resize handles (the open squares at each corner of the image), make the image smaller, so that it fits into one of the pages on your canvas. </FONT>
<P align=center><FONT face=Arial size=2><IMG style="WIDTH: 152px; HEIGHT: 161px" height=197 alt=ill3.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill3.gif" width=194 align=baseline border=0></FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Continue this Copy-Paste process until you have arranged the images you want to use on each page of your canvas, representing four different layout ideas that you have.</FONT> 
<P align=center><IMG alt=ill4.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill4.gif" align=baseline border=0> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Finally, click the large "T" on your Photoshop palette. Then, click on your canvas where you want text to appear, and indicate the magazine name and where headlines should be placed within each of your four ideas.</FONT> 
<P align=center><IMG alt=ill5.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill5.gif" align=baseline border=0> 
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. What's next? Well, save your image. Click "File" and choose "Save As". Select the spot you want to save your thumbnails to, probably "My Pictures", and then click "Save". </FONT>
<P align=left><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Now... pick the thumbnail that you think is going to represent your goals and target audience best. Below is the thumbnail I chose.</FONT> 
<P align=center><IMG alt=ill6.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill6.gif" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp; 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>It is important to compose several thumbnail ideas that you can make your final selection from. Skilled designers prepare at least four thumbnails for any job given to them. Don't be afraid to&nbsp;compile&nbsp;more of them - prepare as many thumbnail sketches as you have ideas. It is most difficult for us, as beginners, to visualize the large number of possibilities without putting them down.&nbsp;</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>Rough Layout 
<BR></B>The second major step in any layout procedure involves the preparation of a rough layout. This layout is an improvement or refinement of a thumbnail sketch, or even a combination of two or more of these. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>The purposes of a rough layout are:</FONT> 
<OL>
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Force a selection of one of the several thumbnail ideas;</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Begin refining a specific idea; and</FONT> 
<LI><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Provide a tangible item that can be studied and changed.</FONT>
</OL>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Actually, a rough layout can be considered a pre-final product. Therefore, in many cases, it can be used as the basis for the final product without the need to produce a comprehensive layout.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>In other words, we're going to learn how to do both the rough layout <I>and</I> learn more about the comprehensive layout, but we're going to skip the comprehensive layout altogether.</FONT> 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 232px; HEIGHT: 176px" height=176 alt=rough.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/rough.gif" width=232 align=middle border=0> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B><I>Rough Layout in Photoshop:</I></B></FONT> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>The rough layout is going to be the next-best-thing to your final piece. Step-by-step, here's how we'll do it:</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open a new canvas (File, New). Leave the basic options at their default, just making sure that the background is white. Then,&nbsp;look back at your pre-layout worksheet. Set the size of your canvas to the size of the finished magazine cover that you want to create.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Using your thumbnail as a guide,&nbsp;"draw" the sections of your magazine cover using the Rectangle tool. The colors of each rectangle should represent the color palette that you've chosen, based on color psychology. Don't panic - just take a breath... it probably seems like I'm asking a lot here, but think about it; you know this stuff. </FONT>
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 244px; HEIGHT: 291px" height=351 alt=ill7.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill7.gif" width=252 align=baseline border=0> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;Don't worry about what text you're going to place, yet, and don't worry about the exact images. What you want to do, instead, is place photos&nbsp;that you think you'll use, where you think you'll use them. Again, this is pretty easy - you've already&nbsp;got your thumbnail picked out, use it as your guide.&nbsp;Once your images are placed approximately, type a few nonsense sentences where&nbsp;they seem to fit.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. That's all there is to the Rough Layout. Save the image (File, Save As), and take a deep breath - you're doing an awesome amount of work here, be proud of yourself! Below is&nbsp;my Rough Layout, sized down considerably.</FONT>&nbsp; 
<P align=center><IMG alt=ill8.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/ill8.gif" align=baseline border=0> 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>Comprehensive Layout 
<BR></B>The comprehensive layout is considered&nbsp;the most important step in the production of a printed work, when working traditionally using pencil and/or pen and paper. It is the master plan or blue-print of the finished product. It allows the designer and the client to see the finished product and to make changes if necessary.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>Because of the nature of Photoshop, the only piece of the Comprehensive Layout you need to be concerned with is the preparation of text. Take a few minutes to study the rough draft, and relate it to your goals and target audience. Have you chosen the best possible colors?&nbsp;Do your images support each other?&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>After the designer and the client have made all the necessary decisions, the comprehensive layout will contain all of the information needed to guide the preparation of the final product. </FONT>
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 185px; HEIGHT: 275px" height=275 alt=compreh.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/compreh.gif" width=185 align=middle border=0>&nbsp;
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2>When you've come to this point, save your work one final time. Take a break, a deep breath, and get ready to finish the magazine cover off.</FONT>
