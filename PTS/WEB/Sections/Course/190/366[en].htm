<B>Why worry about Type?</B> 
<P><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>We've gotten so far - we've studied color theory, the use of space, and know how to integrate a lot of concepts into use with Photoshop. So why should we cram another thing in?</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The type of text we use, the font or type face, is the final determining factor in how successful your magazine cover will be. Can you imagine TIME magazine, for example, if it used fancy script lettering for its name? It wouldn't convey the same feeling, would it?</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>So, have some patience here and take a few minutes to learn about Typography. It's the final building block in this course, and one which can really make your magazine cover worth the effort you've expended.</FONT>

<BR><B>Type Terms</B> 
<BR>A type face may be named for its original designer (Baskerville, Bodoni, Garamond, Goudy); for its use (Times Roman was designed for the <I>London Times</I>; Century and Avant Garde were designed for <I>Century</I> and <I>Avant Garde</I> magazines); for its characteristics (Excelsior and Paragon were designed for high legibility); or for its designer's fancy (Perpetua, Souvenir, Centaur). 
<P>Type faces are also given generic names as well as brand names, e.g. different type-founder's call Times Roman different names, e.g. Times New Roman, Geneva, and English. 
<P>To identify type or recognise a wrong font, you must know what the variables are, because differences amongst the thousands of type faces available today can be minute. Since an untrained eye cannot distinguish even gross differences, you should become familiar with the fundamental features of type that are labelled in the following diagram:

<P><B>Type Categories</B> 
<BR>All type faces that are to be used in the appropriate print media must be purchased under a number of specific criteria. It is important to know whether a favoured type design has the necessary flexibility to be used for a wide range of design and publication needs. 
<P><B>Font</B> 
<BR>Many of the more popular type faces used today are available in three different alternatives: <I>Commercial font</I>, <I>Expert font</I> and <I>Pi font</I>. 
<P>A<I> Commercial</I> type font contains the usual range of characters that are needed for most forms of typesetting, i.e. one complete assortment of alphabet letters comprised of capitals and lower case, numerals, punctuation, special characters, and symbols. 
<P>A type font is only available in one specific type face design. Therefore, a type face such as 10-pt Times Roman is considered to be <I>one</I> font and 10-pt Times Bold is <I>another</I>.

<BR><SMALL><B>Commercial font </B></SMALL>
<P>In Desktop Publishing, extra care must be taken when working across two or more platforms because certain characters from the <I>same font and type foundry</I>, accessible on the PC platform, are not available to the AppleMac. 
<P>Currently, <I>Expert fonts</I> are limited to those fonts which are the most popular type faces. These fonts contain special characters such as `ligatures', `small caps' and `swash' letters that are not normally used, or needed, in the everyday world of commercial typesetting. For certain classes of bookwork and high-class typesetting purposes, their inclusion forms an invaluable addition to the finished result.

<BR><SMALL><B>Swash Character Font </B></SMALL>
<P><I>Pi fonts</I> usually contain a collection of special characters such as mathematical, monetary or decorative symbols, etc. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 434px; HEIGHT: 226px" height=226 alt=pifnt.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/pifnt.gif" width=434 align=middle border=0> 
<BR><SMALL><B>Pi Font — Zapf Dingbats </B></SMALL>
<P>If you have a special need for certain characters, most manufacturers will make a pi font to fit your need using standard characters or even develop new one to suit you.<I> Symbol</I>, <I>Carta</I>, and <I>Zapf Dingbats</I> are examples of common pi fonts. 
<P><B>Series</B> 
<BR>Irrespective of the style of font you use, if the design is readily available in a range of sizes, e.g. 10-, 12-, 14-, 18-pt, etc. and has the same name, then it is regarded as being a <I>series</I>. 
<P><FONT face=arial,helvetica,geneva size=2><B>Family</B> 
<BR>The last variable in the flexibility (and popularity) of a type face design is whether or not the design has a range of variants. If a number of fonts have the same name and general characteristics of face, e.g. Times Roman, Times Bold, Times Roman Italic, etc. then they are known as a <I>Family</I>. </FONT>
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 166px; HEIGHT: 160px" height=160 alt=typefce.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/typefce.gif" width=166 align=middle border=0> 
<BR><SMALL><B>Font Family</B></SMALL> 
<P>The majority of fonts in common use have at least four variants, i.e. normal, italic, bold, and bold italic. The popular type design used above (Helvetica), has a family of over 50 varients, whereas many decorative and script style fonts such as Algerian, Arnold Boecklin Giddyup and Pepita, do not have a range of different variations and are usually restricted to a single font. 
<P>When nominating a type face, the order of description can be thus: 
<UL>
<LI>Type Size: <B>10 point</B> 
<LI>Type Body: <B>12 point</B> 
<LI>Type Family: <B>Helvetica</B>

<BR><B>Justification 
<BR></B>Typing or setting text lines to the same length so that they line up on the left <I>and </I>the right is known as `justification'. The information that you are now reading has been typeset using this method. The practice originated with Mediaeval scribes who ruled margins and text lines so as to speed writing and fit as many characters on a line as possible. 
<P>Later, metal type required even copy blocks to allow `lock up' into page form. (The opposite of justified text is ragged text.) 
<P>Justification is the result of setting ragged lines and sharing any end-of-line space equally between the words in that line. Hence, in justified setting the word spaces width varies from line-to-line. 
<P>All page assembly and drawing programs have an options dialogue box(es) to enable typesetters to have precise control of the variables impacting on justification. The major dialogue box options related to justification allow adjustments to hyphenation and spacebands (word spaces). 
<P><B>Space between lines 
<BR></B>To improve the ease with which text can be read, i.e., legibility, the amount of extra space placed between each line in a setting must be varied according to the line length and character of the type face being used. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 480px; HEIGHT: 319px" height=319 alt=linespce.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/linespce.gif" width=480 align=middle border=0>&nbsp; 
<P><B>Space between words 
<BR></B>To further improve on legibility, word spacing can also be controlled, but again too much or too little space can affect the ease with which the paragraph can be read. As you might expect, word spacing is affected by the style of type face chosen together with the particular situation for its use. Condensed type faces do not require as much space as expanded faces, and small type sizes read better with a little extra word spacing. As a general guide, the ideal word space represents the width of the lower case 'e' in the type face being used. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 298px; HEIGHT: 237px" height=237 alt=wrd-spce.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/wrd-spce.gif" width=298 align=middle border=0>&nbsp; 
<P><B>Space between groups 
<BR></B>In display composition, correct spacing between groups can affect the appearance and readability of type matter. In this situation, the wishes of the person designing the job will govern the amount of space to be used. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 381px; HEIGHT: 366px" height=366 alt=variety.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/variety.gif" width=381 align=middle border=0>&nbsp;. 
<P>Space is used to separate one thought or section of copy from another, therefore the amount of space should be varied according to how isolated one thought is from another.

<P><B>Vertical setting of lines 
<BR></B>Occasionally, display lines are set vertically. If it is appropriate to treat an unimportant line or lines in this way (important lines should not be treated so) it makes for easier comprehension and a much cleaner and therefore stronger pattern if the line is set normally and then placed on one or other of its ends and not set with the letters the right way up, and one below the other, e.g. Hotel signs.

<P><B>Type arrangement 
<BR></B>There are five basic ways that lines of type can be arranged for a given piece of composition they are: Justified, Range Left, Centered, Range Right, and Asymmetrical. 
<P><B><I>Justified</I></B> 
<BR>Justified is the most familiar method of type arrangement, especially for books, magazines, and newspapers. The lines of type are kept all the same length so that the lines are flush left and right. In order to make the lines equal, the word spacing is adjusted so that each line fills the entire measure. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 329px; HEIGHT: 81px" height=81 alt=justify.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/justify.gif" width=329 align=middle border=0> 
<BR><SMALL><B>Justified setting </B></SMALL>
<P><I>Advantages</I> 
<UL>
<LI>This arrangement is best suited for sustained reading comfort. 
<LI>The pages assume a quiet look and do not distract the reader. 
<LI>It allows the reader to concentrate on the content rather than the design. 
</UL>
<P><I>Disadvantages</I> 
<UL>
<LI>If the line measure is too narrow there could be a risk of poor word spacing. 
<LI>Words may be poorly hyphenated at the end of lines. 
</UL>
<P><I><B>Range Left</B></I> 
<BR>This arrangement is the second most widely used method for composition; most poetry and typewritten copy appears this way. The type is set with even word spacing and each of the lines will vary in length. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 322px; HEIGHT: 98px" height=98 alt=justleft.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/justleft.gif" width=322 align=middle border=0> 
<BR><SMALL><B>Align left setting </B></SMALL>
<P><I>Advantages</I> 
<UL>
<LI>The even word spacing creates a uniform overall texture. 
<LI>It is ideal for setting type in narrow columns. 
<LI>Hyphenation of words is at a minimum. 
<LI>The risk of <I>rivers of white</I> flowing down the page is eliminated. 
<LI>Lines can run either long or short, hyphenated words are virtually unnecessary. 
<LI>The ragged edge of the right adds visual interest to the page. 
</UL>
<P><I>Disadvantages</I> 
<UL>
<LI>If lines are set the same approximate length it can be a disturbing factor in the design. 
<LI>It is important that the ragged edge should create a pleasing silhouette, convex rather than concave. 
</UL>
<P><I><B>Centered</B></I> 
<BR>In this arrangement, the lines of type are centered on the page. When using centered type the length of the lines must be varied enough to create an interesting silhouette. To control the shape, a minimum and maximum line length should be indicated. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 314px; HEIGHT: 99px" height=99 alt=justcntr.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/justcntr.gif" width=314 align=middle border=0>

<LI>Reading centered lines is tiring, therefore it is better suited to smallamounts of copy. 
</UL>
<P><I><B>Range Right</B></I> 
<BR>In this instance the lines are aligned at the right so that the left side is ragged. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 319px; HEIGHT: 100px" height=100 alt=justrght.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/justrght.gif" width=319 align=middle border=0>

<LI>Since this form of type arrangement is infrequently used, it can create an interesting layout. 
<LI>The even word spacing creates a uniform overall texture. 
<LI>Ideal for setting type in narrow columns. 
<LI>Hyphenation of words is reduced to a minimum. 
</UL>
<P><I>Disadvantages</I> 
<UL>
<LI>Visually, it is an interesting layout, however this setting demands more concentration on behalf of the reader. 
<LI>The reader is accustomed to reading from left to right, a ragged left edge increases reading difficulty. 
<LI>Reading lines set range right is tiring, therefore it is better suited to small amounts of copy. 
</UL>
<P><B><I>Asymmetrical</I></B> 
<BR>In this arrangement, the lines have no predictable pattern in length or placement. The simplest method of controlling this effect is to have the copy set with specified line-breaks and then arrange the lines yourself in mechanicals. There are no rules and probably no two typesetters would break the lines in the same place. 
<P align=center><IMG style="WIDTH: 205px; HEIGHT: 140px" height=140 alt=assymet.gif hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/190/assymet.gif" width=205 align=middle border=0>
