<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Stress can come from treating lightly our relationship with the Lord and making minimal effort to keep His commandments. Sometimes we go through the motions of being religious by going to church or teaching a Church lesson, but deep inside we know that we are not living in such a way so as to invite the Holy Spirit to dwell with us on a daily basis. We pray in a repetitious way. We seldom read and use the scriptures. We criticize others and get angry with them. In short, we live in a way which creates dissonance between how we are behaving and how we feel we should be behaving. This dissonance manifests itself in the form of internal stress. This is frequently a subtle stress which we can easily suppress as long as things are going okay. The true magnitude of the stress is observed, however, when we are called upon to perform a spiritual function like accepting a responsible Church position or administering to the sick. It is then that we have to examine our level of spirituality, and we often end up feeling inadequate and unworthy. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3>We all know what our spiritual thermometer reads. When we are making serious attempts to grow spiritually, we feel good and have a peace of conscience. When we are not, we generally feel agitated, defensive, critical and alienated from others. Such feelings are stressful. Peace and calmness can be restored to our soul through repenting of our wrong doings (attitudes and thoughts as well as behaviors) and by living in a more spiritual way.<SUP>2</SUP></FONT></FONT>
