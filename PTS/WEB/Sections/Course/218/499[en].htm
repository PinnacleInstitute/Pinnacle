<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>[This article has been written to provide students with a number of ways to handle the stress and pressure which come from pursuing a college education. Some of the ideas are particularly directed toward members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints although the principles behind the suggestions are applicable to any college population. The article is not intended to include an extensive list of stress management procedures, but instead, to focus on some selected methods which students have found useful in their efforts to gain more control of the stress in their lives. The consistent implementation of these methods can help make college a rewarding experience rather than one which is overwhelming.]</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Stress is a common and natural condition of our mortal existence. It arises through our daily efforts to achieve goals, relate with others, and adjust to the demands of living in an ever changing world. Since there is an "opposition in all things"<SUP>1</SUP> during our earth life, a certain amount of stress will always be with us between birth and death. Yet, we commonly view stress as undesirable and something which must be reduced or eliminated before it impairs our personal efficiency and hampers our ability to enjoy life. Another way of viewing stress is to see its positive value and capitalize on it if possible. Dr. Hans Selye calls positive stress "eustress." He states, "Our aim shouldn't be to completely avoid stress, which at any rate would be impossible, but to learn how to recognize our typical response to stress and then try to modulate our lives in accordance with it."<SUP>13</SUP> Instead of retreating from stress, we can learn how to live with it and increase our ability to meet the challenges of life.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>When we fail to see value in some of the stress in our lives, we occasionally become depressed and miserable and conclude that something is wrong with us. We usually desire immediate relief from such feelings. Elder Boyd K. Packer explains a positive way to view this condition in an address to Church leaders:
<BR></FONT><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT size=3>We live in a day when the adversary stresses on every hand the philosophy of instant gratification. We seem to demand instant everything, including instant solutions to our problems. We are indoctrinated that somehow we should always be instantly emotionally comfortable. When that is not so, some become anxious- and all too frequently seek relief from counseling, from analysis, and even from medication. It was meant to be that life would be a challenge. To suffer some anxiety, some depression, some disappointment, even some failure is normal. Teach your members that if they have a good, miserable day once in a while, or several in a row, to stand steady and face them. Things will straighten out. There is a great purpose in our struggle in life.<SUP>10</SUP></FONT></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><FONT size=3>Because everyone handles stress differently, no single program for alleviating it can be guaranteed to work. A number of suggestions are available, however, which can help in the regulation of stress. The remainder of this article includes some of those suggestions. Our challenge is to sort through them to find the ones which work best for us.</FONT></FONT>
