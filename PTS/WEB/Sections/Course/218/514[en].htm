<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>It is easy to feel angry, fearful or hopeless when we judge the events in our lives to be stressful. We commonly view a winter snow storm, an outspoken roommate, losing a game or race, getting a low grade, being refused membership in a club, or receiving a speeding ticket in negative terms. The stress produced by a negative interpretation can be reduced by interpreting the same situation in a different light. For example, we can reinterpret a stressful situation as: </FONT>
<OL type=1>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>A growth promoting event which will give us experience and understanding even though it may be difficult to deal with, </FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>A challenge where we will have a chance to experiment with our abilities and compete against the odds, </FONT>
<LI><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>A natural and normal part of our mortal life which we need to endure. </FONT>
</OL>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>We always have the choice of how we are going to interpret a situation. A blind person can interpret his physical disability as an affliction which he will resent having all his life <B>or</B> interpret it as something which enables him to better appreciate the suffering of other people. A person who receives a speeding ticket can interpret the event as upsetting and unfair since so many other drivers were also speeding <B>or</B> interpret it as a chance to reevaluate his own driving habits which could prevent a future accident. A student who has a selfish and outspoken roommate can interpret the situation of living with him as intolerable <B>or</B> interpret the situation as an experience which will prepare him for marriage since his future wife could never be more difficult to live with than his roommate. A parent can interpret his child's fussy behavior as tiring and something that needs to be curbed or interpret it as a natural behavior for a child that age and patiently try to cope with it until the child outgrows it.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Any sacrifice can be interpreted as an imposition on our time or as a chance for us to build our character and spirituality. How we interpret the stress in our environment directly affects our feelings, and in turn, influences our behavior. Negative interpretations usually produce stressful feelings and lead to avoidance or resistive behavior. Positive interpretations can produce satisfying feelings and lead to productive and growth promoting behavior.</FONT>
