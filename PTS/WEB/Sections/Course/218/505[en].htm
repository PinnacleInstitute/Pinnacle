<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>It is beneficial to create an "island of time" when we can daily engage in some uninterrupted reading, pondering, thinking and praying. This should be a time when the Spirit of the Lord can easily and quietly communicate with us as we think about our relationship with God. It is a time to think positively about ourselves. It is a time to relax so as to allow our body and spirit a chance to prepare for the tasks ahead of us the rest of the day. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The body sends signals when we need physical and emotional rest. We need to be sensitive to these cues and adjust our output accordingly. Emotional and physical resilience are closely related. Studies have shown that constant emotional stress over a period of time can bring about serious physical illnesses. When we become very fatigued, our capacity to deal with the usual tasks of life decreases and we often feel emotionally overwhelmed in dealing with the smallest of problems. A short relaxation period each day can be a valuable aid in keeping our physical and emotional reserve high.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>The Lord recognizes the importance of our body receiving the proper amount of rest. He encourages us to go to bed early and to rise early so our mind and body can be invigorated.<SUP>6</SUP> It is easy to understand why we feel a fatigued stressfulness when we choose to operate on other sleep patterns.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>Some additional ways of relaxing include having available a psycho-motor activity like whittling or knitting, visiting friends who make us feel good, reading humorous material and associating with someone who has a good sense of humor, or regularly using some flexible relaxation methods like the ones at the end of this paper. Relaxation can also be facilitated by using a commercial relaxation tape or a tape we personally make where we talk ourselves into relaxing by quoting scriptures, sayings, songs or messages which have a calming and uplifting effect upon us.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>As beneficial as relaxation is in counteracting the stressful events in our life, we need to understand when it is useful to quit a given pursuit, and when it is best to rally and increase our intensity in dealing with a situation. Examples of reducing stress by withdrawing ourselves from adversive situations would be to drop out of a class we determine is too advanced for our background, or to discontinue a relationship with someone who is uncaring and manipulative. Examples of lowering our stress level by increasing our effort toward a goal would be a vigorous attempt to improve our performance in a class by going beyond the standard requirements, or a consistent attempt to improve a friendship by showing more interest in the person and initiating fun times which could be enjoyed together.</FONT>
