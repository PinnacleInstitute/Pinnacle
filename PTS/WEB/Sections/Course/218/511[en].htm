<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>There always seems to be a number of daily items which need our attention. In our efforts to take care of these items, we frequently feel exhausted at the end of the day but seriously wonder if we have accomplished anything of significance. We all recognize that the process of daily living requires a number of short-lasting have-to-do tasks like cleaning, washing clothes, and meal preparation. If our day is totally consumed with these tasks, however, a slowly developing stress reaction is likely to result. It can begin with our always feeling tired and bored with what we have facing us. We feel strapped in our roles as students, parents, or employees. We feel like we are putting in a lot of time and effort but getting little in return. We feel like we are doing the same tasks over and over again. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=3>One way to counteract this stress reaction is to purposely schedule in our daily routine an activity which has lasting value. A few examples include (1) writing a dairy or article where we include thoughts and ideas which are meaningful to us, (2) reading uplifting and informative material and noting ideas which impress us, (3) providing a service for someone which we would not normally do, (4) writing letters of thanks and support to relatives and friends, (5) spending personal time with a child in teaching a skill he or she will need to know, and (6) making something like a table or wall hanging which can be used and enjoyed. These are just a few of the possible activities which can give us a feeling of doing something which will last beyond a day, a week or a month. Stress resulting from our "wheel-spinning" feelings can be reduced if we regularly incorporate more lasting activities into our life.</FONT>
