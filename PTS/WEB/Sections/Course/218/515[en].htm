<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><FONT size=3>There is nothing that will magically help us relieve stress. Effective stress management includes selecting a variety of ways to deal with stress and implementing them over a period of time. A particular stress management technique may be effective on one occasion, but not another, so we need to be ready to implement new ones for any given time and situation. The use of stress management procedures can help us grow from the stresses in our lives rather than being immobilized by them.</FONT></FONT>
