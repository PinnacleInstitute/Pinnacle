<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>The terms <I>bonding</I> and <I>attachment</I> are often used interchangeably, but there is a difference. One grows out of the other. Bonding is about developing trust, and attachment is about developing affection. 
<P>As soon as your baby is born, you begin to bond with her by responding sensitively to her signals. As her attempts at communicating her needs are met with your attempts to understand and meet her needs, she develops trust in you, and in her ability to communicate. She is learning, and so are you. You're getting to know one another. As she gets better at giving signals, and as you get better at reading them, an affectionate relationship develops between you and her. Your baby regards herself by how you respond to her. For this reason, it's important to respond to her cries as well as to her more pleasant signals with love and reassurance. Show her that it's acceptable to express sadness, discomfort, and pain as well as happiness and contentment. Show her that you love her completely.
<P>A high-touch and high-interaction style of parenting that encourages attachment is beneficial to you and your baby in many ways. A baby parented in this way tends to develop better intellectually, emotionally, and physically. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>Intellectually</I>. Your baby learns best when she is in a state of quiet alertness. Attachment parenting helps her spend more time in this state instead of working hard to get her needs met. More than any educational toy or product, the most important influence on her intellectual development is your responsiveness to her signals. 
<P><I>Emotionally</I>. Your baby has trouble regulating her emotions. When you respond to her before her cries escalate out of control, she has an easier time calming herself. 
<P><I>Physically</I>. Your baby releases the hormone cortisol when she is stressed. Too low or too high a level will affect her growth. An insecure attachment to you can cause either problem. Her securely attached relationship with you keeps her cortisol level in balance, so she can use her energy to grow rather than to work hard trying to get you to meet her needs. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Everything you do with your baby is an opportunity for bonding and building attachment. Holding, feeding, diapering or&nbsp;assisting her elimination, and bathing your baby are all ways of bonding with her. She thrives on closeness and interaction with you. For this reason, it's important to be cautious in using products designed to substitute for your presence and care. You already have everything your baby needs. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Nature has given you all the knowledge you need to care for your baby, but our modern culture often makes it difficult to follow your instincts. The following practices can help. 
<P><I>Begin at birth</I>. Get off to a good start by keeping your baby close during the months after birth when you and he are first learning about one another. 
<P><I>Respond sensitively to his signals</I>. His cry is part of his language. When you respond&nbsp;sensitively &nbsp;to his cries as well as other signals, he learns to trust you to meet his needs, and he learns to trust his ability to communicate.&nbsp;Even now, you are helping him learn to talk.&nbsp;
<P><I>Breastfeed your baby</I>. The mothering hormones produced when you breastfeed, prolactin and oxytocin, help you feel calm and relaxed so you can better read and respond to him. Working away from your baby will not prevent you from breastfeeding him when you are together. 
<P><I>Carry your baby</I>. "Wear" him in a baby sling or other carrier that keeps him close to you for most of the day. He will spend more time in a state of quiet alertness if he is carried. Keeping him close also allows you to be more sensitive to his needs. (Visit <A href="http://mamatoto.org/">Mamatoto</A> for more information on baby wearing.)
<P><I>Sleep close to your baby</I>. Sleeping close to your baby will help you meet his nighttime needs. You and he will both likely sleep better when you sleep together. When he wakes during the night next to you, he is more likely to drift back to sleep than if he wakes alone. That means less uncomfortable night waking for you, too.&nbsp;Sharing sleep allows parents who are away from their babies during the day to reconnect. 
<P>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), also called crib death, is a disorder of breathing control during sleep, during which your baby is unable to wake himself. Your presence helps your baby breathe better, and keeps him from sleeping too deeply, the time when episodes of irregular breathing and apnea are more likely to happen. When you sleep next to your baby, his breathing and heartbeat tune to yours. SIDS occurrs far more often in baby's who sleep alone.
<P><I>Care for yourself</I>. You can't meet your baby's needs adequately if you don't also meet your own. He needs healthy parents. Accept help and support from family and friends, set priorities, put people before things, and don't try to do too much.
<P><I>Trust your instincts</I> You will inevitably encounter a person who suggests that you act against your instincts in parenting your baby. New parents are particularly vulnerable to advisers who imply that they are not doing the best thing for their baby. Trust your instincts! If you don't know what to do, seek more information. Don't do something that doesn't feel right.</FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Staying&nbsp;with your baby is the ideal arrangement for both mother and baby, but it's not always possible, especially when parents have become conditioned to a two-income standard of living. When you and your baby are separated, you lose some of the benefits of being together. Your level of attachment is lessened, his stress hormones are higher, and his growth hormones are lower. 
<P>Make the most of your parental leave by practicing full-time attachment parenting. Becoming attached early can make later separation less traumatic for your baby. In developing a strong attachment to him, you may find that you no longer wish to return to work. Evaluate your income needs. Deduct from your paycheck amount the costs of convenience food, transportation, work clothes, child care, and increased medical care due to more frequent illnesses for a daycare baby. Ask yourself if your remaining income is worth the separation. 
<P>If you do return to work, and are unable to take your baby with you, stay connected to your baby during the day by pumping milk, calling home or the daycare center, and keeping him in your mind. Reconnect at home by breastfeeding, carrying your baby, and sharing sleep. 
<P>Choose a nurturing and responsive caregiver. There are several potential child care arrangements. A familiar caregiver who comes to your home may be the least traumatic for your baby. If your workplace has on-site day care, you can check in on him several times each day. If they don't have on-site care, you can join with other mothers and lobby for it. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>An attached relationship between you and your baby creates a foundation for guiding her in the future. For attached parents and their children, discipline is based more on their relationship than on rules. Attached children trust the authority of their parents, so they're more willing to accept limits. Attached parents know their children well, so they're compassionate in guiding them. 
<P>As your baby becomes mobile, it's necessary to regulate her behavior to keep her safe in our busy society. Distraction from the potentially dangerous activity is usually all that a baby needs. If she becomes distressed, show her that while she can't have everything she wants, she always has your love. Learn to see the world through her eyes, and accept that her emotional immaturity will affect what she is capable of. Many of her undesirable behaviors are age-appropriate and will disappear as she grows. 
<P>You don't have to choose between permissiveness and firm discipline. Develop your own style based on the relationship between you and your child. Help her learn self-governance by your positive example. Punishing your baby's unwanted behavior with disapproval or unrelated consequences actually interferes with her ability to learn self-governance later. Instead, try to stop her unsafe behavior without adding to her unhappiness. Show her that you regulate her behavior out of love and a desire to keep her safe. In time, she will learn to look out for herself. Help her out by providing an environment in which she is free to play and explore, and is unlikely to get into trouble. Tell her what to do, rather than what not to do. 
<P>Whatever approach you take to guide her away from missteps and danger, it's important that she never feel that your love and warmth are conditional or that you sometimes want to make her unhappy. You don't have to withhold your love. If she cries when you discipline her, do what your instincts tell you to do--comfort her. She regards herself by how you treat her. Her inner happiness depends on her satisfied expectation of your unconditional love and respect. </FONT></TD>
