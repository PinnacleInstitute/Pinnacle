<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>During these first three months, your baby pays a lot of attention to you. She studies your face and listens to your voice. Encourage her by making funny faces and funny noises, and by reading to her. Each day you see more of her personality emerging. By three months, she tracks objects well with her eyes. Try holding an object about ten inches from her face and move it slowly from side to side and up and down. Try using a rattle or noisy toy to help her locate it. Her eyes may cross as she learns to focus. This is normal. Everything you do with your baby is an opportunity for play and learning. Sing to her while you change her diaper. Name her body parts while you bathe or massage her. All of her senses function well, but she can become overstimulated. Let her relax between different activities if she seems distressed.
<P>Your baby will grow and develop better if you hold her most of the time during this stage. Her place in your arms is her transition from her time spent in your womb. She is calmer and learns more when she is in your arms. Using a sling or other pack will free up your arms for daily activities while satisfying your baby's need for contact. Let her become part of your daily life. She is biologically compelled to be near you and to observe you to learn about being a human. If she is apart from you, she will cry to let you know that she is not where she belongs. 
<P><B>Monthly Milestones</B> 
<P><I>Newborn to One Month</I>: She lies with her limbs flexed close to her body and her hands fisted. She sucks reflexively, startles, and moves her arms and legs jerkily. She uses noverbal signals to communicate and grins in her sleep. She sees up to ten inches, and recognizes your voice. 
<P><I>Two Months</I>: Her limbs begin to relax. She swipes at nearby objects, and opens and closes her hands. She may bring her hand to her mouth, and suck her thumb. She studies faces, and smiles. 
<P><I>Three Months</I>: She stretches her limbs out and opens her hands. She holds her head steady when held in a sitting position. She kicks her legs, and pushes against surfaces. She rolls back to side. She looks at her hands, reaches for objects and places them in her mouth. She recognizes familiar people. She makes vowel sounds, laughs, and cries differently to signal different needs. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>During these months, your baby is becoming more social. He invites you to play with him now. When you shake an object in front of him, he reaches for it, and may put it in his mouth. Help him shake it. He may enjoy peek-a-boo and fingerplay games. There are several variations of peek-a-boo. Cover your face or your baby's face with your hands or a blanket, then "Boo!" peek at him. Be creative. Try finger and toe games during which you act out songs and rhymes with his fingers and toes, and your fingers and toes. 
<P>With his increased interest in the world around him, your baby is less content in positions in which he can't see around. Until he learns to crawl, he still wants to be held most of the time. Try carrying him in an upright position in a sling or other carrier. Respond to his cues to be held or put down. He also wants to practice early sitting and crawling behaviors. He may fight sleep because he doesn't want to miss anything. Try placing him in a low box or bucket to support him in a sitting position.
<P><B>Monthly Milestones</B> 
<P><I>Four Months</I>: He stands with support, and sits propped on his arms. He rolls tummy to side. He plays with his fingers, and reaches with both hands. He can support his chest and head with his arms while lying on his tummy. He laughs when tickled, "talks," and coos to people and objects. 
<P><I>Five Months</I>: He may bounce while held in a standing position. He rolls tummy to back. He may wiggle forward on the ground. He grasps small objects with both hands, and he grabs his feet and pulls them to his mouth. He looks at himself in the mirror. He babbles, mimics sounds, and turns toward your voice.
<P><I>Six Months</I>: He may sit briefly without support. He can roll over in both directions. He may creep forward on his stomach by pushing with his legs. He transfers objects from one hand to the other, and drops toys on purpose. He sees color well. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>During these months, your baby is becoming more active. She reaches out to explore and play. Make sure that she has a safe play area. Now that she can sit, bounce her on your knee while you sing to her. Bounce her from one knee to the other, let her slide down your legs, raise her up, and lean from side to side. Get your busy baby's attention with a puppet or stuffed animal show. Do voices. Portray different emotions. Be creative. Add toys to her bath. Plastic cups are versatile toys that float when empty and sink when full. Pat the water. Splash. Have fun! 
<P>Remember that her favorite thing to do is to learn by watching you and helping you do your regular activities. This is how she learns to be a person. If she is fussy and nothing seems to work, she may be trying to tell you that she needs this learning interaction. Try carrying her while you do the chores. As she grows and gets heavier, but still wants to be held, try switching to a soft backpack. This gives her an exciting viewpoint. 
<P><B>Monthly Milestones</B> 
<P><I>Seven Months</I>: She gets into a sitting position, sits without support, and pivots while sitting. She rocks when on her hands and knees. She rolls from back to stomach. She can briefly bear her weight on her feet. She holds an object in each hand, and may bang them together. She can clasp her hands. She makes consonant sounds and may combine sounds. 
<P><I>Eight Months</I>: She pivots her body while lying on her stomach. She may crawl by pushing backward, or she may scoot on her bottom. She can drop and throw objects. She uses her thumb and forefinger to grasp objects. She can chew and bite. She immitates your mouth movements. She responds to her name, and may show fear of strangers. 
<P><I>Nine Months</I>: She sits well. She tries to crawl, pulls up on furniture, and may sit down after standing. She can put objects in a container and take them out. She may shout to get attention, and she may point. She doesn't want to share toys. She reacts to the word, "no." </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>During these months, your baby is becoming more mobile. He can reach higher than he could before. Try stacking blocks. He may stand on his own to place the highest blocks on the stack. Explore the house with him. Be his tour guide and name objects. He knows the meaning of many familiar items, and may say a few words. He wants to move around on his own, with you close by. Let him tag along when you do the chores. He can follow his curiousity, so if you don't see or hear him, make sure he's safe. If he wakes during the night, he may sit or stand, so make sure his sleep area is safe. Place a large pillow or folded blanket next to the bed to cushion any falls. Show him how to slide feet first out of bed.
<P>Distraction and redirection continue to be effective forms of behavior regulation. As his understanding of words increases, you can begin telling him what you want him to do (rather than what you don't want him to do.) Keep discipline positive when possible, and never withdraw your warmth and affection. He will follow your example and regulate his own behavior (according to his developmental ability) when he sees that you discipline him out of love (not a desire to make him unhappy.) 
<P><B>Monthly Milestones</B> 
<P><I>Ten Months</I>: He crawls and cruises (walks while holding on to furniture.) He may stand without support. He is curious about the contents of containers. He scribbles, plays simple games, and looks at books. He may dance to music.
<P><I>Eleven Months</I>: He practices crawling and cruising. He may swing doors back and forth. He turns pages. He may speak a few words. 
<P><I>Twelve Months</I>: He takes his first steps. He climbs up and down steps. He may undress himself. He points at things that interest him. He may group objects by shape and color. He prefers to feed himself. He practices words and imitates sounds.</FONT></TD>
