<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>During the first weeks, stay in bed with your newborn. Hold her against your skin and feed her frequently according to her cues. Breastfeeding, which causes your body to release the relaxing hormone prolactin, is just what you and she need after the birth. If you choose instead to feed her formula, hold her close while you do so. This early bonding helps you develop attachment later. Keep her close to your body most, if not all, of the time. This closeness is her transition from being in your womb. She is comforted by your familiar heartbeat and voice. Any time she spends out of touch with you, her cries will clearly signal her longing. Babies attach first to their mothers, and so should remain in nearly constant contact with her, although others can help out for short periods as long as the baby isn't distressed by the separation from her mother.
<P><I>Look at your baby</I>. Feel the rush of mothering emotions. Her puffy, slitted eyes open occasionally to look at you. Brown eyes will likely stay brown, but blue or green eyes can later change. She can see and follow movement, and she can focus on you at about ten inches, the distance from her nursing position at your breast to your face. Her nose is flattened and her head is elongated from her trip down the narrow birth canal. You feel a soft area on her head (called the fontanel) where her skull bones come together. There's a tough membrane under this soft area so it's ok to touch. She might have hair, but it may soon fall out and its color may change. The tops of her ears may be pinned back or folded over. Red pimply patches (called milia) may cover her forehead, nose, and eyelids. They will disappear on their own within a few weeks. Don't squeeze them. Her neck is obscured by fat rolls. 
<P><I>Touch her</I>. Stroking your baby stimulates her to breathe more rhythmically. Her pink-purple skin may be covered in a white substance, and she may have hair on her shoulders and back. Her hands and feet are wrinkled and bluish. Her arms and legs are flexed toward her chest and abdomen. Feel her quick heartbeat. It's twice as fast as yours. Her breathing is light and irregular for the first few hours. Keep her close to you so she can tune her heart and lungs to yours.
<P>Your touch is therapeutic. Babies grow and develop better when they are regularly touched. Massage sessions also help you and her stay connected. 
<P><I>Talk to her</I>. She recognizes your voice. Her father's voice may be particularly familiar since lower tones are heard more easily through amniotic fluid. 
<P><I>Respond to her cries</I>. She is trying to communicate&nbsp;her needs to you. With practice, your parent-infant communication system of cue and response will get better and better. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2><B>Newborn Procedures</B> 
<P>You may ask the hospital (if this is where you give birth) to delay the following routine procedures until after you've spent time bonding with your newborn. 
<P><I>Vitamin K</I>: Your baby may receive this injection to promote normal blood clotting and to lesson his risk of abnormal bleeding into vital tissues. Studies have shown that the same dose of vitamin K given orally is just as effective in healthy, full-term babies. 
<P><I>Eye ointment</I>: The antibiotic ointment, erythromycin, may be put into your baby's eyes to protect against germs that may have entered his eyes during his passage through the birth canal. This ointment may temporarily blur his vision so it's best to put it off until you've had time to look at each other. 
<P><I>Blood tests</I>: A sample of your baby's umbilical cord blood may be taken to determine his blood type and Rh factor. Several drops of blood are taken from his heel for screening for hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria (PKU), and galactosemia. The PKU test will be repeated before your baby's third week. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>hypothyroidism</I>: This condition, in which your baby has an inadequate thyroid gland, if undetected and untreated, may cause mental retardation. 
<P><I>phenylketonuria</I>: This inherited enzyme deficiency, if untreated, can result in brain damage. 
<P><I>galactosemia</I>: This disorder, which prevents the metabolism of galactose, if untreated, results in vital organ damage. 
<P><I>Jaundice</I>: If your baby develops this yellowing of the skin caused by the buildup in his blood of a yellow pigment called bilirubin, his bilirubin level may be measured by taking a few drops of blood from his heel. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>First Checkup</B> 
<P>Your baby may receive his first checkup within twenty-four hours of his birth. It is done either by the pediatrician or family practitioner that you have chosen or by the pediatrician on duty at the hospital. The doctor forms his first impression of your baby's general health by looking at him. Then he checks your baby's head, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and body. 
<P><I>Head</I>: The doctor checks your baby's head for any abnormalities. Most lumps and bumps are normal. The fontanel should be soft and flat. His head circumfrence should be in proportion to his height and weight. 
<P><I>Eyes</I>: The doctor shines a light into your baby's eyes to determine if he has any cataracts or internal eye problems. He checks your baby's eyes for normal size. Any ruptured blood vessels clear up within a few weeks. 
<P><I>Nose</I>: The doctor makes sure that your baby's nasal passages are open enough to allow air through. 
<P><I>Mouth</I>: The doctor checks that the front of your baby's tongue is not attached too tightly to the floor of his mouth. This could prevent good latch-on during breastfeeding. This too-tight tongue tip (called tongue-tie) usually loosens in time. The doctor also checks that the roof of your baby's mouth (the palate) is fully formed. 
<P><I>Ears</I>: Your baby's ears may be pinned to his head, folded over, or sticking out. His earlobes may be bruised. This is normal. The outer appearance of his ears may change. The doctor shines a light into his ears to determine if they are correctly formed on the inside. 
<P><I>Neck</I>: The doctor checks your baby's neck and collarbone to make sure there are no abnormal lumps or fracture. 
<P><I>Heart and Lungs</I>: The doctor moves his stethoscope over your baby's chest to make sure that his heart beat is normal and that air is properly entering and leaving his lungs. 
<P><I>Abdomen</I>: The doctor feels for your baby's liver, spleen, and kidneys to determine their size and correct position. 
<P><I>Genitals and Groin Area</I>: Your daughter's vulva or your son's testes may be swollen due to hormones and extra fluid accumulated at birth. Your daughter may have a white, or blood-tinged vaginal discharge. This is normal. The doctor checks that your daughter's vaginal opening is normal, or that your son's testicles are descended, and that his anus is open and properly located. He moves your baby's thighs around the hip joints to determine if he has dislocatable hips, a condition easily treated in a newborn. He also feels for your baby's strong femoral pulse in the center of his groin which indicates that the blood vessel coming out of his heart is large enough. 
<P><I>Legs and Feet</I>: Your baby's legs are normally bowed and his feet are slightly curved in. He may have inherited webbed, oversized, or overlapping toes. </FONT></TD>

<TD colSpan=2><FONT color=#990000 size=3><B>Initial Bodily Needs and Basic Care</B></FONT></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD colSpan=2>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>The following paragraphs contain instructions on meeting your baby's initial needs. 
<P><I>Cord Stump</I>: If your baby's cord was cut, the plastic clamp on her umbilical cord stump is usually removed within twenty-four hours of her birth. Keep her cord stump dry, and fold her diaper below it. (Better yet,&nbsp;hold her on an absorbent pad or diaper&nbsp;instead of in a diaper.) Avoid immersing her in water to bathe her. Sponge her clean if needed until the stump falls off. It may be swollen and moist during the first few days, then it dries and shrivels over the next few days. The cord may smell slightly. The skin around the stump should look normal and not inflamed. The stump falls off within two weeks. It's normal to see a few drops of blood then. 
<P><I>Foreskin</I>: An intact foreskin protects your baby's penis from irritation and infection caused by wet or soiled diapers. (If you are not comfortable with the use of diapers, I will discuss an alternative to diapers later in the course.) His foreskin is tight for the first year. During this time, normal bathing is all the care it needs. Do not forcibly retract your son's foreskin. By three years old, his foreskin should be fully retractable. During his baths, pull back his foreskin and gently clean out the secretions that accumulate under it. Teach him to clean himself this way. 
<P><I>Circumcision Site</I>: 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><I>About Circumcision</I>: The decision to circumcise is made for religious or cultural reasons or out of preference. Your baby is placed on a restraining board, his hands and feet are secured, and up to one-half of the skin of his penis is cut away. The use of a local anesthetic during the circumcision may not remove all of your baby's pain, but it helps.&nbsp;His&nbsp;surgery site&nbsp;should heal&nbsp;within a week. As with any surgical procedure, occasional problems may occur such as bleeding, infection, or injury to the penis. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Follow your doctor's instructions on caring for your baby's circumcision site. Apply a protective lubricant over his circumcision site each time you change his diaper for the first few days. During the first week, his circumcision wound will go from swollen to yellow-scabbed. His penis should not be red or draining pus. 
<P><I>Feeding</I>: A breastfed baby will nurse frequently from every twenty minutes to about every two hours. She will be hungry more often than a bottlefed baby because breast milk is more easily digested than formula. Make sure that she latches on correctly. Sit up or lie on your side. Turn her to face you, belly to belly. Tickle her cheek with your nipple. When her mouth is open, pull her toward your breast. Place as much of your breast in her mouth as possible. Your nipple should be deep inside her mouth to protect it from being sucked directly. It takes several weeks to learn to breastfeed, and a couple of months to become an expert. Don't give up if you want to breastfeed. If you experience sore nipples or other problems, experiment with new positions, and contact a local <A href="http://lalecheleague.org/"><FONT color=#990000>La Leche League</FONT></A> group or lactation consultant. It may take several months to develop a problem-free breastfeeding relationship.
<P>Whether breastfeeding or bottlefeeding with breast milk or formula, feed your baby when she signals that she is hungry, according to her own schedule. She is learning to trust you. 
<P><I>Burping</I>: Your baby may need to be burped, or she may not. After feeding, place her on your shoulder or across your lap and pat or rub her back. She may spit up with her burp. If she doesn't burp within a couple of minutes and she seems content, she probably doesn't need to burp. If she falls asleep while feeding, it's not necessary to wake her to burp. 
<P><I>Diapering</I>: Look at changing your baby's diaper as an opportunity for bonding. Focus on your baby, not the job, so she will look forward to the process. Talk to her and smile at her. Avoid showing distaste for the job, because your baby regards herself by what she sees on your face. 
<P>You have several choices when it comes to dealing with your baby's elimination: cloth diapers, disposables, or neither (called natural infant hygiene or elimination communication.) If you choose cloth diapers, you may use fitted or flat diapers, and home washing or diaper service. Cloth diaper covers with velcro straps have replaced pins and plastic pants.&nbsp;
<P>Parents who choose to raise their babies without diapers learn to read their babies' cues and take them to the appropriate place to eliminate. Many cultures practice this natural infant hygiene. (Visit <A href="http://www.natural-wisdom.com/nihgentlealternative.htm"><FONT color=#990000>natural-wisdom.com</FONT></A> for more information on natural infant hygiene.)
<P>Change diapers frequently. To determine if a disposable diaper is wet, squeeze the outside of the diaper. If you feel gel, the diaper is wet and needs to be changed. Even though disposable diapers absorb moisture away from your baby's skin, it is not sanitary to leave them on after wet or soiled. Creams and ointments are not necessary for rashless bottoms. 
<P>While changing your baby's diaper on a changing table, never take both hands off her. She can fall off the table in an instant. Always use the safety strap, but don't rely on it. When using a public changing table, test the table's security before placing your baby on it. 
<P>As your baby gets older, she will squirm and wiggle while you change her diaper. This resistance is to be expected. Be creative in distracting her. Sing to her. Dangle a toy from your mouth. Make funny faces. If she squirms too much, change her on the floor where it's safer. If your baby is distressed by wearing a diaper, you may consider&nbsp;the diaper free method. (Visit <A href="http://diaperfreebaby.org/">DiaperFreeBaby</A> to locate a support and education group near you.)
<P><I>Dressing</I>: In general, dress your baby in as much or as little clothing as you wear plus a layer such as a sweater or blanket. Cold hands and feet indicate her need for more warmth. Hot, sweaty skin indicates her need to be cooler. Her clothing should be breathable and well fitting so she can move freely. A baby who sleeps alone can wear a blanket sleeper, but one who sleeps with you should be undressed or dressed more lightly for bed to avoid becoming overheated by your body heat. 
<P><I>Bathing</I>: Your baby needs to be bathed only about twice per week as needed. Spot clean areas such as behind her ears and in crevices daily. Use mild soap only on oily or sweaty areas. Her hair does not need to be shampooed. In fact, if you never use shampoo on her, she will never need it.&nbsp; Don't use oils or powders on your baby after her bath, because they can irritate her sensitive skin. 
<P>Until her cord falls off (and until your son's circumcision site heals), sponge-bathe your baby. You need soft washcloths, baby soap, and a clean towel. Wrap your baby in a blanket or towel. Uncover her head. Wet a washcloth with warm water. Gently wash her face, behind her ears, and in her neck crevices. Unless she is dirty, use only water. Wet her head with the washcloth and gently massage her hair. Rinse her scalp over the sink with running water. Blot her head dry and cover it to keep her warm. Uncover the rest of her body and gently wash her with the warm washcloth. Wash all her crevices. When cleaning around her vagina, always wash from front to back to avoid contamination from her anus. It is not necessary to wash away any vaginal discharge. Do not retract the foreskin of an uncircumcised boy's penis. 
<P><I>Finger and Toe Nails</I>: Trim or file your baby's nails while she is asleep is she squirms otherwise. Use a nail clipper designed for babies. Depress her finger pad away from her nail as you cut. If you are afraid to cut her nails, use a nail file. Her toenails won't grow as fast, but keep an eye on them.</FONT></TD>

<TD colSpan=2><FONT color=#990000 size=3><B>Early Concerns</B></FONT></TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD colSpan=2>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Most of the following common concerns are normal occurences and will go away on their own or with home treatment within a couple of weeks. 
<P><B>Eyes</B> 
<P><I>Blocked Tear Ducts</I>: The tiny ducts at the inside corners of your baby's eyes may clog. Her tears will build up in her eyes and become infected. If you notice a yellow discharge from one or both eyes, gently massage the inside corner of her eye. Massage upward toward her nose several times a day until the discharge disappears. Her ducts may clog from time to time, but should remain open after she is six months old. 
<P><I>Red-Streaked Eyes</I>: These blood vessels broke during your baby's birth. They will heal on their own within a few weeks. 
<P><B>Mouth</B> 
<P><I>Oral Thrush</I>: This yeast infection inside your baby's mouth may itch and cause her soreness. Ask your doctor for an antifungal medication or spread a fingertipful of acidophilus powder on the thrush twice daily for a week. (Acidophilus powder is available in the refrigerated section of a health food store.) Your baby may transfer her thrush to your nipples. Treat your nipple thrush the same way you treat your baby's oral thrush. 
<P><I>Lip Blisters</I>: Your baby's upper lip may develop blisters or calluses (called sucking pads) during the first month. They develop in response to her vigorous sucking and will subside by the end of her first year. 
<P><B>Skin Marks (called nevi)</B>: 
<P><I>Stork Bites</I>: These birthmarks result where overgrown blood vessels bunch up and show through her thin skin. They are most prominent on her eyelids, middle of the forehead, and nape of the neck. As the blood vessels shrink and your baby's skin thickens, they disappear or fade. 
<P><I>Stawberries</I>: These birthmarks appear a week or two after birth. They begin as a raised red circle and grow to strawberry size during your baby's first year. These marks are the result of blood vessels that went astray and kept growing. By the time your child is three years old, most strawberries shrivel. 
<P><I>Moles</I>: These brown-black marks range from freckle-size to large, hairy patches. Most moles are harmless. 
<P><B>Rashes</B> 
<P><I>Milia</I>: These tiny whiteheads on your baby's face are caused by secretions that plug her skin pores. They will disappear within a few weeks. 
<P><I>Prickly Heat</I>: This reddish pimply rash appears on your baby's moist areas such as her neck folds, behind her ears, and in her groin. Gently wash her skin with cool water and dress her in light-weight, loose cotton clothing. 
<P><I>Newborn Acne</I>: This red, pimply, oily rash (called seborrheic dermatitis) covers much of your baby's face. Gently wash her face with water and mild soap. Acne peaks around her third week and clears up within six weeks. 
<P><I>Cradle Cap</I>: This crusty, oily rash on your baby's scalp (another form of seborrheic dermatitis) may resemble dandruff or may appear more plaquelike. Gently wash her scalp with water once per week. More frequent washings will dry out her scalp and make the cradle cap worse. To treat a more severe case, massage vegetable oil into the crusty areas to soften them. Let it sit for fifteen minutes, then gently remove the scales with a comb. Wash off the oil with mild baby shampoo. 
<P><I>Diaper Rash</I>: This common rash is caused by friction from diapers, bacteria and fungi, and excessive moisture on your baby's sensitive skin. To lessen the incidence of rash, change your baby's wet or soiled diapers frequently. Expect to change your baby at least eight times each day. Rinse and wipe your baby's bottom well. Plain water is usually sufficient and the easiest on her skin. Keep diapers loose fitting so air can circulate inside. Apply a generous amount of barrier cream to your baby's bottom to prevent her rash from getting worse. If you wash your own cloth diapers, add one-half cup of vinegar to the rinse cycle to remove soap residues and alkaline irritants.
<P><B>Other</B> 
<P><I>Noisy Breathing</I>: Irregular and noisy breathing is normal for your baby's first few weeks. Because she breathes through her nose, her tiny nasal passages are easily congested by lint, dust, perfumes, or cigarette smoke. She sneezes often to clear her nose. Her breathing will become more normal by the end of the first month. 
<P>To help your baby breathe more easily while she is awake, place her on her stomach with her head turned to one side. This allows her tongue and saliva to come forward and make more room for air to pass through. (Put her on her back to sleep.) Keep her environment as dust and lint free as possible. Keep her away from cigarette smoke and perfumes, and don't wear a strong deodorant.
<P><I>Weight Loss</I>: Your newborn loses about five to eight percent of her birth weight during the first week. She will lose less weight if you keep her close and feed her on cue. 
<P><I>Navel Protrusion</I>: Whether your baby has an outie or an innie depends on the way her umbilical cord stump healed, not on the way it was cut. Sometimes there is an opening between the two bands of muscles that encircle the navel. You may feel your baby's intestines bulge through this opening beneath her skin. This is called an umbilical hernia. Don't tape over the hernia because this may lead to infection. It will usually heal in time. 
<P><I>Shakes</I>: Your baby's immature nervous system causes frequent quivers and shakes. These muscle twitches subside by the time she is three months old. 
<P><I>Spitting up</I>: It's normal for your baby to spit up several times each day. She gulps air with her milk, the air settles beneath the milk in the stomach, then the milk comes up with the air. To help her keep more milk down, avoid jostling her after a feeding. Feed her less milk more frequently. Try burping her after three ounces of formula or between switching breasts. (See <I>The Baby Book</I> for instructions on burping.) Keep her upright for at least twenty minutes after her feeding. She should stop spitting up by six or seven months old. 
<P><I>Elimination Patterns</I>: After three days, your baby produces six to eight wet diapers per day. Her urine is clear or light yellow. Her first bowel movement, called meconium, is a black-green, tarry substance composed of amniotic fluid debris from her intestines. The stools of a breastfed infant become soft and yellow with a slight sour odor. The formula-fed infant's stools are darker, firmer, have a more unpleasant smell, and are passed less frequently. The frequency varies from several stools per day to one every couple of days (but usually not until she is one or two months old.) </FONT></TD>
