<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Prevent common accidents and allergies by following these practices: 
<P><I>General</I>: Keep drapery cords out of reach. Pad furniture edges. Cover unused electrical outlets. Remove toxic plants. Keep doors, windows, and screens locked. Use safety gates to create large,&nbsp;safe play areas (not to contain your baby.) Keep washer and dryer doors closed. Keep floors and carpets clean because allergens, dust, and chemicals settle there. 
<P><I>Kitchen</I>: Make sure all breakable and sharp objects, and anything poisonous or that could cause choking is well out of his reach. Keep all small appliances unplugged and have a multi-purpose fire extinguisher available. Make sure appliance cords and table clothes don't dangle over edges. Keep safety latches on cabinet and appliance doors. 
<P><I>Bathroom</I>: Treat medications and cosmetics as poisons and keep them out of reach. Keep safety caps on medicines and dispose of out-of-date ones. Keep scissors, razor blades, and pins out of reach. Place nonskid mats in the tub and shower, and pad tub faucets. Use slipproof backing on bathroom rugs. Keep electrical appliances away from water. Drain water from the tub immediately after use. Never leave your baby unattended. Keep the toilet seat down and latched. Remove the inside lock on the bathroom door. Instead, install a hook high up on the door for privacy. 
<P><I>Bedroom or Nursery</I>: Your baby's&nbsp;sleep area&nbsp;should be well ventilated because he's vulnerable to the fumes emitted by many products, such as particle board furniture, fresh paint, synthetic carpeting, vinyl products, and the dust mites in matresses and stuffed cushions and toys that may cause him adverse health effects when concentrated in the air. See below for crib safety tips. 
<P>If your baby sleeps in your bed, consider the following tips for sharing sleep safely. Don't sleep with your baby when you are under the influence of drugs or if you are obese. Otherwise, place him on a firm surface between his mother and a guardrail or the wall. A sleeping mother is naturally more sensitive to her baby's presence than a sleeping father or sibling. Also, being between two bodies may overheat your baby. Make sure the bed is against the wall. Avoid overdressing your baby for bed. Your body heat and light cover is enough to keep him warm. Place pillows on the floor in case he falls out of bed. 
<P><I>Yard</I>: Store away garden hoses. While your baby is playing outside, watch for insects, make sure he doesn't put poisonous plants in his mouth, and stays away from areas where pesticides or herbicides are used. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Carefully evaluate the safety of your baby's toys and equipment, and always use them appropriately. Baby holders, chairs, swings, etc., can be convenient places to put your baby when you need to get something done, but be careful not to leave your young baby in these devices for long periods. She needs to be near you to grow and develop to her potential. 
<P><I>Crib</I>: Cribs are a common source of accidents. If you use a crib, make sure it conforms to safety standards. Look for a safety label. Locate the crib in an area where your baby won't fall on sharp edges or lodge between furniture if he climbs out. Make sure he can't release the drop side from inside his crib. The bars should be no more than about two and a half inches (six centimeters) apart. Check the crib for cracks and splinters. Use a firm matress of the appropriate size. Periodically tighten nuts and bolts. Remove crib bumpers as soon as he begins to pull himself up or he may use them to climb over the rail. Avoid fuzzy animals that become home to dust mites which can trigger asthma. If time allows, let a new crib and matress, and other baby furniture,&nbsp;sit for several months before placing your baby in them. This allows toxic chemicals to outgas before your baby is near.
<P><I>High Chair</I>: Place your baby's high chair away from stoves, windows, shelves or other potential dangers. Always use the safety belt, and be sure the tray is securely latched. Make sure the chair is sturdy. 
<P><I>Stroller</I>: Test the brakes. Always use both wheel brakes. Make sure a collapsable stroller is securely latched into its open form. Make sure the stroller is sturdy. 
<P><I>Playpen</I>: Playpens should only be used for short periods of time when they do not distress your baby. Bars should be no more than about two and one half inches (six centimeters) apart. Avoid mesh playens with large netting that your baby could use to climb out. Make sure latches are secure. 
<P><I>Car Seat</I>: Use the correct type of car seat for your baby's height, weight, and age. Install the seat in the correct location in your car, facing the correct direction, and at the correct angle according to the manual. Secure the seat tightly in your car. Never install the seat near an air bag. 
<P><I>Toys</I>: Make sure toys are appropriate for your baby's stage of development. Make sure they have no small parts that she could choke on. As a general rule, if a toy or one of its parts can fit inside a toilet paper roll, your baby could choke on it. Make sure toys have no sharp edges or dangling strings longer than eight inches. Avoid toy boxes with lids. Toy shelves are safer.

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>When traveling by car, always use a correctly installed car seat that is appropriate for your baby's age and size. Don't leave a hatchback open because it could let in exhaust fumes. Don't let your baby play with sharp or hard objects that could be dangerous if the car stops suddenly. Traveling may be easier if you feed and change your baby's diaper before you leave, and if you travel at nap time. 
<P>When traveling by bus, train, or airplane, you are expected to carry your baby on your lap unless you buy a ticket for him. If you plan to use your car seat on an airplane, make sure it is certified for use in an aircraft. It should be no wider than sixteen inches. The car seat can't be placed on the aisle seat or in an exit row, so notify the airline that you will use a car seat when you buy your tickets. (Visit <A href="http://www.cpsafety.com/articles/airplanetravel.aspx"><FONT color=#990000>cpsafety.com</FONT></A> for information on using a child safety seat on an airplane.) 
<P>Nurse or give your baby a bottle during takeoff and especially during landing to ease painful pressure in his ears. He may experience gas pain during takeoff. Avoid giving him any foods that may cause gas for at least twenty-four hours prior to your flight. Place a warm, moist washcloth under his nose to humidify the dry cabin air. 
<P>Pack extra supplies such as diapers, washcloths, formula, changes of clothes, blankets, snacks, and toys in case of unexpected delays. Don't mix dry formula beforehand because refrigeration may not be available to you. Consider the safety of public water where you are going.
<P>When in a new time zone, don't expect your baby to adjust to the new time. Keep to his usual routine. Bring familiar items from home to help him feel comfortable. Babyproof your hotel room, and carefully evaluate hotel cribs and other equipment for safety. </FONT></TD>
