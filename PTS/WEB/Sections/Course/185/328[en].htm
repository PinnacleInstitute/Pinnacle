<P><FONT face=arial size=2>Your baby will be ready to try solids, like all development, according to his own schedule. Generally, this is between four and eight months of age when&nbsp;his tongue movements, swallowing skills, and intestines are ready. He will also be getting his first teeth, and he will be able to sit, supported,&nbsp;at the table with you. He will watch you eat, and may reach for your food. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial size=2>Always feed your baby in an upright position. Place his high chair, if he uses one,&nbsp;away from hazards, always use the safety belt, and be sure the tray is securely attached. Start with foods that resemble breast milk or formula in taste and texture such as pureed banana or other soft fruit. You may mix these first foods with breast milk or formula. Make the mixture thin for the first feedings.&nbsp;Test the temperature of the food to make sure it's not too hot. Place a small amount on your finger and put it in his mouth. Let him suck on your finger. Leave the glob on his tongue. If he pushes it back out, he may not be ready for solids.</FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial size=2>Don't expect him to eat much at first. Introduce only one new food at a time, at least a week apart. Avoid common allergens such as dairy products, wheat, and soy. Watch for signs of allergic reaction such as a skin rash, diarrhea, vomiting, or nasal congestion. 
<P>His goal is to learn to eat, not to get a balanced meal. He will still get most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula. Nibbling throughout the day is nutritionally better than eating a few large meals. Feeding your baby takes time. You may have to be creative to get food into him, but never force it. Avoid causing him to laugh while he has food in his mouth to prevent choking. If he chokes, don't intervene if he can cough or cry. Try to keep him from panicking, and be ready to intervene if necessary.

<LI>Wash the fruit or vegetable well. Avoid acidic fruits.
<LI>Remove tough parts that could cause choking. 
<LI>You can add a small amount of lemon juice as natural preservative, but don't add sugar or salt. 
<LI>Steam the fruit or vegetable to preserve vitamins and minerals. Bake potatoes or squash in their skins, then remove the skins. 
<LI>Mash and puree the fruit or vegetable. 
<LI>Pour or spoon the mush into an ice cube tray and freeze. 
<LI>Place the cubes into freezer bags, label and date. Keep food up to three months in the freezer. 
<LI>Let a serving defrost in the refrigerator for three or four hours. 
<LI>Warm and serve.

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>At this age, she eats courser foods. Her swallowing is more coordinated. She feeds herself by picking up bite-sized pieces of food with her thumb and forefinger. Some babies do not develop an interest in eating until they can feed themselves this way.&nbsp;Foods should still be soft and dissolvable such as ripe fruit,&nbsp;soft pieces of vegetable, and small bits of meat. Her front teeth are for biting only. Her chewing teeth won't appear until she's around one year old. She may delight in mess making, but avoid laughing at her, because her laughter could be a choking hazard.&nbsp; 
<P>Your baby's sugar and salt content could go way up if you're not careful as she may be sampling food from your plate. Eat healthfully. If you give her juice, dilute it with two-thirds water. Juice is more caloric than it is nutritious. Juice can also displace more nutritious breastmilk or formula. Avoid cow's milk, other dairy products, and egg whites until she is at least one year old. Even after one, dairy product allergies are common. Foods high in animal protein, including dairy products, inhibit the&nbsp;retention of calcium (even though they may contain lots of it.) Kids need fruits, vegetables, sunlight, and exercise to build strong bones. Fruits and vegetables improve the retention of calcium. (Visit <A href="http://strongbones.org/"><FONT color=#990000>strongbones.org</FONT></A> for more information on kids and calcium.) 
<P>As your baby eats more solids and drinks less breast milk or formula, the nutritional balance of her diet is more important.&nbsp;She should, however, still be receiving most of her nutrients from breast milk or formula. The five nutritional elements you monitor are proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. 
<P><I>Proteins</I>: These are the structural components of your baby's cells. Protein accounts for approximately ten to fifteen percent of her total calories. If she gets too little, her body doesn't function properly. If she gets too much, she uses energy disposing of waste that she could use for growing. 
<P>Complete proteins, such as meat, fish, poultry, and eggs contain all nine essential amino acids that our bodies can't manufacture, but many of these protein sources also contain an excess of unhealthy nutrients like high levels of saturated fats. (Soy can cause calcium and vitamin D deficiency, and may interfere with your baby's thyroid function. Grains can also inhibit the absorption of certain nutrients.) 
<P><I>Complex Carbohydrates</I>:&nbsp;Fruits and vegetables provide&nbsp;an abundance of vitamins and minerals&nbsp;and&nbsp;balance&nbsp;protein consumption.
<P><I>Fat and Cholesterol</I>: Your baby needs fat and cholesterol to grow and develop. Breast milk contains forty-four percent saturated fats. The only fats she needs to avoid are artificially processed hydrogenated fats. Your baby is naturally chubby until she becomes more active. If you are worried about her weight, ask your doctor for an opinion. 
<P><I>Vitamins and Minerals</I>: These micronutrients help your baby's body work better. Give her a variety of foods and she should get all the vitamins she needs. Human milk and fortified formulas contain all the essential vitamins. Avoid iron-deficiency by spacing solids and breast milk or formula by twenty minutes as foods, such as dairy products, may interfere with your baby's absorption of iron. Salt occurs naturally in nearly all foods so she won't need extra. </FONT></TD>
