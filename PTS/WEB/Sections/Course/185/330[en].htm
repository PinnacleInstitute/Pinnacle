<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Keep your baby well by feeding him good food and by making sure his air and environment are clean. Good food, especially breast milk, promotes good health. It prevents illnesses and allergies, reduces infections, and comforts him when he's sick. Pollutants in his environment can irritate his sensitive breathing passages. 
<P>During wellness checkups, request that your baby stay on your lap or in your arms during his exam so that he will be more calm and the exam will be more accurate. You may bring a list of questions to ask. The doctor discusses your baby's growth and development, nutrition, and illness and accident prevention. Your baby receives a physical exam, measurements are taken, and his hearing and vision are evaluated. He may receive immunizations or lab tests. Immunizations stimulate your baby's body to create antibodies to particular diseases, but also may leave his immune system depressed to other illnesses or diseases.
<P>Attached parents often know their child is sick even before he displays symptoms. His behavior may change subtly. More obvious signs of sickness are fever, lethargy, faster breathing, and faster heart rate. 
<P>Help him heal from many common illnesses by encouraging him to rest, giving him extra fluids, fresh air, liquid food, and slow-release sugars. Get a doctor's recommendation before giving medicines. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>You can adequately treat many common illnesses at home. 
<P><I>Fever</I>: Fever is her body's normal response to an infection. You should worry more about how sick she seems than on how high her fever is, unless it reaches 107 degrees Fahrenheit (41.7 degrees Celsius). Always report fever to the doctor if your baby is under three months. 
<P>Your baby's normal body temperature varies from 97 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (36 to 37.8 degrees Celsius). Her daily temperature can fluctuate by one to one and one-half degrees above and below normal. Generally, a rectal temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) in the morning, or over 101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius) in the afternoon, indicates a fever. Her forehead feels hot, her breathing is faster with hot breath, and she may sweat. Rectal thermometers are most accurate for determining your baby's temperature.
<P>To reduce her temperature, you can give acetaminophen, remove some or all of her clothing, give her a lukewarm bath, give fluids, and liquid food.&nbsp;Keep her cool, but not so cold she shivers. Shivering raises her temperature. 
<P><I>Cold</I>: This upper respiratory infection is caused by viral or bacterial germs infecting the lining of your baby's breathing passages and bronchi. Her body responds by developing a runny nose, coughing, and sneezing. 
<P>To treat a cold, keep secretions moving so bacteria doesn't breed. Clear your baby's nose, give her extra fluids, and run a vaporizer while she sleeps.&nbsp;If you don't have a vaporizer, hold your baby in the bathroom while the hot shower steams up the room. The ideal humidity for her sleeping room is between 30 and 50 percent. 
<P>Her cold should get better over three to five days. Call the doctor if it doesn't, if your baby seems really sick, or if she develops eye discharge. 
<P><I>Inhalant Allergies</I>: Allergies can seem like a cold, but they are caused most commonly by pollens, animal dander, molds, or dust. 
<P>Pollens may be the cause of your baby's allergy symptoms if they occur seasonally. To reduce her symptoms, keep your baby indoors on windy days and away from weedy and flowery fields during pollen season. Bathe her and&nbsp;rinse her hair before bed, and keep the windows closed in her sleeping room. Don't hang her bedding and clothing outside to dry because they will catch pollens. 
<P>Animal dander, your pet's shed skin, may be the cause of your baby's allergies if her symptoms occur when she plays with your pet. Keep her and your pet apart, especially when indoors, as much as is necessary to clear up her symptoms. 
<P>Molds, the spores of plants, may be the cause of your baby's allergies if her syptoms occur when she is near dark, cool, damp places such as cellars, closets, attics, piles of clothing, damp carpet, or shower curtains and stalls. The use of a humidifier can also promote mold growth. To reduce your baby's symptoms, air out and clean mold sites, remove damp carpet and wallpaper, and clean drapery and wallpaper when a humidifier is in use. 
<P>The excrement of dust mites that live among dust in warm, humid environments may be the cause of your baby's allergies if her symptoms occur around carpets, bedding, upholstered furniture, or anywhere else that flakes of shed human skin collect. Minimize dust to clear up your baby's symptoms. 
<P><I>Ear Infections</I>: When germs enter your baby's nose and throat, they can spread to her inner ear through her eustachian tube. Fluid can get trapped in the inner ear, and can cause infection, pressure, and pain. Signs that your baby has developed an infection include thick nasal secretions, eye and ear drainage, sleep pattern changes, irritability, crying, sudden worsening of a cold, and refusal to lie flat. Relieve her pain by squirting a few drops of warm vegetable or olive oil into her sore ear. Prevent ear infections by breastfeeding, avoiding allergens and dairy products, feeding her in an upright position (not necessary when breastfeeding), and treating colds early. 
<P><I>Diarrhea</I>: These liquid stools are most commonly caused by an intestinal infection called gastroenteritis. Diarrhea stools are frequent, green, watery, muscousy, foul smelling, and explosive. They often cause a red rash around the anus. While your baby has diarrhea, give her extra fluids to prevent dehydration, and reduce or eliminate any new foods or potential irritating foods such as dairy products, juices, and high-fat foods. 
<P><I>Constipation</I>: These compact and difficult to pass stools may tear your baby's rectum and cause blood streaks on her stool. If she is formula-fed, give her an extra bottle of water each day because formula is more concentrated than breast milk. Try other formulas to see if they are easier on stools. Avoid constipating foods such as white rice, rice cereal, bananas, apples, cooked carrots, and dairy products. For older babies, add fiber foods such as vegetables and fruits.
