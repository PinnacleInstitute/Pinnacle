<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Successful adjustment to life with your new baby requires that you have realistic expectations. If at first things are not what you expected, try to&nbsp;be flexible and to maintain a relaxed attitude.&nbsp;The early weeks with your newborn are a time to learn to fit together as a family. You will be giving a lot of energy to your baby in the beginning. If this doesn't come naturally to you, think of it as an important investment that will pay off in the future. Focus on the good feelings you get when you and your baby are close, and be easy on yourself. Parenting a newborn&nbsp;can be hard work, but it is rewarding, as was labor and childbirth. It's all about perspective.
<P>Your most important goal during these first weeks&nbsp;is to get to know your baby by learning to read and respond sensitively to her cues. Leave everything else to someone else. When friends and family offer to help, let them do your chores, or just let your chores wait. Don't be afraid to send well-meaning helpers away. These first weeks can be physically and emotionally draining. Rest and relax.
<P>Some&nbsp;new parents, particularly mothers, experience after-birth depression. New parents don't always get the support they need, as everyone tends to focus on the new baby. It's normal for mothers to experience hormonal changes and body fatigue while birth wounds heal; and for fathers to feel left out of the initial mother-baby bonding process. Fortunately, your baby's high-need newborn period passes, and you settle into a comfortable parenting routine. Until then, think motherly and fatherly thoughts, communicate your feelings, and rest when you can. Staying close to your baby is an often overlooked treatment for the baby blues. 
<P>If after-birth depression doesn't subside by the end of the first few weeks when your hormones should be back in balance, or if your depression seems to be getting worse, you may need to seek help. If your depression is noticeable to the people around you, it's serious enough to warrant a call to your doctor. 
<P>New parents are particularly vulnerable to baby advice that implies that they aren't doing the best for their baby. If you're confused about what to do, ask yourself what feels right. Ask for guidance when you need it, but never act against your instincts, because nature has given you all the knowledge you need to appropriately care for your baby. This is the golden rule of making parenting choices: do what feels right, because nobody knows your baby like you do. 
<P>If you didn't get off to the start you hoped for, begin again as if it were your baby's first day. Hold her, look at her, and talk to her.</FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>You and your partner are a team. Work together to meet your baby's needs, and help one another adjust to your new roles as parents. Both of you are putting your personal interests on hold. It's impossible to split your baby's care fifty-fifty, so at times, one parent provides more of his care. Try not to keep track of who is sacrificing more. The important thing is that your baby receives quality care and a chance to bond and build attachment with both of his parents. Moms and dads play different roles in their babies' lives, so don't worry if one of you changes all the diapers while the other does most of the comforting. Your baby can benefit from both of your parenting styles. 
<P><I>For Mothers</I>: Take maternity leave if possible. Spend at least the first several weeks focusing on your newborn. Don't try to do too many other things. Consider hiring a doula to care for you (not your baby.) A doula's postpartum services include household chores or anything else that takes your energy away from your baby. Other helpers can do this job as well. 
<P>Some mothers feel reluctant to let their baby's father do his share of the baby care. If you feel this way, begin by doing basic tasks together such as bathing and changing diapers. Then pick out the tasks that you most need help with, and tell him exactly what you want him to do. He also needs the chance to learn to read and respond appropriately to your baby's cues. But, as always, don't act against your instincts just because you "think" you should. 
<P><I>For Fathers</I>: Take paternity leave if possible. You're responsible for caring for your new baby and his mother while they recuperate from the birth. Help around the house. Make sure your baby and his mother have everything they need. You also need to develop nurturing skills, so do your share of baby comforting, but don't take it personally if your partner doesn't want to give up the baby. Her instincts to protect your little one are very strong. 
<P>It's not uncommon for fathers to feel left out of the initial close attachment between their baby and his mother. Communicate your feelings to avoid building resentments that will harm your relationship and your abilities as a new parent. Be respectful and compassionate, and expect the same for yourself. Your partner's hormones are affecting her emotions. Tell her how you feel! 
<P><I>Sex</I>: After you give birth, your mothering hormones replace your sexual hormones. This is nature's way of insuring that your baby is cared for. For several months, and possibly not until weaning, you may not have the interest, or energy for, sex. Assure your mate that you still need him. Touch does not necessarily include intercourse, so you don't have to shy away from your partner's touch just because you don't want sex. 
<P>When you do feel ready for sex again, proceed slowly. You will probably experience vaginal dryness during the months after childbirth because the hormones that release a protective lubricant are at a lower level during lactation. Use a water-based lubricant to ease dryness. Take care with a partially healed episiotomy or tear. It is natural for your breasts to leak milk during sex. Experiment with different positions to avoid putting pressure on your perineum or breasts if they are sensitive. And always be prepared for the possibility of being interrupted by your baby's needs.</FONT></TD>

<P><FONT face=arial size=2>We all want to raise happy, healthy children, and we want to enjoy raising them. There is no one right way to reach these goals, because each child is different and each parent is different. The most important practice is to follow your instincts regardless of how your choices compare with anyone else's opinions on the best way to raise a child. If you desire guidance to help you through the vulnerable period of new parenthood, choose an approach, rather than a method, that you can use as a starting point to build your own parenting style. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial size=2>Go ahead and read a lot, and talk to other parents, but be sure to use your heart as well as your head when you consider the many arguments for different approaches to child rearing. It is possible for something to seem right, but not feel right at the same time. Beware of doing something "for his own good."</FONT>
<P><FONT face=arial size=2>Remember that because you know your baby better than anyone else, you are the expert on him. Never act against your instincts, because no method will <I>work</I> if you don't believe in what you're doing. And just because something appears to <I> work</I>  does not mean that is is good for your baby. Get to know your baby, stay close to him, and you will always know what to do. 
<P>The newer a parenting practice is, and the farther from nature's way, the more risk you take in practicing it, because it is experimental for our species. Beware of pseudoscientists who don't consider the needs and nature of children when designing parent-centered methods to make parenting more convenient. Your instincts are your instructions on parenting your specific child that are guaranteed to be the best for him. 
<P>"Attachment parenting" is a flexible approach that encourages modern parents to follow their instincts. In their books, <I>The Attachment Parenting Book</I> and <I>The Baby Book,</I> Dr. William and Martha Sears offer tips and tools for bonding and building attachment with your baby.
<P>Jean Liedloff's "<A href="http://www.continuum-concept.org/">continuum concept</A>" is a philosophy that explores the differences between humans raised the natural&nbsp;way and those raised by pseudoscientific methods. Her concept supports many attachment parenting practices such as breastfeeding, carrying your young baby, and sharing sleep. (Read <I>The Continuum Concept</I> by Jean Liedloff for more information on this instinctual approach to child rearing.)</FONT></TD>
