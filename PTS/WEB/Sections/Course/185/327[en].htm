<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Breastfeeding your baby is one of her transitions from your womb to the outside world. While inside, she was nourished by the umbilical cord, now she's nourished by your breasts and feels secure in your arms. Your voice and heartbeat are familiar comforts. Your milk, custom-made for her, contains all the nutrients she needs and is easily digested. It protects her from allergies, illnesses, and diseases, and aids in the optimal development of her brain and nervous system. 
<P>Breastfeeding your baby is good for you, too. While breastfeeding, you produce a high level of prolactin, the "mothering" hormone, which helps you balance the demanding nature of caring for a baby. Breastfeeding also prevents pregnancy, uses extra calories to help you get back in shape, and protects you from breast and ovarian cancers, urinary tract infections, and osteoporosis. 
<P>Take advantage of your baby's strong newborn sucking reflex by putting her to your breast as soon as possible after birth. If you wait, her sucking reflex may be weak for a couple of days.

<OL>
<LI>Sit or lie comfortably. Use pillows, footstool, or other props to support your arms, legs, or the baby if neccessary.&nbsp;(You won't always need these props, but they are helpful in the beginning.) 
<LI>Hold your baby at nipple level with her head and body facing you. 
<LI>Cup your breast with your hand. 
<LI>Tickle your baby's lip with your nipple. 
<LI>When she opens her mouth wide, center your nipple in her mouth above her tongue and pull her toward you so that your nipple is deep in her mouth with as much of your areola in her mouth as possible so she will suck effectively, compressing the milk sinuses to release the milk. 
<LI>Her chin presses into your breast and her nose touches your breast. If her nose seems blocked, pull her bottom in closer rather than pressing down on your breast. 
<LI>If you feel pain, stop and start over. Break the seal of her sucking by placing your finger in the corner of her mouth or by pulling back on her cheek. 
<LI>Nurse her for as long as she shows interest. When she slows and begins to doze, offer her the other breast. At each subsequent feeding, offer her the opposite (fuller) breast first. 
</OL>
<P>This first breastfeeding experience may feel awkward. Your baby may only nuzzle or lick. Don't worry if she doesn't latch on right away. The important thing is to hold her close, talk to her, and comfort her. Correct positioning and latch-on ensures that your baby sucks well, gets plently of milk, and protects your nipples from soreness. 
<P>Your first milk, called colostrum, is an important source of protective immunities against disease. Nurse her often, according to her signals, to develop an adequate milk supply. In the beginning, she nurses from every twenty minutes to every two hours. Her feedings will become further apart as she grows. 
<P>After your baby sucks for several minutes, you may feel a tingling sensation as your milk lets down. This occurs several times during a feeding. Even if you don't feel the let-down, you notice her swallowing more rapidly. 
<P>Hold your baby upright after she nurses. This often brings up any air bubbles. Pat or rub her back if she is fussy and seems to need to burp. If she burps, see if she wants to nurse again. If she falls asleep at your breast, it's not necessary to wake her to burp. </FONT></TD>

<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>Breastfeeding is a skill that takes practice to master. The following are common concerns during the learning process. 
<P><I>Foods and Medications</I>: Be mindful of what you eat as you did during pregnancy. Eat quality, high-nutrition foods and drink plenty of water. Foods that give you gas will also give your baby gas. Weat and dairy products are common causes of upset stomach.&nbsp;Avoid drugs and herbs that may be dangerous to your baby. 
<P><I>Colic</I>: Colic is often caused by foods that you eat. Foods that commonly upset your baby's stomach are dairy products, caffeine, grains and nuts, spicy foods, and foods that give you gas. When your baby experiences a colicky episode, think about what you ate and try avoiding it for a while to see if your baby gets better. 
<P><I>Nipple Care</I>: Use only water to cleanse your nipples. Soap will dry them out. If you experience soreness, make sure that your position and latch-on are correct. Dry your nipples after each feeding. You can apply a lanolin product, such as Lansinoh, to soothe and heal sore or cracked nipples. Wearing a bra can contribute to nipple soreness by flattening your sensitive nipples. 
<P><I>Sagging Breasts</I>: Breastfeeding does not cause your breasts to sag, pregnancy does. Your bigger, softer breasts are comforting to your baby. 
<P><I>Engorgement</I>: Hard, swelled breasts can be painful for you and can make it difficult for your baby to latch on to empty your breasts. Express or pump out just enough milk so your baby can latch on. Relieve the pain and swelling in your breasts by applying cold compresses. Don't use warm compresses because heat can increase tissue swelling. 
<P><I>Leaking Milk</I>: Unexpected leaking is usually only a problem during the early weeks. After your milk supply has stabilized, you may still leak a small amount from the opposite nipple while breastfeeding. You can wear disposable or washable breastpads in your bra to absorb leaking milk. Avoid using pads with plastic backing because they prevent air circulation and encourage bacterial growth. 
<P><I>Artificial Nipples</I>: Avoid giving your baby artificial nipples or pacifiers until breastfeeding is well established. Artificial nipples can interfere with his sucking technique and make breastfeeding more difficult. 
<P><I>Supplemental Fluids</I>: Avoid giving your baby supplemental water or formula. This will interfere with your milk supply. Breast milk production is a supply and demand system. If your baby misses a feeding, you won't produce as much milk next time. The more he drinks, the more you produce. 
<P>Giving formula to a breastfed baby may upset the balance of enzymes and nutrients in his digestive system and may interfere with the protective qualities your milk provides. 
<P><I>Pumping and Storing Milk</I>: Your baby can still receive your milk when you go back to work. Breastmilk can be refrigerated for a week or frozen for four months. 
<P><I>Biting</I>: If you feel your baby's teeth closing down to bite, pull him in close so his nose is covered and he will automatically let go in order to open his mouth and uncover his nose to breathe. Avoid shouting or pulling him away because he may be so alarmed that he stops breastfeeding for a few days. 
<P><I>Breastfeeding as Birth Control</I>: In order for breastfeeding to work as a contraceptive: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Feed your baby frequently according to his cues day and night. 
<LI>Avoid supplemental bottles and pacifiers. 
<LI>Delay solid foods until at least four to six months when your baby is developmentally ready. 
</UL>
<P>Most mothers who follow these practices are infertile for thirteen to sixteen months.

</TR><TR>
<TD colSpan=2>&nbsp;</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD vAlign=top><FONT face=arial size=2>You have several choices among formulas, bottles, and nipples. Try different ones until you and your baby are satisfied. Not all formulas are the same. Some are made with cow's milk, others with soy. Some contain whole proteins, others contain predigested ones. Some contain lactose and iron, others don't.&nbsp; Soy formulas should only be used if cow's milk cannot, because soy adversely affects the thyroid. (For more information on soy, visit <A href="http://soyonlineservice.co/nz">Soy Online Service</A>.) Formulas that contain predigested proteins may protect your baby from the&nbsp;complications associated with cow's milk protein, such as the development of Type 1 diabetes.
<P><I>Bottles</I>: Besides traditional glass or plastic bottles, there are plastic nursers with disposable bags that collapse as your baby feeds to reduce the amount of air he swallows. Try several different bottles until you find the one that fits you and your baby. 
<P><I>Nipples</I>: The standard bulb nipple best allows your baby to form a tight seal. The orthodontic nipple inserts farther into her mouth allowing natural milking action of her tongue, but requires that you keep the nipple turned correctly. The expandable nubbin nipple elongates while your baby sucks if her mouth is open wide enough and if she sucks hard enough. 
<P><B>Getting Started</B>:

<OL>
<LI>Prepare formula as directed on its container. 
<LI>To warm the formula, run warm tap water over it. Don't use the microwave because it heats unevenly and your baby could get burnt. 
<LI>Shake a few drops out onto your inner wrist to test the temperature. Milk should drip, not flow, from the nipple. It should drip at least one drop per second. 
<LI>While feeding, hold your baby close, look at her, and hold her bottle near your breast. Her head and body should be facing the same direction. Tilt the bottle up so the air rises to the bottom to prevent her from sucking in as much air. 
<LI>Stop feeding your baby if she falls asleep. As a general rule, feed your newborn to six-month-old two to two and one-half ounces per pound of her body weight (125 to 150 milileters per kilogram) each day. She won't drink as much at first. 
<LI>Immediately refrigerate unused formula for use within three hours. 
<LI>Hold her upright to burp. Place one hand on her belly and pat her back with the other. Or place her over your shoulder and pat her back. While breastfed babies don't always need to burp, bottle-fed babies usually do.
</OL>
<P>Because formula is more concentrated than breast milk, give your baby at least one bottle of water each day. (Breastfed babies do not need supplemental water, and probably should not have it.)
<P><I>Sterilyzing</I>: A dishwasher with 180 degrees Farenheit (82 degrees Celcius) water temperature will sterilize bottles and accessories. If you don't use a dishwasher, wash your equipment in hot soapy water and rinse in hot water. Boil your equipment for ten minutes in a covered pan. Place your equipment on a clean towell to dry. 
<P><B>Formula-feeding Concerns</B> 
<P>Formulas get better as new elements are discovered in breastmilk and imitated in formula, but no formula is a completely satisfactory replacement for your breast milk. It is an effective alternative for most babies as formula-fed babies appear to grow normally. However, formula&nbsp;does cause&nbsp;an allergic reaction in your newborn's intestines during the early months, and can be dangerous for some babies. For example, formula-fed infants have a greater risk of developing juvenile (Type I) diabetes. Formula-feeding has only been common for the past fifty years so it should still be considered experimental. We don't know all the long-term effects of being reared on formula. 
<P>Both cow's milk and soy, the common bases in formula, are&nbsp;common allergens. Formula doesn't change with the individual growth patterns of your baby as breastmilk does, and it doesn't contain illness and disease-fighting factors and digestive enzymes as breast milk does. The iron in formula is not as easily absorbed as the iron in breast milk. Sucking an artificial nipple uses different facial muscles than breastfeeding, and may affect swallowing development. </FONT></TD>
