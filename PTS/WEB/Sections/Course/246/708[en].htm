<H3 align=center><A name=in>Income</A></H3>
<P>The income section provides space for listing income received from any source. Included are salaries, wages, and bonuses from a job; investment income including cash dividends, interest, net realized capital gains, and rent; gifts; and other income. The line, <I>borrowed money</I>, is explained later under the section of this publication entitled <B><A href="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator/Favorites/g941%5B1%5D.htm#ni">Net Income</A></B>. Put down only income you are sure of receiving. Use blank lines for listing other types of income you may have.
