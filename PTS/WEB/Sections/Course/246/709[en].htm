<P>Expenses begin with taxes. Included here are all income taxes, Social Security payments, property taxes, and any other taxes. Use past records and current statements to get accurate figures. 
<P>Fixed obligations and financing expenses include payments for mortgage principal or rent payment, mortgage interest, automobile principal and interest, and all principal and interest payments on other debts. Payment amounts multiplied by the number of payments expected during the defined time period will give the amount to include. 
<P>Another subcategory of fixed obligations is insurance premiums. To project insurance payments, look at records for previous years and develop a figure for each premium, including a factor for inflation. 
<P>The next expense category is living expenses, including utilities, household operation and maintenance, equipment and furnishings, food, clothing, personal transportation, health and medical not covered by insurance, gifts and contributions, education, recreation and hobbies, entertainment, vacations, and miscellaneous expenses. 
<P>Be sure to include expenses specifically appropriate for your situation, such as child care and job-related expenses; support for someone who does not live with you; homeowner's association dues; care of clothing and household furnishings; parking fees; pet expenses; personal expenses such as grooming supplies or allowances for household members; and any irregular expenses such as equipment repair and replacement; fees for professional advisers; and pledges or subscriptions. 
<P>Past records of actual expenses plus an allowance for inflation can be used to develop actual numbers for the income statement.
