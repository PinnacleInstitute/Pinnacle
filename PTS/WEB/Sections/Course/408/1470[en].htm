<P>Chat can be fun! If you find a friendly chat room, you can become part of a larger group very quickly. Many forums have a chat or two tied to them. This is the place to exchange topic information quickly in a very friendly atmosphere. In fact it is so friendly, that many become chat addicted. Chat is a great way to talk with others online, but it should not become a substitute for your offline life.
<P>Like everything else chats have a unique set of rules. Most well run forums have at least one moderator or "mod" This is represented by the hammer by the mods name. The moderators role is to keep the peace and deal with problems as they arise. This is the person you go to if you are being bothered by unwanted messages, or if you are being attacked unjustly or stalked in that chat.
<P>If you need to speak with a mod, it is best in&nbsp;a busy room, to PM &lt;private message&gt; or whisper him/her. When we do our chat training, you will learn how to use this function. Using a PM&nbsp; lets only the person the message is sent to "see" it. No one else can.
<P>The moderator can, at his/her discretion, boot or kick someone from the room or gag them. Booting is the ejecting of a person from the room. Gagging mutes them so they can't be heard. Locking out or banning means the offender cannot access the room at all using his/her id.
<P>A good way to establish credibility with new chat mates is to fill out your profile. This includes your height, age, sex and other items, including a pic and your favourite quote. Trust and credibility have become a huge issue in most chats. There are individuals who create many different identities and prey on the vulnerable and weak. This harms all of us. When an erosion of trust occurs in a chat, it quickly dissolves friendships and causes suspicion and doubt. There are men and women&nbsp;who thrive on doing this. They see this as some sort of game they must win, at all costs. In fact, there are established "groups" of these individuals, who find it amusing to roam the net attacking forums, chats and sites. These internet terrorists are becoming a serious threat to us all. There are even "betting" groups, who play for money. The bet is on how close to causing someone serious harm, even death they can come. This isn't a new phenomenon, but is based on role playing games,&nbsp; carried out with real people.
<P>Here, as in the forums, heed your gut instincts. If an individual makes you uneasy back off. Ask questions of fellow chatters. Watch the individual closely. You will soon see by simple observation, what your instincts were telling you. If you find a person following you from chat to chat, and you have made it clear you want nothing to do with them, it can be considered stalking. If you feel you are being stalked online, you must document&nbsp; the time and place of each occurrence. You must keep pristine documentation in order to get help from the forum owners, law enforcement&nbsp;or from TOS.&nbsp;If you begin recieving e-mails from your stalker, save them and send them to <A href="http://www.fbi.gov/">www.FBI.gov</A>, and in long term stalking, to your local law enforcement agency..
<P>Many romances have developed in chat. But.. very very few, less than 1% are successful. The reason being is often one person takes the relationship far more seriously than the other.&nbsp; Cyber predators seek vulnerable needy partners for cybersex. This is a text version of sexual intercourse or other sex roles with another chatter. It is just as intimate to a sensitive caring person, as a real life encounter would and should be. The trouble is, these predators only seek gratification and another "hit", while the other sees this as somehow meaningful. Trust me, it's not in most cases. Don't have cybersex with anyone using webcams. Never send nude photos, or intimate photos to anyone online...ever. You can end up on a porn site and get yourself in serious trouble. You can become the victim of extortion or worse. If&nbsp; someone tells you they love you, they will find a way to see you in person. Too many men and women are strung along for years by a lover who doesn't knowthe truth from Adam. Most are married, but of course, hide that fact in chat. It's too easy to find someone needing love badly.
<P>Avoid giving out your exact location and telephone, e-mail or other real life information in chat. Don't share photos of children, grandchildren or your home. All this does is give a skilled predator an avenue&nbsp;for locating you. I recommend moving your exact location 20 or 30 miles away from your actual home. This keeps things at a much safer distance when dealing with unknowns on the net. Don't announce your marital status, unless you are married. If you are recently widowed or divorced&nbsp;I suggest stating you have a live in companion, or other relationship.
<P>Don't talk about your finances. Just like pedophiles, cyberpredators seek easy prey. They look for the lonely and needy&nbsp;who appear ready&nbsp;to take any form of abuse to feel loved. If you a have suffered some form of abuse or trauma, these chats are not the place to discuss them.
<P>There are plenty of private forums run by professionals and recovering victims, where these issues can be addressed in safety. I will place a few of them in the class netlinks for anyone needing their help.
<P>Chatspeak is a language all it's own. It is a series of acronyms designed to shorten time used in typing common words or phrases. Here is a short list. In your lesson links here is a complete chart of commonly used chat speak. Emoticons are the little smiley faces and other cute icons used in chat : A smile, a blue unhappy, an angry red, a winking smiley are all simple examples of an emoticon. They add colour and a little depth to your words, or rob a response of it's sting.
<P>When entering chat it's important to say Hi and greet others. If the chat is fast moving it's fine toi take a minute or to to adjust and see where things are headed before jumping in. Lurking is frowned on in chats. If you must leave your machine for a short while, simply state: I'll brb &lt;be right back&gt;. when you return, say either back or I'm back. Often a phone call or simply an unexpected guest will show up while you are in your favourite chat. You can simply post AFK &lt;away from keyboard&gt; with this after &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. This let's others know you are tied up. When you leave, say goodbye and if you are well known let others know you will be back. These courtesies count for alot in the chat world. It shows you care about others and marks you as someone who&nbsp; is considerate and friendly.
<P>Just remember, with a few precautions, chat can be fun and often informative. Solid friendships have developed in a good chat. Keep it's place in your life in perspective. This will allow you a relaxing time with people who share your concerns and interests. Chat isn't for everyone, but those that enjoy their little window into a much larger world, say it adds a richer dimension to their internet life.
