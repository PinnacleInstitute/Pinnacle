<P>Forums or message boards can add an extra dimension to your internet experience. If you have, for instance a family, scattered in different parts of the US or across the globe, a forum&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a great family meeting place. There members leave messages, swap recipes, news from home, photos and much more.Many families create their own genealogy forums, where newly found relatives can come and meet the rest of the clan.
<P>Or if you have a favorite hobby, there are usually many like- minded people gathered somewhere, just as passionate as you are. There are forums on everything from abuse to zxydeco. Simply go to the site index and search under a topic header for your personal interest.
<P>Parents and new Mom's seeking a little relief from parenting stresses will find many groups out there filled with others just like them. Gardeners have a huge range of choices on most of the bigger forum sites. As do pet lovers. Often just by breed alone, the selection is amazing.
<P>They are usually great places to ask questions or pick up handy hints on how to do something better or more cheaply. It can be a real delight, learning how other people across the globe do things differently from you.
<P>This gives us the opportunity to build small bridges of friendship between us and other nations. And this is why some forums are more successful than others. Showing an appreciation and a healthy curiosity about how other people live and do things is such a healthy thing for us.
<P>Yet there is a great deal of intolerance for this on the 'net. Many people bring preconcieved notions or outtright xenophobia&nbsp; with them on the boards. This creates a very hostile and unfriendly atmosphere. When you are scouting for a forum linked to your hobby or interest, take the time to read the posts. This will give you a good look at the people who visit there.
<P>Don't lurk. Lurking is visiting a place and not saying anything. This is considered a real breach of netiquette. Just drop in a friendly Hi!!&nbsp;I just dropped by to take a peek ,&nbsp;I liked your forum" note. This lets others know you at least have good manners. And believe it or not, manners are valued highly on the internet.
<P>Nowhere are manners more important than on the net. It is a flat medium in which the written word is king. For this reason, great care must be used when posting or even writing an e-mail. Many people are shocked to discover they have offended someone without meaning to. The way we phrase things becomes critical as to how we are seen by others.
<P>Phrases used in our offline lives may come off hostile sounding on the net.&nbsp; Look at the commonly used "Oh ok" Offline this may not be a hostile or unfriendly sounding phrase. But online it indicates a degree of indifference. "No" in response to a question, without a qualifier is insulting to many. A better response is "No, but&nbsp;I would like to learn more." Or "No, I usually don't go there because.." Just a quick little qualifier will spare you untold grief. The internet is really a tight knit community in some ways. And word of ugly or rude behaviour spreads fast.
<P>If you find yourself getting angry or upset over an opposing viewpoint or another's comments, don't respond in kind, or get insulting. Flaming is usually prohibited in better forums. A prudent thing to say might be "I see we agree to disagree, but that's alright" "&nbsp; I enjoy hearing your side of things" In this way, the online community sees you as someone they can deal with. In a bad situation, you are then likely to find support from your peers, if someome flames you or acts in a negative manner towards you.
<P>This all all people really "see" of you, your lines of words in a text box. So choose them with care. There are many old timers on the worldwide web who have become offline insensitive. They say that no one can get hurt by a few lines of text. This is incorrect and a warning to all of us.&nbsp; Words hurt, here online or off. Just because we can't "see" the person we are talking to, doesn't make them or their feelings any less real or immediate.
<P>If you run across an individual who feels this way, have some pity. They are so immersed in the internet, they have lost most feeling for "real" humanity" It is best to have limited contact with this type of individual. Usually, they are the thrill seekers of the net, always looking&nbsp;to recapture that initial feeling, and going deeper into the darker holes that populate the etherworld, in search of vicarious thrills. Which can include playing on &nbsp;someone's&nbsp; emotions.
<P>Please exercise caution in accepting files from fellow posters. Often there is malicious code embedded in the picture or file. Keep in mind that 80% or more of the folks you meet online have custom designed a fake persona, also called social engineering, to suit their own ends.
<P>The major forums all have their own TOS (Terms Of Service). Read them carefully, and if someone breaches those terms by attacking, disrupting or flaming you-even stalking you, report it. Take copies of the offending posts by using your Prt Scrn button over the post, then copy/pasting it into Word or an E-mail. This gives the abuse team, concrete proof of what you are alleging . Enlist willing supporting witnesses to do the same on your behalf.
<P>If you decide to open your own forum, if at all possible keep it private, and only allow members in you are certain can abide by YOUR TOS. Your TOS should be posted under the category: Forum Guidelines. If your forum will be public, then make this a Read Only post, and add the forum rules to your start page. This enables the abuse team to help you keep your forum trouble free. In your controls area, there should be a place to block offending user names with the click of a mouse.
<P>Don't appoint moderators to your forum, that you are not familiar with. And above all only grant control panel access to someone you personally know and trust. Too often, an untrustworthy mod can lock you out of your own forum. Make certain moderators are familiar with your rules and procedures. Stress they must be civil and courteous at all times. Remember, they are a direct reflection of you and your forum.
<P>Unless you plan on holding moderated, regular chats, disable the function entirely. Too often, empty open chat rooms become magnets for cyberlovers, looking for convenient nests. Don't leave that avenue open to abuse.
<P>Trust your first instincts with others you meet. Don't give out personal information to just anyone. And never assume that who you are talking to is what he/she claim themselves to be. If you meet someone and want to know them better, talk by phone a few times. This helps establish trust and credibility. With a little care and foresight, you can make your forum life a happy positive experience.</FONT></TD>
