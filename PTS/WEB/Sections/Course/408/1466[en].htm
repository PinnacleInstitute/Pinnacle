<P>This important tool is the key to your entire internet experience, yet many people only have a dim understanding of its role. This lesson will take you through the various tools and functions of your browser.&nbsp; You will also learn about the most popular&nbsp; browsers available. Internet Explorer, Netscape. Mozilla&nbsp;and Opera, which offers a text only surfing experience.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Where do you find your browser? Once you are connected to the internet, look up at the top portion of your screen. You will see a variety of icons and tools there. In your class net link section is a link to a graphic and text description of your taskbar. Study it well, for it is the key to your having fewer troubles with your internet.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>At the top, usually outlined in blue is your current location on the 'net. Underneath is a line of tools: File, Edit, View, Favorites, Tools and Help. Each as a unique function. Let's take a look at each one.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>File has several very important functions. From this area, you can&nbsp; send a message, make an internet call or post a text item.&nbsp; You can open a new or existing file, save a body of work as a My Documents entry or set up a page or send a link a memo or other item, using your Outlook Express, Eudora or Thunderbird&nbsp;e-mail interface. Go ahead and experiment with the various functions of File, until you are comfortable with it.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>The next item is Edit. This handy tool allows you to Copy/Paste items you wish to "move" quickly and easily. The "cut" function allows you to cut out areas of text or graphics you don't need or wish to use. Copy/pasting is very simple. Simply using your mouse, left click and by moving your mouse, highlight the entire area you wish to relocate. Then go up to Edit, click it open, click on copy and open the new area for your text, click on edit and then paste. Your item should appear there. Easy and simple! Even faster is to copy/paste from your keyboard!! Simply click on CtrlC and paste with CtrlV.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>View has many useful functions, but like the rest of your browser, is underutilized. From this area you can customize your toolbar, get a Tip of the Day,&nbsp; go straight to a currently visited web page, stop loading a site, refresh your screen and more. You can also take a look at your privacy and encoding settings,&nbsp;and adjust the size of your text.This is critical for minimizing eye strain or assisting with visual impairments.
<P>&nbsp;
<P>Favorites is the area where you "bookmark" your best sites, the ones you use daily or simply something you want to look at more deeply when you have the time. You can organize your "bookmarks" by topic, which can be a real timesaver, if your list is huge, like mine is.
<P>Tools is a critical area of your browser. Here permissions are set for websites, your homepage or opening page is selected and security settings are enabled. Clearing your browsers cache of old files, will keep your machine running faster and much more smoothly. Simply click on tools, click on internet options and in mid page is the delete temporary files button. Simply click, answer yes to the pop up prompt and once it is cleared, click Ok. If you visit multiple sites,&nbsp;it's a good idea to set your clear history button to 1 day. Delete cookies, will clear your browser of troublesome cookies that weigh your hard drive down. It is important for all internet users to understand each function in tools and use them properly.
<P>The help area has many sources for guidance and information about your browser. I want all of you to spend some time looking your toolbar over carefully and getting comfortable using it.
<P>The best known of the 3 is Internet Explorer, a Microsoft product, used by millions. Of the 3, it&nbsp;interfaces the best with most websites, and offers a reliable surfing experience. While there are security issues with much of Microsoft software, they are very quick usually, to offer patches and fixes, easily and safely.
<P>Netscape, another popular browser, offers a crisp clean interface, many users enjoy. The only problem with Netscape is that it doesn't always interface with game and graphics intensive sites well or at all.
<P>Mozilla offers a wonderful browser that uses a Linux based system, and is more secure than Windows. If you have enough RAM (Random Access Memory, you may want this a a second more secure browser on your system.
<P>Opera offers a graphics free browser, but it is tricky and tempremental. I personally do not recommend Opera for newbies, as it takes some skill to navigate with it.
<P>Taking the time to understand how your browser functions, it's various utilities and abilities, will make you a much more content and knowledgable voyager on the world wide web.
<P>Browser hijacking and BHO's are&nbsp;usually caused by spy/adware, inserted onto your computer, can create as much havoc as viruses. I recommend using a program like the free HijackThis, to keep your system clean of these malicious scripts.
