&nbsp;E-mail or electronic mail is a hugely popular feature with users. It allows us to quickly and easily communicate with family and friends&nbsp; across the globe. Yet we use this tool all too easily, without much thought or understanding of how it works.

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">This lesson will help increase your understanding of the ways in which electronic mail operates, and how to be a much wiser user. Which e-mail platform do you use? We will look at Outlook Express, Eudora, Thunderbird&nbsp;and web based mail.&nbsp;How to block spammers and the role porn plays in certain "innocuous" sites are an integral part of this lesson.</FONT>

<P>Microsoft developed the electronic mail platforms Outlook and Outlook Express. With this platform, from your tool bar and often from many websites, you can ask a question, write a webmaster or simply from your toolbar, send an e-mail. While many experienced users often operate without these tools, most newbie and intermediate users are better off using one or the other and adding a few select web based e-mails to their system.
<P>Eudora is another hugely popular e-mail platform. It is more secure, and many users find it a much better program to use, with lots of features and enhanced security. Since both these programs utilise a lot of space, only running one is strongly advised. If after looking both over, you decide to change, I recommend ridding your machine of the alternate program, to free up space on your hard drive. This is especially true for those of you with older, less storage enhanced computers. Both set up the same way, as you will see while doing your assignment. It's very much a matter of preference, concerning which one you ultimately choose. But understanding how they are to be set up is key to having a smooth e-mail system.&nbsp; Whole courses are devoted to this subject, and if you use your e-mail for business too,&nbsp;I recommend taking an additional course to be certain you are set up for optimal success.
<P>Mozilla's Thunderbird is free, quick and easy to install and set up. I use it and find it's almost flawless, and more secure.
<P>If you work online, or want your e-mails to be more private, I suggest getting a free encryption key PGP, and using it to encrypt your e-mails. Both sender and reciever should ideally possess keys for serious security, but it's simple and fast to set up.
<P>Spam is the unwanted, unsolicited sending of e-mail ads or messages to multiple users. It costs users hours of wasted time in deleting inboxes filled with these unwelcome mails. If caught, many times the offending site or person is blacklisted or outright banned from a website or program. Bottom line, don't send e-mails to people you do not know or who have not requested information from you. There are now many effective software programs that not only stop spammers cold, but report them. If you find yourself inundated by spam, I recommend using a program like Mailwasher or Spam Blocker. These are free downloads you can find through PC magazine.com or tucows.
<P>Mass forwarding of "cute" jokes or chain letters can really get other users, including your friends and family members upset. Don't do it. The biggest reason being is they eat up storage space on most e-mail servers. The other huge reason is the transmission of e-mail worms and viruses. Often the sender is totally unaware they are harming others, having had the hidden code implanted in their hard drive. There it sits like a ticking bomb waiting for the "trigger." Which often is embedded in an e-mail. Later, in another lesson, we will look at why having the best antivirus program you can afford is so critical to keeping your computer and your e-mails safe. Be aware that many people will not accept e-mails from anyone, which do not state they have been scanned by an anti virus program.
<P>Never open an attachment from someone you don't know. and because these worms and viruses are so cleverly coded, scan any attachment with your program first, just to be sure. If the subject line or header looks unfamiliar, strange or is blank, don't open it. Delete it and empty your trash. Using a web based e-mail like Excite can be of enormous help in blocking both spam and porn. If you decide to use web based e-mail accounts, look for ones like Excite, which offer spam blocking at the click of a button and spam reporting.
<P>Many parents are seeing a huge surge in porn e-mail in their inboxes, and are unsure how this could be happening. You need to be aware that many so called sports or game sites are run or sponsored heavily by the porn industry. If your children are heavily interested in WWF wrestling or gaming, chances are this is the source for your increase in porn e-mails. I was horrified to see a huge pop up ad on a WWF wrestling site my sons were visiting. Don't assume your children are safe using these sites. They're not. Another venue for porn are some of the so called freebie or shopping sites. Don't sign up for every offer that hits your inbox. When you do this, you are often opening a whole world of spam and porn.
<P>Pornography on the internet is a multimillion dollar business, with a huge following. Realistically speaking, it is an informed choice on behalf of the adults who use these sites. And, as it is an informed choice, not much will or should be done about mainstream porn. It is only when it infringes on your rights or the rights of your children to not be exposed to unwanted material, that it is an issue. I have included a couple of links to places where you can report child porn and the abuse of your privacy. Use them. The only way to stop this infringement is to be proactive.
<P>Graphics, especially photographs just hog hard drive space and really chew up the minimal storage space (3-5 megs), most web based e-mail providers offer. A much better option, is to either use a photo site like Snapfish or ofoto.com for storing your pictures. You can create albums there and then invite family and friends to go view them online. Yahoo also offers this service, though unless you pay to upgrade, the storage is small. All of these offer you a much better, more private and economic alternative to sending them by e-mails or taking up valuable hard drive space.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use your e-mail wisely. Create different accounts for different uses only if you get lots and lots of e-mails. You might have one strictly for family and close friends, one for business, and one for junk mail for example.&nbsp; By seperating your emails into categories like this, you create a much more focussed and efficient way to handle most of the problems that occur.
