&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things have changed vastly on the internet. Nowhere is this more obvious then in the area of viruses and trojans. As little as 3 or 4 years ago, the problem was kept within reasonable boundaries. Now these "bugs" have proliferated so quickly and spread so fast, software programmers are scrambling to keep their anti-virus, anti- trojan software updated.
<P>&nbsp; The main reason for the wildfire spread of worms like MyDoom, is carelessness on the part of many home pc users. People should take time to realise that, just like protecting your home and car, you must protect your pc and it's contents. You are the first line of defense in securing your pc.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsible pc owners take the time to arm themselves with as much knowledge as possible. The pc is a big investment still for many of us. So we owe it to ourselves to be as net savvy as possible.
<P>&nbsp; What exactly is a pc virus? The short answer is it is often a small cleverly written piece of coding, designed to disrupt and spread through many machines. One of the easiest transmission routes is e-mail. Believe it or not, certain websites may contain malicious code and by simply "viewing" a page, get a virus. Who creates these snippets of destruction?&nbsp; Anyone, from the high school geek to a seasoned cracker bent on damaging as many systems as he/she can.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Often these viruses come from overseas where in certain countries it is not considered a crime. This creates an enormous nightmare for law enforcement in Western democracies, who find themselves helpless to bring these people to justice.
<P>&nbsp; Trojans and worms are malware of a more serious nature. A trojan, with a well written piece of code, can seize control of your computer, log everything you do and back out leaving few obvious traces of his/her being there. These are commonly known as backdoor or sub 7 trojans. Both require a great deal of coding skill to create. These trojan codes are most often used to quickly steal information, or in some cases to intimidate and frighten users.
<P>&nbsp; One thing the home user may not realise is that law enforcement is stretched thin. Unless your damages exceed a certain dollar amount, usually $5,000.00, they are really reluctant to pursue your claims. Essentially, it is up to you, the home user to protect your investment.
<P>&nbsp; First, always use an anti-virus program 24/7. Ideally this program should include an active background e-mail scanner. Which program should you select? That depends both on your operating system, available memory and what you are really looking for in antivirus software. It is wise for any user to read reviews and take a good hard look at what's offered out there. Often the program that came with your pc is not the right one for the job. Still any protection is better than none.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use resources like zdnet or pc magazine to select the right program for your home computer. Some are free, though of course not as comprehensive in protection as any paid version. But, if money is an issue, using these free programs will afford you a great deal of protection. Avast is one of the best freeware anti-virus programs available.

<P>&nbsp; If you are connected to the internet through cable, dsl or fiberoptics, a firewall is necessary to defend against hackers. Random probes from anonymous machines, thousands of miles away, sit- sending out probes seeking open ports. This has nothing to do with you personally, and these events are not considered "attacks" in the true sense of the word. I personally recommend using a firewalled router, known as a "hardened" firewall, in addition to any software firewall. Especially if you do use an always on connection.
<P>&nbsp; Good software firewalls should have IDS: Intrusion Detection Systems, and utilise stateful packet inspection as well. Both these tools allow your firewall to "sniff" packets and monitor attempts at access.
<P>&nbsp; Often your own isp will send packets and probes to ensure your connection is operating correctly. Too often these things are seen as attacks by the novice firewall user.
<P>&nbsp; So then, what constitutes the sign of a genuine attempt to hack your machine?&nbsp; If, after eliminating the isp probes and random probes, you see the same dns number showing in your logs over and over again, this might indicate a more serious issue. You can run strange dns numbers at <A href="http://www.symantec.com">www.symantec.com</A> This will give you a few more details about where the probe is coming from. Or you can use the Whois databases to research ip numbers yourself. Other signs are sudden flooding of a port with a number of packets. This is known as a Syn Flood or DOS: Denial Of Service attempt. A good firewall has the ability to configure rules to stop this from happening.
<P>&nbsp; Signs of possible trojan activity in your machine are:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sudden pulling or lagging in your keystrokes.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inexplicable refusal to obey keyed commands
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New or unrecognised files that weren't present before. Often when you try to open the strange file, your machine will crash.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emptied folders or inboxes- these appear to have been magically erased.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes others will write you, asking why you were at a certain site, behaving in a certain way, yet you know you were nowhere near there at that time.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or friends recieve strange, insulting or out of character e-mails "claiming" to be from you. This is very serious, as identity theft is becoming more common on the 'net.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your hard drive engages for no apparent reason.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are suddenly denied administrative privileges on your system. This means usually someone has taken root control of your machine. At this point, You must wipe your hard drive, offline and disconnected from the web, and doing a safe offline reinstall of all security programs.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These may be signs of an intruder in your system. There are some excellent programs out there to help minimise hacker attacks.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are freeware, others are priced online at around 20-40 dollars. One of the better ones is Kerio Personal firewall, available as freeware or in the Pro edition, at around $30.00
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take some time and shop around for a firewall that operates quietly and easily in the background, and doesn't send out annoying noises or pop ups every time you access a site. Be aware that the new user friendly GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces}, can be exploited by hackers who are intent on using your machine. By using keyboard hooks, they hook onto your DLL (Dynamic Link Library), and gain access. To minimise this risk, don't use the auto configuration tools if at all possible. Use custom, and set your permissions manually. It's not difficult, and will make you more secure.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, learn to set your firewall up correctly. Take the time to read over any tutorials, FAQ's and additional information before running your software. These additional steps will ensure you have a program that operates at maximum efficiency, and requires little to no effort on your part
