<P>Shopping online is a fun safe and often very rewarding experience! You can buy online 24 hours a day from the comfort of your own home. And believe it or not it's safe, when you shop well known merchants like Eddie Bauer, Macy's or Lands End. Most sites offer Verisign, BBB online and secure sockets layering for encrypted ordering. Look for the logos on the sites opening page, if you have any doubts about placing an order. Look for sites who offer customer support with either live online advice or a toll free number. Often calling the staff, will help allay any concerns you might have, plus.. you can always give them your credit card information by phone. One of the most important things to remember about online shopping is to be aware of the merchants offline presence. Are they well known? Do they have a fair return and shipping policy? Two great online resources you can check are www.BizRate.com and www.epinions.com. At both these sites, consumers rate both the site and the merchandise. This can be very helpful, if you are planning a big online purchase. I routinely use both and have found their help to be invaluable to my online shopping experience. Most if not all stores offer wish lists. These are handy little tools, that your loved ones can use to see what you most want for Christmas, a birthday or anniversary. It's also great if you're preplanning some shopping for yourself or others. As an adjunct to the shopping sites, there are greeting card sites that offer a wonderful array of nice tools to help bring family and friends a little joy. For a nominal fee, you get an address book, a birthday reminder notice for everyone in your family, plus a great selection of e cards and print your own greeting cards. If that weren't enough, the best ones offer a nice array of thoughtful gifts you can include with your greeting. Here is a list of my personal favorites: www.flavia.com www.americangreetings.com www. bluemountainarts.com One of the very best shopping sites is www.Amazon.com What a site! They have a huge collection of books, cd's, dvd's and products from merchants like Target, Old Navy, Lands End and so many more. I love this site, which you can personalise and be as interactive with as you wish. You can review products, merchants, books and even recommend things to other readers. Ordering with them is smooth fast and easy. I highly recommend them. Bookmark this one, its a safe fun place to shop! 
<P>Don't let the lack of a famous brand name stop you from exploring smaller lesser known sites. Some of these are fantastic, offering you the finest products on the net. As a part of this lesson I will be asking you to research 5 little known "boutique" sites, and offering me your personal evaluation. How will you go about finding them? Think of something you want badly and go to www.google.com and type the name in the search box and hit go. Usually, the third or 4th choice will be a boutique offering. Explore the world of online shopping. Start small by purchasing a book or cd and let yourself become familiar with a sites ordering and shipping. One word of warning, just as it is offline, joining book of the month or any "of the month" type programs can cause you no end of grief. Unless you have the time to make sure you comply with their terms and conditions, its best to avoid this type of committment. And remember every month your credit card is billed, it's compounding your interest and balance.
<P>Identity theft is a major crime online. Since most of us bank, pay bills and shop here, it pays to only patronise sites carrying the ETrust, Verisign and BBBOnline logos. If they use HTTPS in addition, you can be reasonably assured it's safe. Most responsible stores carry these logos. Don't ever give out your password or banking information by e-mail. Call and verify that the request is valid and do it by phone.
<P>Fall is ideal for pre- Christmas shopping. Just think! No crowds, great prices and best of all, you get it all done months ahead of time, leaving your season free to relax and enjoy family and friends. Crabtree and Evelyn, Caldwell Massey, Rogers et Gallet and Woods of Windsor, all offer simply lovely soaps, bath baskets, gels and creams, sure to delight and pamper the lucky recipient.
<P>Gardeners can be treated to beautiful gifts from Jackson Perkins, Chefs Garden and Whiteflower Farms. Many bulb merchants like McLure and Zimmerman, offer rare and antique bulb, while the Antique Rose Emporium offers some simply breathtaking old roses at great prices!
<P>Take the time to go bargain hunting at places like Bargain.com or Shop.com. They really have some good deals on well known merchandise, at rock bottom prices. Always check out the sale pages at merchants like LandsEnd.com, EddieBauer.com, and LinensnThings.com. I've found sonme real goodies there.
<P>Take advantage of the wonderful stores and the ease of shopping online this season. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at just how much you save by shopping the net
