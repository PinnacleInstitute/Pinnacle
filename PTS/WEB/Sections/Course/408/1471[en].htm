<P>Instant Messengers or IM's are an accelerated form of communication. Most often the dialogue is between 2 people in a small pop up window. This handy tool can perform many more functions than just chatting however.
<P>Family and friends with the use of&nbsp;a webcam, can watch a baby's first steps, see a new pet, or just look at a loved ones face while chatting.
<P>You can also send a photo&nbsp; using the send file function, or some interesting article, in seconds. Many users don't realize you can send e-mails or make phone calls from many IM's. With the click of your mouse you can open a chat room for a group, or simply leave I'll bbl later messages, or a quick note to someone offline.
<P>The IM you select is truly a matter of preference. AOL and Netscape users have access to AIM, the AOL instant messenger. This one has been around for a long long time, and is used by millions of happy chatters. If AOL is your ISP, then the use of AIM comes with your package. If you're not an AOL user, you can still get AIM, by signing up for the free e-mail at <A href="http://www.netscape.net/">www.netscape.net</A>.&nbsp; Once logged in, you'll find the get AIM button in the upper right corner of your Netscape inbox. AIM is a great first IM for newbies with its easy to use simple interface.
<P>ICQ &lt;I seek you&gt;,&nbsp; is another enormously popular IM. With over a million users, and two versions: Full and Lite, you can't beat the features this great IM offers. In addition to all the great IM perks, ICQ also has a vast community message board and chat system. Along with AIM, ICQ is very stable and rarely causes conflicts with your pc.
<P>Yahoo Messenger is by far the most colorful. It offers a huge range of emoticons, plus really fun backgrounds for your IM window. You can choose from a peaceful aquarium or a Precious Moments background, just to name two from their available&nbsp;options. All three of these IM's are full featured. They offer voice, webcam and phone capabilities, along with the file transfer and more. All are free and well worth looking into.
<P>Pal Talk is another very well liked choice with all the features of the others. It has a couple of drawbacks the first 3 don't. First, in order to be ad free, you must subscribe and pay a fee. Second, many users complain about it locking up their pc's and the intrusion of unwanted visitors into their chats. For myself, this was reason enough to uninstall it.
<P>Most instant messenging systems can be firewalled, which is critical to your safe use of them. ICQ has numerous Trojan horse programs, created by skilled crackers, to breach your computer. Don't use any IM, unfirewalled. If it can't be firewalled, don't use it. Always, when through using your IM, exit it off your system tray. This makes it more difficult to exploit. Any messages will be waiting when you need to bring it back up. 
<P>Don't share photos and files with anyone through IM that you don't know personally and trust. Period. This is the fastest way to get inside your root access area. It's just not worth the risk. Once you choose your IM system, configure it as not public and confine it to close friends and family. Don't accept IM's from people you don't know. The best way to avoid this, is to not have your details filled out, and block it from public listing. 
<P>&nbsp;AOL offers Parental Controls on Chat And IM. Set these up for your children, and restrict their access. They are too vulnerable to the very skilled predators lurking around.&nbsp; View their buddy lists from time to time, and ask questions about the people on it, especially if new names pop up. It's your job to safeguard your children. 
<P>For very private messenging, you might want to use a private IM applet. Many are free, and are restricted to only you and very few others. This makes them ideal for quick exchange of information, in a bit more secure environment.
<P>Until we are offered encrypted IM's, it pays to be very aware that these are very non- secure ways to communicate with the virtual buddies you've made. Are you aware that placing calls, either cell or regular, through IM's is high risk? It is. Again, it's too easy for a dedicated hacker to exploit your computer. Use your phones in the normal way and avoid internet calling.
<P>What signs are there that someone may be trying to exploit your IM? Look for extended silences, and long BRB's from the other end. If you start noticing a regular pattern of this, disconnect the messenger. Often the silences indicate someones programming trojans, worms or viruses into your root system. Another might appear to be a string of gibberish symbols, with the user exclaiming "OMG what just happened???" Those gibberish like symbols are code, and that code was just sent straight into your computer. Or someone social engineers an angry confrontation using multiple symbols and letters. If you see this..&nbsp; disconnect.
<P>By now you're probably thinking, if they are that unsafe, why use them? Fair question. IM's should be restricted to a Trusted Zone of users, mainly close family and co- workers you've met. This narrows down the chance an unknown user can access your system. The only way to be safe using any tool online is to become thoroughly familiar with how they work and their weaknesses. Read ratings on the different messengers by users, and pay close attention to mention of system instability or exploits.I found out that the 60 odd trojans on my computer originated through ICQ based hacking. Experience is the best teacher in most life situations, but when you spend over $1700. for a computer, that's a costly error. It cost me two years of work and pain to get back online safely. I hope by teaching this class to spare most of you this sort of experience.
