<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Over the last five years there has been a major shift of recruiting resources. Most positions open to the general public are now posted on one or more internet locations including company web sites, job boards, newspaper web pages, and association web sites. Five to ten years ago the most used recruiting resources were journal/newspaper advertising and contingency recruiters. Now advertising is in a distant second position and recruiters a very distant third.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>No reasonably successful career search can be managed without the ability to surf the www and send documents or messages via email. In similar fashion to all aspects of the search process, don’t over rely on any one or two internet services. Use all or most of the following channels:</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>JOB BOARDS</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The largest and most used sites are </FONT><A href="http://www.monster.com/"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>www.monster.com</FONT></A><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>, </FONT><A href="http://www.hotjobs.com/"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>www.hotjobs.com</FONT></A><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>, </FONT><A href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>www.careerbuilder.com</FONT></A><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>. Also, most professional associations will have jobs posted on a career center page. In all cases, the career search candidate can store a resume and cover letter in the site data base and respond to posted positions using the stored information. The critical skill needed is the ability to cut and paste a document from hard drive to data base. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Often an email address will also be specified in the posting which will allow the candidate to send an email cover message with an attached resume. Once the ability to attach a document is learned the distribution process is very simple and efficient. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The best source for opportunities is direct access to the Company web site and many companies now have a career page where you can search open positions. Usually the candidate can upload their resume to the site and apply for positions on line. There will be times when the company data base is outdated and requires building the resume. Individuals can choose to skip these companies but if the position is very attractive it may be worth the added time required.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>ADVERTISEMENTS</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>For years this was the primary method used to broadcast opportunities and most newspapers now link to a web site. The vast majority of ads now list an email address along with a mailing address and fax number. Email remains the most efficient method for sending a resume but a fax may get more attention because most career searchers prefer using email.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Remember that the key to posting or ad responses is the cover message which targets the specific requirements and a generic very marketing oriented resume. With a well crafted cover message there is no need to tailor the resume for each opportunity.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>EXECUTIVE SEARCH FIRMS</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Most search firms work as recruiting consultants for company clients and usually work on relatively few very senior, high level positions at any specific time. It is rare when a client will use a search firm to fill a position below the Vice President or Director levels where salaries tend to be in the six figure range.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is very important to understand that the reason for the “search” in the label is that the firm is exploring very specialized avenues to identify potential candidates. They seldom post the position on a job site or run an advertisement. The client pays a significant retained fee to the search firm “up front” so the client can receive highly individualized service.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Developing search firm relationships is a long range effort and mass mailing based on the immediate need to find opportunities is very unproductive. Take phone calls, get your name in the paper or journals and devote much attention to continuous networking. This increases the prospect that search research will identify the individual as a prospect or the search recruiter will be referred by friends and associates to the career search candidate.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Also, have networking contacts refer you to search recruiters they know as a further source of introduction. This long term relationship building effort pays off when a need to explore opportunities becomes active. Remember, that this channel only taps roughly 2% of potential opportunities.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>CONTINGENCY RECRUITERS</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>These recruiting companies receive a fee from clients when they successfully place a person in an open position. They really act as a “match maker” between people looking for opportunities and employers and continuously build their data base of possible candidates and available open positions. Employers use this recruiting resource most frequently to gain candidates for entry to mid level positions in the $20-80,000 range.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The optimum way to use this channel is to seek recommendations from career consultants or colleagues on quality firms. Periodically give a few recruiters an opportunity to assist you and narrow your choices to 3-4 in any target region. Then send you resume and set up a meeting to review your background and the types of clients they support. Then wait for them to contact you and don’t waste time staying in close contact with them other than a brief update every 4-6 weeks indicating you are still in the market for opportunities. If they have a possible match they will be “hot on your trail”.</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is clear that “developing opportunities” is the bottom line of any career search effort where the most critical skills are applied to generate career exploration success. It is very important to stay focused and highly organized. The “critical success factors” are:</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Set weekly stretch objectives for the search effort and regularly assess accomplishments.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Track activity daily including people contacted, information sent and follow up needed.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>View all search efforts as a skill building “work-in-progress” and utilize every opportunity to evaluate and apply feed back and results.</FONT>
