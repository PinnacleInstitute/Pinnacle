<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>You have now reached the phase of your quest that reinforces the efforts expended throughout this career search and evaluation process. As emphasized, the goal has not been to just get a job, but to find the opportunity that promotes maximum “career fit” and achieve long range career success! When an offer is received, it is very important to maintain enthusiasm and begin this final, critical evaluation phase.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is very important that the strategic approach developed be continued by avoiding a highly reactive, premature response. This can be accomplished through a review of your career search strategy and all options that have been developed. The information gathered and possible opportunities developed should be evaluated and prioritized. This review includes the matching of options with needs, skills, career goals, opportunity for success and career satisfaction. Every effort should be made to gain as many viable opportunities as possible to maximize leverage and viable choices.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It is also critical that the management of the process ensures that each interesting opportunity time line be coordinated as closely as possible so that most of the top choices become viable within a two to three week decision range. Delaying or accelerating techniques need to be employed during the period leading to the decision phase. Even if this is not fully accomplished, most important information will have been gathered to facilitate the “precise fit” decision in a timely fashion.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Make sure that you clearly understand the time range available for a decision on each offer received. When the offer is verbal, determine when and how a written offer will be received. The final program module will provide the decision model to support the evaluation ad decision making process. This module is designed to ensure that a full range of decision factors are reviewed and understood.</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>It will be very helpful if the self assessment completed is revisited to reinforce the values, work preferences, personal and professional needs identified. The following list of factors are not meant to be all-inclusive but should facilitate a complete review:</FONT>
