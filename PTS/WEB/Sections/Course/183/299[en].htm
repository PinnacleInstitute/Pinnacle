<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>CRITICAL ASSESSMENT DETAILS</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Summarize a self portrait of career values, positive work experiences, career goals and the factors that are most important for selection of any career opportunity. This will ensure that each of us will be able to respond to the call, “ know thyself”.

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Develop a brief snap shot of the detailed career strategy that specifies top priority career path options. The finished product should be brief, all inclusive and very easily remembered and used as a 15 second “sound bite” introduction that captures the essence of individual career vision and mission. Visualize the statement as a career umbrella that demonstrates diversity and clear connectivity between options. This picture creates a clear perception that the individual exploring career opportunities can cover several career bases on a well defined “playing field”. For example:</FONT>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Most presenters prefer to use an outline to guide their presentation and the resume fills this need very well. In order to present successfully, the following preparation steps should be followed:</FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Research the target company</I></B>- The more information assembled about the prospect such as products, finances, mission, values and competition, the better are the possibilities for presentation success. Information sources include annual report, web site, marketing materials and press releases. Determine if networking contacts have inside information or can act as a referral source to those who have valuable information.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Gather information on the position</I></B>- Determine key position requirements, departments or other roles that provide valuable support, critical success factors, how long others have stayed in the position and their career growth. Most importantly, get some sense of day to day activities.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Determine information gaps</I></B>- Demonstrate the research completed by asking practical, probing questions on future goals, why key past decisions were made, plans for growth and work environment. Focus on areas that will lead to success or pitfalls that could cause failure. Other critical information includes department plans, past success, reputation and leadership style.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Complete presentation strategy</I></B>- Each interviewer has a goal to determine which candidate can best fulfill the needs of the position. They will verify information included on the resume to ensure that each candidate possesses key functional skills and determine match to the supervisor’s style and priorities. Once critical skills have been evaluated, chemistry/style is matched to overall organization attributes. Skill gaps or areas where mismatches exist will usually be translated into a candidate ranking. Prepare methods to gain information from the interviewer during the opening phase of the discussion and develop rapport with each person met. Develop the ability to calmly ask questions after answering initial questions asked (e.g., When did you move to this area? Respond and ask the interviewer the same question in similar fashion.)</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Remain positive and flexible</I></B>- Never make negative statements about past managers, associates or employers and when asked a question concerning difficult or problem situations, briefly answer the question and then describe the positive aspects of the situation. For example, if asked to describe the most difficult person you ever dealt with, briefly describe the circumstances and how you successfully resolved the difficulty. Also prepare to answer questions concerning salary expectations. Indicate that you are flexible and need to learn more about the organization and position to respond. If pressed, simply turn the tables by saying, “I am flexible and could you give me the range for this position”? </FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Finalize plans</I></B>- Be prepared to illustrate ways that you will add value to the enterprise by describing examples of your accomplishments that match critical position challenges.
