<H4 class=title>PART 2 - BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF THE MEMBERS AND COMMISSIONERS OF THE U.S. BOARD OF PAROLE AND U.S. PAROLE COMMISSION</H4><H5>A. OVERVIEW</H5>
<P>Sixty-three men and women have served as Members/Commissioners of the U.S. Board of Parole/U.S. Parole Commission. There have been fifty-one men and eleven women appointed. Their backgrounds have included law, medicine, law enforcement, institutional corrections, probation and parole, education, social work, and business. 
<P>From 1930-1950, federal parole board members were appointed by the Attorney General. Originally, the Board of Parole had three members. In 1945, two additional members were appointed. 
<P>Beginning in 1950, federal parole board members were appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate for six-year, staggered terms, and their number was increased to eight. At the end of his or her term, a member who had not been reappointed would continue to serve until his successor had been appointed and qualified. In the case of a vacancy, an appointment filling the vacancy would be for the unexpired portion of the term.
<P>In 1976, the <I>Parole Commission and Reorganization Act</I> increased the number of federal parole board members (now called Parole Commissioners) to nine, and changed the provisions governing their terms in two respects. First, it provided that future appointments would be for full, six-year terms, effective on the date the appointee took office. Second, it provided that no person could serve a total of more than twelve years as a Parole Commissioner.
<P>The<I> Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984</I> extended the terms of Parole Commissioners holding office on the date of the taking effect of the sentencing guidelines (November 1, 1987) for an additional five years (until November 1, 1992) and removed the twelve-year limitation on total service as a Parole Commissioner. The <I>Judicial Improvements Act of 1990</I> extended the terms of the Parole Commissioners holding office on November 1, 1987, by an additional five years (until November 1, 1997). 
<P>The <I>Parole Commission Phaseout Act of 1996</I> reinstated the twelve-year limitation on total service as a Parole Commissioner. It also provided for the reduction in the number of Parole Commissioners to two Commissioners on December 31, 2000, and to one Commissioner on December 31, 2001.
<P><I>The National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997</I> increased the authorized size of the Parole Commission to five Commissioners.
<P>Subpart B lists the Members/Commissioners of the U.S. Board of Parole/U.S. Parole Commission by dates of service. 
<P>Subpart C provides a brief biographical sketch of each Member/Commissioner. <H5>B. LIST OF MEMBERS/COMMISSIONERS BY DATES OF SERVICE</H5><H5 class=title style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Dates of Service</H5>
