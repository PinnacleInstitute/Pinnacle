Like going to the playground or learning how to drive a car, using the Internet can be a lot of fun. In both instances, though, it's important to know and follow some basic safety rules.
<BR>
<BR><B>Basic Safety Rules</B> One important thing to keep in mind is that children are very trusting and don't necessarily realize that not matter how "friendly" their online acquaintances are, they're not really "friends" at all! You've never met them, you don't even know their real names, and you have no way of knowing if they are who they say they are! 
<BR>
<BR>Tell your children never to agree to a face-to-face meeting with an online acquaintance without a parent's consent. If a parent agrees to the meeting, bring them along. 
<BR>
<BR>Teach youngsters not to reveal anything online that they wouldn't share with a stranger on the street. If they're not sure if it's appropriate to share something, let them know that it's O.K. to say "no" for the time being and check with a parent or another trusted adult before you respond. 
<BR>
<BR>It's not possible to protect children and teens from all inappropriate material online. Parents need to keep the lines of communication open. Surf the Internet with your children. Ask them about where they have been online and what they think and feel about what they have seen while surfing. Just because something is posted on the Internet, doesn't necessarily make it true or reliable. Children and teens should discuss what they are viewing online with a parent to learn how to evaluate what they are seeing online and then decide if it is valid information or not. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Talking to Your Children About the Internet</B>
<BR>
<BR>The first thing is to sit down with your child and find out what they already know about the Internet, why they think it's important to know about online safety rules, and whether they have ever been made uncomfortable by something they have seen online. Explain that you are there to help them and if you don't know the answer to a question or concern that they have, you will find out for them. 
<BR>
<BR>Describe some scenarios to teach your children about Internet safety. For example, you could talk about a situation where someone has sent your child a photograph and has asked that your child do the same. Ask "What would you do?" and give him or her the opportunity to answer
<BR>
<BR>In this case, the <I>right</I> answer is that you are not to send photos unless it's someone you know personally. (This could be someone from school, a sports team, or another recreational activity.) Photos should <B>never</B> be sent without a parent's permission. 
<BR>
<BR>Here's another scenario: 
<BR>
<BR>An online acquaintance sends you a link to check out. When you click on it, you see that it contains nudity, racist comments, or pictures/descriptions of violent acts. What do you do? 
<BR>
<BR>In this case, the <I>right</I> answer is to log off the computer and tell your parents. If that individual tries to contact you again, do not respond. Use the blocking function in your e-mail software to block incoming messages from that e-mail address, if necessary. Parents, you need to discuss how your child feels about what he or she has seen. You will also want to try to explain to your child why someone would try to "trick" him or her like that, even if the only explanation is "I don't know why they would do that, but that person certainly isn't a friend".
<BR>
<BR>Let's look at one more scenario: 
<BR>
<BR>A friend confides to your child that he or she has received a disturbing e-mail or has been sexually solicited by someone online. What would you do? 
<BR>
<BR>In this case, the <I>right</I> answer is to tell your friend to immediately tell his/her parents. In this situation, the young person needs the help of a trusted adult. 
<BR>
<BR>Rehearsing what to do in situations your child might run across is an effective way of teaching children about safety rules. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Put it in Writing</B>
<BR>
<BR>Just as parents can sign a contract with respect to Internet use, here is some sample wording for a contract children and teens can sign. You might want to post this by the computer. 
<BR>
<BR>Contract for Internet Use for Children/Teens
<BR>
<BR>1. I understand that using the Internet is a privilege and that I need to follow family safety rules in order to be allowed to go online. 
<BR>
<BR>2. I will keep personal information private. This includes my real name, address, phone number, school, city, and name of any sports team I am a part of. 
<BR>
<BR>3. I will not provide any financial information, including credit card numbers, to anyone online. 
<BR>
<BR>4. I will not share my password with anyone but my parents. 
<BR>
<BR>5. I will not send anyone a photograph of myself without my parents' permission. 
<BR>
<BR>6. I will not agree to meet any of my online "friends" without my parents' knowledge.

<BR>Now that we have covered basic Internet safety rules and how to discuss them with young people, the next step is to look at safety when using e-mail, bulletin boards, and chat rooms.
