<B>How to be a Web-savvy Consumer</B>
<BR>
<BR>Internet shopping is big business. You can probably purchase anything online you can buy in a retail store, but the Internet is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. And you can shop from any computer with Internet access! 
<BR>
<BR>Before you start making purchases online, you do need to keep a few things in mind. 
<BR>
<BR>Get to know a bit about the online retailer. Find out where they are located and if they provide an address and phone number on the Web site. 
<BR>
<BR>If you have any questions about the merchandise you are buying, ask them prior to purchase. It's a lot easier to find out before you buy than to try to return an item that isn't what you wanted. 
<BR>
<BR>Find out about the online merchant's return policy. Will they take an item back? If so, does the item have to be in the original packaging? Is the original shipping charge refundable? 
<BR>
<BR>What personal information do you have to provide in order to make a purchase? What does the merchant do with this information? Find out about the company's privacy policy. 
<BR>
<BR>When you are ready to make a purchase, be sure that the browser is secure. You can tell whether or not you are on a page that is secure if the url has changed to https://www.nameofsite.com from http://www.nameofsite.com. A closed padlock may appear at the bottom of your browser window. You may also get a pop-up message stating that you are on a page that is secure. 
<BR>
<BR>When your purchase has been completed, be sure to print off a copy for your records. 
<BR>
<BR>If you have a problem with a merchant that you are unable to resolve, you can contact the Better Business Bureau online for help. You can also check out a company before doing business with them. Contact them at http://www.bbb.org With reports on over 2 million businesses and charities, the BBB is a great source of information.

<BR><B>What is Cyberstalking?</B>
<BR>
<BR>Cyberstalking is computer-age stalking. It is repeated, unwanted contact from an individual using the Internet and/or e-mail. This can take the form of the cyberstalker frequenting Web sites, newsgroups, and chat rooms the victims posts on, conducting research to find out about the victim's personal life (both online and offline), posting messages about the victim online, and repeated e-mail messages to the victim. Some offenders will develop a Web site to post information about the victim; still others will hack into a victim's computer or impersonate that person online. When this behavior reaches the point that the victim is fearing for his or her personal safety, it has crossed the line from harassment to cyberstalking. 
<BR>
<BR>Both men and women have been victims of cyberstalking, but women between 18-24 years of age are most at risk. In the majority of cases, there had been no prior contact between the cyberstalker and the victim prior to the start of the stalking. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Cyberstalking and the Law</B>
<BR>
<BR>Under U.S. law, most states have enacted legislation to deal with crimes in cyberspace. These laws vary from state to state with respect to what cyberstalking is and whether the offense is misdemeanor or a felony. Federal laws are also on the books with respect to interstate stalking and using telecommunications devices to harass or threaten an individual. 
<BR>
<BR>In Canada, the Criminal Code prohibits an individual from "criminally harassing" another. It also sets out penalties for anyone conveying false messages about another individual by phone, letter, radio, telegram, etc. 
<BR>
<BR>In Great Britain, the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 prohibits anyone from behaving in a way that causes another person distress. The Malicious Communications Act 1998 sets out penalties for sending messages that are offensive, threatening, or false using electronic means. Under the Telecommunications Act 1984, anyone using a "public telecommunication system" for the purpose of broadcasting such messages can be imprisoned for up to six months or ordered to pay a fine. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Protecting Yourself from Being Harassed Online</B>
<BR>
<BR>Do an online search for your name on Google or one of the other search engines. You can also search for images or references to yourself in news groups. Be sure to check your phone number (including area code) as well. This will let you know if you are being cyberstalked without your knowledge. 
<BR>
<BR>If you want to post to newsgroups online, get a free e-mail address. Choose a screen name that doesn't include your real name. Give your primary e-mail address to family and close friends only. 
<BR>
<BR>The basic rules of Internet safety apply here as well. Keep in mind that people you are meeting online may or may not be who they claim to be. Do not reveal any personal information and if you are required to complete a profile, answer only the required questions, no more. 
<BR>
<BR><B>What to do if You Are Being Cyberstalked</B>
<BR>
<BR>The first thing to do is to tell the stalker to stop contacting you. Be clear and direct. 
<BR>
<BR>Cyberstalkers are looking for attention; do not respond to any messages the harasser sends. 
<BR>
<BR>Report the harassment to the stalker's Internet Service Provider. If you are being contacted via instant messages, you need to change your ID and nickname. Give your contact information for instant messaging only to those persons you trust; ask them not to pass it along to anyone else. 
<BR>
<BR>Make sure any online profiles you fill out do not contain any personal information. There may be some required fields, but do not have to provide any information that is not required. 
<BR>
<BR>Be sure to keep log files of any instant messages received from the stalker. You should also save any e-mail messages received (and your replies) as evidence. 
<BR>
<BR>If you feel that you are in physical danger from the stalker or if the stalker has indicated they know where you live, contact local police immediately! 
<BR>
<BR>Now that you have read this lesson, you can shop online with confidence and you know what to do if you are the recipient of unwanted attention from other Net users. 
<BR>
<BR>Keep in mind that the Internet's benefits outweigh the dangers. 
<BR>
<BR>Safe surfing!
