When you think about the Internet and safety issues, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Probably it would be concerns about who your child is communicating with online or that your child is being exposed to inappropriate material. The Internet can be a wonderful resource for people to find products and services, conduct research, and chat with individuals from all over the world. While the Internet can open up a new world full of knowledge, it can also be a source of danger for users.. According to a study conducted by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, one out of every five children has been sexually solicited online. <B>MOST OF THESE CHILDREN DIDN'T TELL THEIR PARENTS. </B>For this reason, parents need to educate themselves about how the Internet works and where their children are going online. Children can be using online services at school, in a public library, or at a friend's home. So what's a parent to do? <B>Safety Tips for Parents</B> 
<UL>
<LI>The first thing is to talk to your child about your concerns. Encourage them to tell you about what they are viewing online. If someone or something makes them feel comfortable, let them know that they can talk to you, a teacher, or another trusted adult. 
<LI>Even experienced Internet users can find themselves on Web sites containing explicit, adult material. For example, one day I wanted to find the online souvenir store for a professional sports team. Instead of doing a search on Google or one of the other search engines, I typed the name of the store with "dot.com" after it. I was immediately taken to a pornographic Web site. So...time to use the "Back" button and do a Google search instead. Teach your child to use the "Back" or "Home" buttons to get out of a Web site that contains offensive material. 
<LI>You might want to direct your child to use a search engine for children, such as Yahooligans or bookmark some appropriate sites for your child to use. 
<LI>Location, location, location. Put the computer in the living room or family room, not in your child's bedroom. It's easier to keep track of their online experiences if the computer is in plain view. 
<LI>Install Filtering Software on your Computer. There are several filtering software programs on the market. These programs will block certain words from being searched. Some programs will restrict access to certain sites; others will allow parents to monitor e-mail messages, online chats, and postings to bulletin boards. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have software to block offensive material. These programs are useful tools, but they are no substitute for parental supervision. 
<LI>Put it in writing. You might want to draw up a contract with your child with respect to Internet use. Here is some sample wording: Contract for Internet Use for Parents 1. I will educate myself about how to use the Internet to help my child use online resources in a responsible manner. 2. I will provide my child with a list of age-appropriate Web sites he/she can access. 3. I will allow my child to have access to the Internet between the hours of ________ and _______ only, and only when I am home to supervise online use. 4. I will encourage my child to come to me with any questions or concerns he/she may have about what he/she is viewing online. 5. If my child comes to me with concerns about a Web site or has been sexually solicited, we will work together to find a solution to the problem. I understand that these situations are not my child's fault. Date: __________________________ Signature ____________________________&gt;br&gt;

Some Internet predators will gradually sway an online conversation to include sexual comments; others will take a bolder approach and immediately make inappropriate comments. Still others will use chat rooms to find children for face-to-face meetings and actual sexual contact. These computer-age sex offenders can be any age and of either gender - they do not fit the stereotype of the middle-aged man in the rumpled trench coat. <B>Signs Your Child May be at Risk</B> Here are some things to watch out for: Your child is spending a lot of time online. Children are most at risk at night and in chat rooms. Parents need to be aware of where their children are going online. You find pornography on a computer being used by your child. Parents need to be aware that children may save offensive images on computer discs or CDs. This is especially true if the computer is being used by other members of the family. Your child is receiving phone calls from people you don't know, making long distance calls to unfamiliar numbers, or receiving mail or gifts from unknown persons. Some predators will have an 800 number or instruct children to call them collect and then use Caller ID to find out your child's number. Your child changes the screen or shuts off the computer monitor when a parent enters the room. This may be a sign your child is viewing pornography. <B>What to Do if Your Child is Sexually Solicited or Receives Pornography</B> Turn off the computer to preserve evidence and immediately report the incident to your local law enforcement agency, the FBI, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Parents, you now have better idea of how online sexual predators attempt to engage children in inappropriate conversations, what signs might indicate your child is at risk, and some suggestions to keep your children safe while online. Our next lesson will provide safety information specifically for children and teens.
