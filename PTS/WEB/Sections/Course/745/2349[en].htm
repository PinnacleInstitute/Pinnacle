<B>Definitions</B>
<BR>
<BR>First, let's find out what these means of online communication are.
<BR>
<BR><B>E-mail</B> is a method of sending messages via computer. Just like regular mail, the messages are stored in a mail box until someone goes to retrieve them. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Instant messaging</B> software allows two people to communicate with each other in real time. Users will see a pop-up on their computer screen informing them they have a message. Teens spend a lot of time communicating with online buddies in this fashion. These communications are private. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Bulletin Boards</B> allow users to post messages in an open forum. They are not private. You may have to register to post messages, but any visitor to the Web site can read the messages posted there. Bulletin boards will have a moderator, who screens the messages for inappropriate content. Violators of the rules regarding content can be barred from posting any further message. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Chat Rooms</B> are similar to online bulletin boards, but they allow people to have conversations in real time. Chat rooms are not private; messages posted there can be read by anyone in the chat room at the time. Some chat rooms have private rooms; some of them also have moderators. 
<BR>
<BR><B>How to Choose a Screen Name</B>
<BR>
<BR>When choosing a screen name (your online identity, if you will), here are some things to keep in mind: 
<BR>
<BR>Choose a name that is gender-neutral. 
<BR>
<BR>Choose something that is non-offensive - no suggestive or coarse language. 
<BR>
<BR>You can make reference to an interest or a hobby as long as it doesn't serve to identify your real name or location. For example, you could choose metsfan, luvmydog, or bookworm. You can also use a combination of words and numbers: star043, skywalker1953, or watcher1212. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Safety Tips</B>
<BR>
<BR>The easiest and best way to stay safe while communicating online is to be a good online citizen. Don't send messages when you're tired or angry, and think about what you are saying before you press "Send". With written communications, you don't have extra information provided by the tone of someone's voice or body language. Keep it simple. 
<BR>
<BR>DON'T SEND A MESSAGE ALL IN CAPS! It looks like you are yelling at someone. 
<BR>
<BR>Keep in mind that e-mail is not private; messages can be forwarded to anyone. Don't put anything in writing you wouldn't want made public. 
<BR>
<BR>Don't open e-mail attachments from anyone you don't know. 
<BR>
<BR>Report unsolicited e-mail (spam) to your Internet Service Provider. You can also ask the sender to remove you from their mailing list. 
<BR>
<BR>Children should be taught to tell a parent if anything contained in any form of an online message makes them uncomfortable. Block the offending party's e-mail address, if necessary. 
<BR>
<BR>Keep in mind that people in chat rooms may not be who they appear to be. Some online predators pretend to be children or teens to make contact with children. 
<BR>
<BR>If you read a disturbing message in a chat room, you may want to go into a private room with the chat room monitor and request that the sender be banned from the chat room. Otherwise, don't go into private chat rooms. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Cyberbullying</B>
<BR>
<BR>Cyberbullying is schoolyard bullying in the computer age. The perpetrators use chat rooms, instant messaging, e-mail, and Web sites to harass and embarrass the victim. Cellular phones with instant messaging and picture features are being used to forward embarrassing photos and messages all over cyberspace. 
<BR>
<BR>With cyberbullying, the bullies have the potential to remain anonymous, while the end result is always hurtful to the recipient. Because the behavior doesn't take place in a specific geographical location, the victim can't get away from it. Home is not a safe haven if the harassment is being done by computer. Bullies don't appreciate the consequences of their actions because they don't see the victim being upset or crying. As a result, they are more likely to be cruel. 
<BR>
<BR>Both girls and boys can be victims of cyberbullying. Boys are usually bullied about their sexual orientation; girls are harassed about their appearance. 
<BR>
<BR>Here are some examples: 
<BR>
<BR>A Japanese boy was photographed without his knowledge while he was changing in his school's locker room after gym class. The photos were distributed sent to classmates' cell phones before he returned to class, In another case, a girl's face was cropped and pasted onto a pornographic Web site. In still another instance, after a 16-year-old broke up with her boyfriend, she found that he had sent her e-mail, street address, and cell phone number to several adult-oriented Web sites. She had people instant messaging her and contacting her home. 
<BR>
<BR>Because Internet use is so widespread among young people, the potential for this type of behavior is likely to increase. This type of bullying is very difficult for parents to monitor. Schools are starting to make students and their parents aware of the problem and that it will not be tolerated. 
<BR>
<BR>What can you do if you are being bullied in this manner? The first thing is not to respond. Like all bullies, cyberbullies are looking to trigger a response. Part of the point is to make you feel isolated, so be sure to tell a trusted adult. 
<BR>
<BR>Do not delete the offensive messages from either the computer or the cell phone. Save them as evidence. Contact your Internet Service Provider, cellular phone service provider, and the police. 
<BR>
<BR>You might have to get a new e-mail account or cell phone number. Be selective who you give your new phone number and/or e-mail address to. Instant Messaging software usually has a means of blocking or banning messages from certain senders. 
<BR>
<BR>Ultimately, the best way to stop this type of bullying is for parents to learn about the technology their children are using and that it has the potential to be abused in this fashion. Children also need to know that if it happens to them, it's not their fault and that they can get help to deal with it.
