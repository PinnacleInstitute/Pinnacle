Pesky behavior problems are those annoying "little" behavior problems that are usually a low-level source of stress in a family or group of children. &nbsp;They are not serious, dangerous or even overly noticeable. &nbsp;Sometimes you feel like they are not even important enough to act upon, but at other times, they can drive you absolutely crazy. &nbsp;These annoyances do, however, contribute greatly to the stress levels in your home, group or classroom. &nbsp;Taken singly, they seem insignificant, but the constant, irritating nature of these problems makes them well worth your time and effort to solve. 
<BR>
<BR>The behaviors in this group include such things as whining, tattling, lying, bickering, talking back and so forth. &nbsp;Most adults will agree that these behaviors are undesirable and most adults will also concur that they can be extremely tricky to change. &nbsp;What makes them so difficult to deal with? &nbsp;There are several things. 
<BR>
<BR>We spoke in earlier lessons about the need to describe behavior in observable, measurable terms. &nbsp;It's important that everyone who works with the child agrees about what is happening and how often it is happening. It's easy to see if a child is hitting or taking toys from another. &nbsp;These actions are easily quantifiable, and there will be little doubt about whether the behavior did or did not occur. However, most of the pesky behavior problems are more subjective in nature. &nbsp;Adults generally feel that whining is unacceptable, but it can be tough to agree on when it actually happens. &nbsp;What sounds like unacceptable whining to one care-giver may be ignored by another. 
<BR>
<BR>In addition, our own level of tolerance for these behaviors tends to vary. &nbsp;When we are feeling good, and things are going well, whining or bickering may not seem to be a big deal. &nbsp;Tattling can be laughed off rather than viewed as a nuisance. &nbsp;When we ourselves are tired or stressed, however, suddenly these behaviors are very annoying and we respond quite differently. &nbsp;Children can become very confused when their teachers, parents or care providers respond inconsistently to their behaviors. &nbsp;They cannot predict the outcome of their actions. From their perspective, sometimes the whining is ignored, sometimes it is treated as a behavior problem, and sometimes it works. &nbsp;This inconsistent response leads to constant testing of limits and generally will cause an increase in the problem behavior. 
<BR>
<BR>Many of these pesky problems also have degrees of severity. &nbsp;We all tolerate at least small amounts of the behaviors without even thinking about it. &nbsp;Some adults may tolerate bickering during free play, for example, but not during more structured times. &nbsp;Some may respond to whiny tones when they know the child is uncomfortable or ill, but not first thing in the morning. &nbsp;When we overlook pesky problems, they can build to a crescendo until we finally need to respond. 
<BR>
<BR>Finally, most of these behaviors work well for children, at least in some settings. &nbsp;Many adults are more likely to give in to a whinychild's request, just to end the whining. &nbsp;Bickering children are placated to put a halt to the annoying arguments. &nbsp;Tattlers see the adult take action on the situation they want changed. &nbsp;When pesky behaviors become successful strategies, they are very difficult to change. &nbsp;They turn into habits, and we all know how difficult it can be to break a habit, even long after it has lost its original purpose. 
<BR>
<BR>Difficult as they may be to change, it is well worth your time and effort to help your child control these problems. &nbsp;After all, no one enjoys being around an adult who bickers, whines or tattles. &nbsp;Control of these behaviors begins in childhood, and it's up to you to help your children learn those skills. &nbsp;These behaviors also add to your stress as a care-giver. &nbsp;If they become too commonplace, you will begin to feel that every day is a "bad" day. 
<BR>
<BR>Apply the same basic principles of behavior management to pesky problems. &nbsp;First, put your finger on the real problem. &nbsp;Pesky problems can be a constant source of stress, and people under stress sometimes respond with disproportionate reactions after letting annoyances build up over time. &nbsp;Sometimes we even have difficulty knowing what is actually bothering us, and react strongly to situations that have nothing to do with the real problem. &nbsp;If you can name the real problem, you have taken the first step to solving it. 
<BR>
<BR>Secondly, look for the underlying cause of the behavior. &nbsp;Look for patterns in the time of day, the activity, the stimulation level, the interactions with others and so forth. &nbsp;Does the problem occur at any particular time or in any special circumstance? &nbsp;What does the child gain from the behavior - attention? &nbsp;Delay of an undesirable activity? Prolonging a desirable activity? &nbsp;Once you find a cause, &nbsp;you are on your way to finding a cure. 
<BR>
<BR>Finally, make a plan. &nbsp;How can you address the situation in a more positive way? &nbsp;What can you teach the child to do differently? Perhaps you can change the behavior with redirection, reminders, distraction, or offering a different solution before the problem starts. &nbsp;Maybe you can change the outcome of the behavior by ignoring it, ensuring a negative consequence, or keeping the child from achieving his or her goal? &nbsp;Can you teach a different, more acceptable behavior than can be substituted for the problem behavior? 
<BR>
<BR>Each of these steps is important in eliminating pesky behavior problems. &nbsp;Be sure to keep records of what you try and how well it works. &nbsp;You'll also want to count the number of occurrences before you start and after you've been trying your intervention for a while to see if your plan is effective. 
<BR>
<BR>Now that we've reviewed the basics, let's look at each of the pesky behavior problems separately. &nbsp;Though I've got them grouped together for the purposes of this lesson, there are different management ideas that you may find effective for different situations that I'd like to share with you. 
<BR>
<BR>Lying can be a pesky problem for some children. &nbsp;It's tough to realize that your innocent, sweet little child is intentionally telling untruths for whatever reason. &nbsp;Being human, some of the built-in trust is shattered in the relationship. &nbsp;We worry that children's small lies will inevitably lead to a lifetime of untrustworthiness. &nbsp;Perhaps the easiest way to tackle this pesky problem is to consider the age and developmental stages that underlie children's falsehoods. 
<BR>
<BR>Very young children may not have a clear idea of what is real and what is not. &nbsp;They easily confuse the imaginary with reality, the wished for with the actuality, and the made-up story with the real thing. The most troublesome type of lying from very young children often happens when the child is caught in the act or with evidence of a "crime." &nbsp;For example, a child sitting in the middle of a mess will probably say "no" when asked if s/he made the mess. &nbsp;These are often considered to be the child's first lie, and the adults have trouble understanding why in the world they even bother! &nbsp;After all, the evidence is clear, and lying just makes it worse. &nbsp;However, we need to remember that young children's minds do not work in the same ways that ours do. &nbsp;They very much want to please the adults in their lives, and this particular adult is stern and maybe even angry. &nbsp;The youngster understands enough about social cues to know the answer that should make the sternness go away – “Of course I didn’t make this mess if it's going to make you this upset! &nbsp;That must be what you want to hear.” &nbsp;In short, we have set the child up to tell a lie without even thinking, just by the way we asked the question. &nbsp;Now we must deal with two problems: the original misbehavior and the untruth. 
<BR>
<BR>A better way to handle the situation is to avoid that troublesome first question. &nbsp;There's really no need to ask it anyway, is there? Instead, you can confront your child with the evidence: "Here's a big mess and here you are in the middle of it! &nbsp;What do you need to do now?" &nbsp;Hopefully, your child will respond with some version of "clean it up." &nbsp;You can talk together about whatever rule has been violated and avoid setting the stage for a lie in the first place. 
<BR>
<BR>As children grow, the possible reasons for lies expand and change. Kids may lie to escape punishment, to boost their own self-esteem, or because they honestly are mistaken. &nbsp;Older kids may lie to maintain privacy or to attempt to gain independence. &nbsp;These lies all have different roots, and you'll need to take a close look at the causes to determine how to best respond. &nbsp;Our own examples also have a profound impact on how children view the telling of untruths. &nbsp;Do we fib about tax information, tell untruths to our spouses, or varnish the truth in any other situation? &nbsp;What about so-called "white lies"? &nbsp;Too much honesty can be a difficult matter, as anyone with a brutally honest three-year-old knows when they loudly comment about the fat lady in front of you in line. &nbsp;You can discuss alternatives to white lies: avoiding the discussion, finding a detail to compliment instead of a general rave, keeping our opinions to ourselves if they could be hurtful and so forth. 
<BR>
<BR>If your child has slipped into habitual lying for whatever reason, there are several strategies that you can try. &nbsp;One thing to avoid, however, is labeling your child a liar. &nbsp;Labels like that are self-fulfilling and can make your child feel that change is impossible. &nbsp;Be sure that you are scrupulously honest in all you do, because children are quick to follow your example. &nbsp;Take opportunities to discuss the benefits of being trusted. &nbsp;Be sure to notice when kids tell the truth and praise their efforts. &nbsp;Set up a consequence for lying, such as diminished freedom or limitations on borrowing items. &nbsp;Be sure there is a concrete way for the child to earn his or her way back into trustworthy status. 
<BR>
<BR>Finally, remember that lying can be a sign of serious mental problems as well. &nbsp;If you continue to see difficulties in this area after working with these and similar suggestions, your child may need assistance from a mental health professional. 
<BR>
<BR>Backtalk is another of the pesky problems that can make adults' lives miserable. &nbsp;It's a common response from unhappy children that can be very aggravating. &nbsp;Backtalk is born from a desire to have the last word. &nbsp;The snappy comeback makes many children, powerless people that they are, feel more in control of the situation. &nbsp;The most effective strategy for change will be to meet the underlying need for control and also to make sure that backtalk has undesirable consequences. 
<BR>
<BR>Look at your routines with this child and find places where he or she could take on more responsibility and control in life. &nbsp;After all, the ultimate goal of teaching or parenting is to raise an independent child. &nbsp;You can also put the choice of misbehavior onto the child.&nbsp; Set up the consequence that you feel is appropriate and make your warnings something like this: "If you choose to ____, then you will cause this (consequence) for yourself. &nbsp;It's up to you." 
<BR>
<BR>Check out your response to backtalk as well. &nbsp;If you are responding angrily, your child has discovered a way to get a free show. &nbsp;Also, many children discover that if they can shift adult attention to the backtalk issue, the original behavior problem is swept under the rug and goes without consequence. &nbsp;For example, say your child has neglected to put away toys. &nbsp;When you correct the problem, the child responds with backtalk. &nbsp;Feeling that it is quite rude, you implement a consequence for the smart mouth. &nbsp;The toys, however, are still on the floor and the child has successfully diverted your attention. 
<BR>
<BR>You can ignore backtalk. &nbsp;In this way, it will not shift your focus or allow the child extra attention. &nbsp;But it is rude and disrespectful, and many adults feel it should not be tolerated. &nbsp;If that is the case for you, then be very clear about exactly what constitutes backtalk.&nbsp; Is it the tone, the words, the intention? &nbsp;Remember to apply the test of objectivity: If I walked into your house, would I recognize what you are looking for? &nbsp;Then stick to your guns, be consistent and apply your stated consequence. &nbsp;Find ways to meet the underlying need and you can minimize the behavior. &nbsp;Disrupt its rewards and implement a negative consequence, and you'll be able to rid your home or classroom of this pesky problem. 
<BR>
<BR>Tattling is another pesky problem that can annoy adults. &nbsp;We'll assume there are times that you really want children to come to you and tell you what's going on, like if someone is injured or similar emergency. The problem comes in when you are asked to intervene in minor disagreements, to solve inadvertent or accidental problems, or resolve differences of opinion. &nbsp;What we really need to do is teach the kids discernment about which situations need your attention and which should be ignored or solved on their own. 
<BR>
<BR>Start by teaching when it is and is not acceptable to tell. &nbsp;Give them clear guidelines, such as "Let me know if someone is in danger." &nbsp;It's also possible to head tattlers off at the pass, so to speak. &nbsp;Children who intend to tattle give clues through facial expressions, body language or tone when they approach adults. &nbsp;You can ask a series of questions, like "Is someone going to be hurt? &nbsp;Do I need to hear about this?" 
<BR>
<BR>Tattlers may have underlying needs as well that you can meet in other ways. &nbsp;A child who tattles to gain your attention may respond well if you can find other ways to give that positive attention and ignore the tattling behavior. &nbsp;If you notice a child tattling to gain possession of a toy, make sure the disputed toy is removed when tattling occurs. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>Bickering is one of those little annoyances that seems to go on no matter what we try. &nbsp;Kids may fight about nearly anything, from the television to the game chosen to who sits where. &nbsp;The behavior does absolutely nothing to solve the original problem and often compounds it with hard feelings. &nbsp;Whether your children bicker in the car, at home, in the classroom or at daycare, there are some solutions that you can use to help them learn to get along better and save your sanity along the way. 
<BR>
<BR>Like the other pesky problems, bickering can have underlying causes that can be addressed to help you minimize it. &nbsp;Sometimes bickering is caused by internal discomforts. &nbsp;A child who is tired, hungry, ill, cold or hot is quite likely to be quarrelsome. &nbsp;Small annoyances take on gigantic proportions. &nbsp;The solution is to help the child recognize the true difficulty and take steps to fix it. &nbsp;Adults may need to help with the process: "It seems like you're feeling bad inside today. &nbsp;I know you didn't sleep well last night, and I bet you're feeling tired. &nbsp;It's hard to be cheerful when you're tired."&nbsp; Bickering can also be a sign of internal turmoil. &nbsp;If a child is under undue stress, he or she may lash out at others in this way. &nbsp;Again, it's important to help the child name what's really going on inside emotionally. 
<BR>
<BR>At times, kids will bicker when they honestly feel their rights have been violated. &nbsp;Bickering can be a misguided attempt to stand up for themselves. &nbsp;You can make bickering into an unproductive strategy by removing the item that is the focus (from everyone!), by turning off the television and so forth. &nbsp;You can also introduce consequences for bickering if you wish, but it is such a low-level annoyance that it can be difficult to pin down and therefore difficult to follow through with a consistent response. 
<BR>
<BR>Perhaps the best strategy is to teach the kids better conflict resolution skills. &nbsp;A simple method that will work for even young children is to identify the true problem and then tell how the situation makes them feel. &nbsp;Next, have each brainstorm possible solutions. &nbsp;Any solution can be added to the list - no judging about good or bad, right or wrong! Now, choose the solution that seems best to everyone. &nbsp;Adults in charge can guide, teach and model. 
<BR>
<BR>Whining, the last of the pesky problems that we'll deal with in class, is one of the most annoying habits that children can pick up. &nbsp;That awful, grating tone of voice shreds adult nerves and makes us wonder why we want to be around children at all. &nbsp;Thankfully, there are solutions. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>Whining is a purposeful behavior. &nbsp;Kids whine to get what they want. Why do they use such an annoying tactic? &nbsp;Because it WORKS! &nbsp;All people tend to repeat successful behaviors that help them reach goals and children are no exception. &nbsp;Somewhere in the whiny child's life, this behavior has achieved goals. &nbsp;Perhaps at home, at the sitter's, or in daycare or school, whining has gotten results. 
<BR>
<BR>The problem can sneak up on any adult. &nbsp;Whining is one of those behaviors without a clear, objective definition. &nbsp;It can change very gradually from a minor and almost imperceptible annoyance to a major problem. &nbsp;People have different levels of tolerance for whining, and everyone's tolerance varies with their own moods. &nbsp;Children quickly 
<BR>learn that there are times and places when whining gets results. &nbsp;Well-meaning parents or care-givers may give in to a whining child who is tired, hungry or ill. &nbsp;Tired, busy or exasperated parents may comply with the whining child's demands to end the annoyance. &nbsp;Each time the child gets what is wanted by whining, the habit is strengthened. 
<BR>
<BR>The solution is to make sure that whining becomes an unsuccessful strategy. &nbsp;Like most habits, it will take time and persistence to change. &nbsp;Awareness is the first step. &nbsp;Pay attention to when and where the whining occurs. &nbsp;What situations and circumstances trigger the behavior? &nbsp;When you receive a request in a whiny tone, do not accommodate the child. &nbsp;You have several options for alternative responses. &nbsp;The most severe response would be to refuse the whiny request altogether. &nbsp;Be sure to tell the child why the request was denied, and be clear about when he or she can ask again. &nbsp;This solution will be most effective in the shortest amount of time. &nbsp;For circumstances where this method is not an option, or for dealing with a less serious whining problem, you can ask the child to rephrase the whiny request. &nbsp;Some adults have had success with refusing to hear whining: They do not even acknowledge that they heard anything at all. &nbsp;Most children quickly rethink the value of the technique once it no longer has the desired results. &nbsp;If the whining child has the skills, he or she can be told to put the requests into writing. &nbsp;It's hard to whine using pencil and paper! 
<BR>
<BR>You can see a pattern among all of these pesky problems. &nbsp;The best solutions are combined methods. &nbsp;Try to find alternative ways to meet the child's needs and also provide a negative consequence or interrupt the behavior's success. &nbsp;This basic method will work on nearly any pesky problem and put you back in charge of how you respond to behaviors.
