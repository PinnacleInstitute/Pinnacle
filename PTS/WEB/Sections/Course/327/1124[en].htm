Well, you've done it!&nbsp; You've finished all seven lessons of the Behavior Management Toolkit.&nbsp; Hopefully, you've gathered up some new ideas and new ways of looking at behavior, and you've found some new strategies to make your home, daycare, or classroom a more peaceful and productive place.&nbsp; 
<P>This final exam will help us both to see what you've learned and gained from class.&nbsp; Feel free to review lessons before you tackle it if you wish.&nbsp; I can't wait to see how much you've learned!
