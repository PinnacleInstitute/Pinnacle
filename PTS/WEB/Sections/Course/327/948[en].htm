Why do parents, teachers, group leaders, and daycare providers need to control children's behavior? &nbsp;To keep the group safe; to maintain order; to ensure that everyone's rights are respected; to create a calm environment; to allow planned activities to be accomplished efficiently; and to maintain sanity of the adults! &nbsp;These aims can be accomplished in two basic ways: &nbsp;Either we teach the children what not to do and enforce that with punishment for crimes, or we teach the children what to do and reward the behaviors that we wish to see continued. &nbsp;Of course, there is no black and white on this issue, and a mix of both sides of the coin is often needed. &nbsp;However, because of the way we were raised, or because of our habits, or because of our mood, or because of what seems to work quickly and easily, many of us focus far too frequently on the negative methods: scolding, reprimanding, punishing, removing privileges, isolation, and so forth. &nbsp;The necessary balance is disrupted. 
<BR>
<BR>The goal of behavior management is to help each child learn to govern his or her own behavior. &nbsp;EVERYONE learns best under positive circumstances. &nbsp;Consider for a moment how you prefer to learn new things. &nbsp;Is it more pleasant to learn with encouragement and rewards for a job well done? &nbsp;Do you feel better about your task when given positive feedback, or do you prefer punishment when mistakes are made? &nbsp;The answer is quite obvious, and children feel just the same way that you do. &nbsp;Positive management techniques are more effective than negative for this reason. 
<BR>
<BR>Positive is less stressful than negative. &nbsp;Research shows that too much anger, frustration, or other negative feelings can have an adverse effect on physical well-being. &nbsp;Our bodies are hard-wired to avoid those things that make us feel this way. &nbsp;It takes far fewer muscles to smile than to frown. &nbsp;When we are under stress, physiological changes include increased blood pressure, slowed digestion, rapid heartbeat, and so forth. &nbsp;All of these put pressure on our &nbsp;physiological well-being. &nbsp;Negative responses to behaviors can cause all of these occurrences, not only in our own bodies, but also in the children around us. 
<BR>
<BR>Even children who are not involved in the negative interaction can feel threatened and upset by it. &nbsp;Adult anger, especially when the cause is unclear to the child, is VERY scary! &nbsp;This is the exact opposite of the nurturing and loving environment that we wish to create for kids. &nbsp;Positive management techniques create a less stressful environment for adults and children. 
<BR>
<BR>Your attention is a powerful reward. &nbsp;Even negative attention is better to many children than no attention from you at all. &nbsp;Children see very clearly what actions others are taking that claim your attention, and many will devise something similar to get the same for themselves. &nbsp;This is why misbehavior sometimes seems to be contagious, and the control of the entire group can vanish for periods of time. Positive management techniques focus on giving appropriate attention for praise-worthy behavior. 
<BR>
<BR>It is also far less stressful on you as care provider or group leader to use positive management techniques. Consider how you feel at the end of different types of days….the days that "went well" leave you feeling upbeat, happy, and ready for action tomorrow. &nbsp;The days that were full of dealing with behavior problems in a negative way make you wonder why you want to be around children, anyway. &nbsp;You feel tired, depressed, and burned out. It's hard to give the kids your best when you feel this way, and it can be a tough cycle to break out of. &nbsp;It 
<BR>can raise the stress level in your life, not just while you're with the kids, but at other times, too. &nbsp;And when you are stressed out, you are far more likely to use more negative responses again. &nbsp;The cycle rolls onward. 
<P>
<BR>So, your methods of handling improper behavior not only have an immediate effect on the child that you are trying to correct, but also on his or her long-term behavior, the actions and emotions of the other children in the area, and even on your own physical and emotional well-being. &nbsp;Consider keeping a log for the next week or two - how are you usually dealing with behavior problems? &nbsp;Are these methods effective (does the behavior decrease)? What is the tone of the room immediately after you have corrected a child? &nbsp;Can you zero in on the child who is having the problem, or are you reprimanding the entire group for the actions of one or a few? &nbsp;How do you feel at the end of the day? &nbsp;What is your personal stress level? &nbsp;Check yourself to see how positive and negative methods are being balanced. &nbsp;The positive should not only balance the negative, but should outweigh it by five to ten times. &nbsp;This means that you should be using positive management techniques five or ten times as often as you use negative ones. 
<BR>
<BR>There are a number of techniques that you can use to increase the amount of positive interactions that you and the child or children are involved in. &nbsp;Building self-esteem, praising appropriate behavior, giving extra attention, and assigning responsibility are four places to begin. &nbsp;These four areas provide parents, care givers and teachers with a wealth of opportunities to send positive signals to individuals and groups. &nbsp;Realistically speaking, these actions will not eliminate disruptive or negative behaviors. &nbsp;There is no magical cure that works for every situation.&nbsp;However, if you can intentionally implement some of these suggestions, you will head off unwelcome behaviors that happen because a child wants extra attention, because a child feels unaccepted, or because a child is having a difficult time in another area of life. &nbsp;You are also likely to influence the behavior of the child who is considering acting out, the follower who may imitate someone else's misbehavior, or the child who is struggling with a bad reputation or prejudices based on previous behavior in other settings at other times. 
<BR>
<BR>Build self-esteem! &nbsp;Every human being has a built-in need to be welcomed, wanted and successful. &nbsp;Everyone wants to be accepted and loved. &nbsp;When people feel unloved, unvalued or unlovable, they often resort to unacceptable behaviors to provide the missing pieces. &nbsp;These strategies are usually ineffective in the long run, and the person who uses them consistently will add them to a long and growing list of "things I can't seem to do right." &nbsp;Seeing everyone else succeeding around them adds to the burden, and a vicious circle begins that can be very difficult to break out of without help. 
<BR>
<BR>The key to the prison is self-esteem. &nbsp;When a person feels valuable, worthwhile, important, special and loved, many behaviors that are unacceptable will slowly disappear because these needs are being met in more positive and effective ways. &nbsp;Our job as adult care-givers is to find ways to boost each child (whether they have a behavior problem or not!) and help him or her develop self-confidence, self-worth and a knowledge of their own value. &nbsp;This is not a one-time activity that you can drag out every year or two, but an ongoing project that needs attention every single day. &nbsp;A worthy (and realistic) goal is to find some way to show each child in your care how important he or she is each and every day. &nbsp;In addition to that, help children discover their individuality, nurture their unique talents, and guide them towards appreciating all the individuals around them. &nbsp;Don't allow others to tear people down in your presence. &nbsp;Put a quick end to hurtful comments, squelch mean teasing, encourage the use of good manners at all times, and teach AND MODEL respect for all (children and adults alike). 
<BR>
<BR>Try these suggestions to build self-esteem: 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Complimentary Alliterations: &nbsp;Think of a nice word to say about someone that begins with the same letter as his or her name. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Role play good manners and practice giving compliments. &nbsp;Often, we don't say and do what we should, and practice helps! 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Make a "ME" collage: Use old magazines to cut out favorite items, such as foods, toys, colors, pets and so forth. &nbsp;Paste them onto a paper and title it "ME!" 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Hold a talent show! &nbsp;It doesn't have to be well-planned or elaborate, though you can make it as formal as you wish. &nbsp;Just having the opportunity to get up in front of a group and show a trick, a special reading, a picture or other talent will help some kids shine. 
<BR>
<BR>Praising appropriate behavior is another way to build positive responses into your day with kids. &nbsp;Catch 'em being good! &nbsp;Be very liberal with your compliments to children who are behaving appropriately. &nbsp;It's very easy to get caught up in watching for the inappropriate and negative behaviors, and that can take up all of your time if you are not careful. &nbsp;The misbehaviors command your attention more easily because they demand a response from you. &nbsp;Think about which you are more likely to address: the child who just poked someone, or the kid who followed your directions? &nbsp;Because the negative is so easy to see, we need to be all the more intentional about commenting on the positive. &nbsp;You may even try keeping score (or having someone else keep score for you). &nbsp;How many comments out of your mouth are positive, praising or complimentary, and how many are negative, correcting or reprimanding? &nbsp;It's an interesting and enlightening experiment to try. &nbsp;No one around to help you out? &nbsp;Try a tape recorder! &nbsp;And it doesn't matter whether the negative was "justified" or not - just look at the totals. &nbsp;If you are not pleased with what you see, try these substitutes: 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;When even one child is behaving appropriately, give him or her a reward or compliment. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Try thanking kids for following the rules or directions. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Whisper to children who are listening, like you have an exciting secret. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Set a goal of complimenting each child a specific number of times during the day; REAL compliments now, not empty ones! 
<BR>
<BR>As noted before, your attention is probably the single most powerful tool that you have for changing behavior. Even negative attention is better than no attention at all for many children, which explains why scolding, reprimanding, lecturing, and so forth are seldom effective behavior management techniques. &nbsp;The child has your undivided attention, even if it is negative, and many are seeking just that. &nbsp;In our fast-paced world, many children are being "swept under the rug," so to speak, and no one is paying attention to them unless they do 
<BR>something that is out of line. &nbsp;They quickly learn that misbehavior is what is needed to get a dose of adult attention. &nbsp;This is a tough cycle to break, but it is possible! &nbsp;Here are some ways to provide attention in a positive way. &nbsp;They work with different age groups in different settings, so pick and choose the techniques that best match your circumstances and meet your personal needs. 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Have lunch with a child. &nbsp;Sit near them at meal or snack time, or better yet, invite a child to eat in a private place with you. Have a luncheon appointment! 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Hold a private story time. &nbsp;Invite the honoree to join you at the beginning of nap time for a special short story or poem shared with just the two of you. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be long, just personal. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Join in a game. Play a board game, do a puzzle, take some time to focus on one child and lavish attention on him or her. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Use your attention as a reward for a job well-done. &nbsp;Set up a system in which positive behavior traits and actions can earn your attention. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Spend just a little time with each child every day that is theirs and theirs alone. &nbsp;Have a short conversation with just that child. &nbsp;Take a minute to ask about something special, or talk about the day. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Send a card or a note through the mail. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be much; a simple postcard or note will do just fine. Kids love to get mail. 
<BR>
<BR>You can also be positive with your children by encouraging feelings of responsibility. &nbsp;Children everywhere strive for independence from infancy onward. &nbsp;Toddlers communicate this by saying "I can do it MYSELF!" &nbsp;Older children proudly show you the results of their efforts. &nbsp;You can use this natural process to nurture positive interactions. Praise children for showing positive character traits such as honesty, responsibility and compassion. &nbsp;Expect the children to clean up their own messes, help clean and wash tables when needed, treat supplies and equipment properly, and so forth. &nbsp;Most of all, encourage individuals to be responsible for their own actions. &nbsp;Do not accept excuses that attempt to blame others: "I didn't hit Tommy; he just jumped in front of my hand"; "I wasn't the last one to play with it so I don't need to put it away"; "I took that away from her because she wasn't supposed to have it." 
<BR>
<BR>You can avoid many potential behavior problems by structuring your activities carefully, rearranging people and objects, and planning for difficult times such as transitions and getting the kids' attention. If you analyze your day, you may see times and activities that are prone to disruptive or inappropriate behavior. &nbsp;Discover these trends by keeping a diary for a few days. &nbsp;What parts of your day are working well and which are not? &nbsp;What time of day did you notice that you started feeling more negative than positive? &nbsp;What were the kids supposed to be doing when they seemed to forget every rule in the book? &nbsp;Who was interacting with whom when the two kids started bickering? &nbsp;After a few days of noticing these details, a pattern may emerge. &nbsp;Perhaps only one or two children are having trouble getting along, or the whole group loses control immediately before lunchtime. &nbsp;Maybe you're having trouble regaining their attention after gross motor activities. &nbsp;Whatever the case may be, once you see the pattern, you can begin to take steps towards a cure. 
<BR>
<BR>Transitions are often the<FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3> source of behavior difficulties.&nbsp; Some children feel&nbsp;very frustrated when they feel they do not have time to finish a project. </FONT>&nbsp;Others simply want to continue an activity until THEY decide they are done. &nbsp;A child may get distracted by the change and not hear and follow the directions for the next activity. &nbsp;Some have trouble cleaning up; others use the opportunity to disrupt the group. &nbsp;Head off potential behavior problems by planning your transition times. &nbsp;Here are a few tips: 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;First, give a warning or signal that this activity is nearing its end. &nbsp;You may want to give a "five minutes left" signal, make an announcement, remind children to "do their last thing," or ask them to finish in the next five minutes. &nbsp;Whatever method you choose, give the children warning that a change is coming up and an opportunity to complete whatever they happen to be working on. 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;With a group, use a signal to get attention. &nbsp;You may choose different signals for different circumstances: What works to end a quiet reading time may not be adequate to gather the group from a playground. &nbsp;A whistle, a bell, a flick of the lights, a few notes on a musical instrument, a special song, a "repeat after me" activity, and even a visual signal such as a flag are all ideas to try. &nbsp;It can be more effective to use a whispering voice than to shout, because more and more people will gather to hear what is being said "in secret." 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Have a plan for cleaning up and putting away supplies. &nbsp;Give out jobs, choose helpers, make each child responsible for his or her own mess, or whatever you wish, but have a plan. &nbsp;This will help avoid 
<BR>children acting out because they don't have anything better to do. Who is responsible for putting what things away, for cleaning the floor, for gathering up supplies? 
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Use the transition time to shift the mood of the children, if you wish. &nbsp;If you are changing from a quiet activity to an active one, sing a rousing song or do some exercise. &nbsp;If you are trying to tone things down, try a quiet song, a quick story or a word game. 
<BR>
<BR>With these suggestions to get you started, you can set the stage for using more positive kinds of behavior management. &nbsp;Use these ideas and the ones that you come up with to tip the balance away from the negative methods that you'll need to use from time to time. &nbsp;Remember to try for five to ten positives for every negative, and you'll be well on your way to a less stressful, more positive way of dealing with children's behavior.
