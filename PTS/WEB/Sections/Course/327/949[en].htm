<BR>Time out - It's probably the most widely-used, all-purpose behavior management tool in the United States. &nbsp;The concept is that a misbehaving child is removed from the group and given time to cool down, to calm him or herself, or think about misdeeds and how to avoid them in the future. &nbsp;Various versions exist, including having children sit out from recess or other fun activities, sit on a "thinking chair" to contemplate proper behavior, or wait in a secluded area of the room until a specified amount of time has passed. &nbsp;There are probably even those among us who recall children being sat in a corner when they misbehaved, and parents have long used the consequence of "go to your room" with children of nearly any age. &nbsp;Time out is quite likely to be here to stay in our culture. &nbsp;It is generally easily implemented and not considered to be overly punitive by most. 
<BR>
<BR>Childcare professionals in the United States debate whether time out should be used at all with young children. Opponents see it as ineffective and sometimes detrimental. &nbsp;It can be overused, and considered more of a tool for adults' benefit than that of the children. Concern has been raised about whether time out accomplishes the goal of helping the child learn improved behavioral strategies and develop internal controls. &nbsp;It is important, if you are working professionally with children, to clarify your institution's stance on the use of time out or to develop a clear policy statement for your own childcare program. 
<BR>
<BR>Time out can be a very effective tool for behavior management, but it needs to be used wisely and monitored carefully. &nbsp;Many adults accidentally undermine time out's effectiveness in different ways, then conclude that the method doesn't work well for them. 
<BR>
<BR>Experts say that time out should be limited to no longer than one minute per year of the child's chronological age. &nbsp;If a preschooler is put into time out for 15 minutes, the feeling is that he or she will lose track of why time out was used in the first place. &nbsp;Many young children simply can't keep track of events for long periods of time. &nbsp;Long time outs can end up being confusing and actually detrimental to the child. 
<BR>
<BR>Time outs also should take place in a neutral setting. &nbsp;Putting a child in his or her room for time out can often backfire - think of all the toys and other enjoyable items in most children's bedrooms!&nbsp; Similarly, the child's time out area should not be in an area with high visibility. &nbsp;Others should not see the child and the child should not be able to watch the goings-on. &nbsp;Be especially careful to ensure that the time out area is not near the television! &nbsp;It's difficult for the child in time out to consider alternatives if the TV is in view.&nbsp; One alternative that has been successful for some families is to make the time out area wherever the parent, teacher or caregiver is at the moment. &nbsp;Other families have sent children to serve time out in someone else's room, rather than their own. 
<BR>
<BR>Be sure the time out area is free from hazards and temptations, too.&nbsp; I have a vivid memory of a boy who was constantly in trouble in my kindergarten class, years ago. &nbsp;The teacher, finally frustrated beyond her ability to cope, sent him to the 1960's version of time out. &nbsp;He was put into the classroom supply closet. &nbsp;Later, when his time was up, she discovered that he had eaten the entire box of cookies intended for the classroom snack and was busily playing with the clay he had found. &nbsp;That time out surely did backfire! &nbsp;As a general rule, time out areas should be easily monitored and safe for children. Confining children in any way, shape or form is not acceptable, and in many places, may be illegal. &nbsp;Be sure there is no access to items that can be damaged or vandalized. 
<BR>
<BR>Time out (and any other consequence for behavior) should be applied consistently. &nbsp;No consequence or reward will be effective if the adults are not consistent with its use. &nbsp;One of the most powerful reward systems is the random reward. &nbsp;If an action sometimes pays off and the person cannot predict when it will be worthwhile, that behavior will actually increase. &nbsp;This is exactly the situation that adults unwittingly create when they implement consequences part of the time. &nbsp;The child is never sure that punishment or adverse consequences will be applied, so the behavior is almost always "worth it" to find out for sure. &nbsp;The only way that any reward or consequence can be effective is if it is consistently implemented. 
<BR>
<BR>Over-application of time out can also cause its own set of difficulties. &nbsp;For some people, time out becomes the answer to everything. &nbsp;A child who hits someone else goes to time out, and so does a child who won't share a toy. &nbsp;A child who uses bad language is sent to time out, and so is the one who will not follow directions.&nbsp; Time out becomes the one and only technique used to manage behavior.&nbsp; And of course, that generally does not work. For one thing, there is no one-size-fits-all consequence. &nbsp;The consequence that one child finds meaningful will have absolutely no effect on the child who sits next to him or her. Therefore, using time out for all children makes little sense! &nbsp;In order to be meaningful, the consequences and rewards implemented have to be individualized. &nbsp;In fact, some children actually like time out. &nbsp;It can become a way to avoid undesirable activities or to escape demands that are difficult. 
<BR>
<BR>Time out is also not really intended to be a punitive situation, but rather a neutral one. &nbsp;Isolating a child and preventing him or her from participating in activities that would otherwise be happening is not really the goal of time out. &nbsp;Instead, it is supposed to be an opportunity to calm frazzled emotions, to ease frustration and to soothe the individual. &nbsp;It's a chance to get away from whatever is causing the problem and gain a more clear perspective about how to go about solving it. &nbsp;For this reason, many parents and caregivers have moved to using time out areas that are more pleasant, with outlets for strong emotions ready and waiting for use. &nbsp;Examples would be pillows to punch and art supplies to express strong feelings. &nbsp;This sort of time out can be used to help a child learn to cope with feelings and develop self-control. &nbsp;Time out, in this case, is not mandated by a behavior plan, but is rather a choice that the child makes. &nbsp;If he or she feels emotional control slipping, the time out area is available for regaining control. &nbsp;The child chooses when to go into time out and when to come out of the area, ready to face the world once again. 
<BR>
<BR>Whatever choices you make about using time out with children in your family or your care, remember that your job is to guide the kids to greater self-control, improved understanding of behavioral expectations, and respect for others and belongings. &nbsp;Make sure that the ways you use time out are accomplishing those goals.</FONT>
