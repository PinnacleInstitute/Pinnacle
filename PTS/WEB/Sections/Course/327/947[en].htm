<FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Everyone has a slightly different idea of what discipline and behavior management are all about. Some will tell you that the purpose is to teach the child right from wrong. Others wish to keep the peace in their home or group. There are people who feel that discipline is more for the benefit of adults than children; after all, well-disciplined children make adult lives much easier in the long run. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Actually, behavior management and discipline exist for a combination of all of these reasons. Children are not born knowing and understanding society's rules. These rules must be taught over time as children grow and mature. The true goal of discipline and behavior management is to help children develop the internal control systems that will cause them to obey society's rules and laws. They must learn to govern their own behavior eventually! Adults who are still behaving in correct ways because they fear outside consequences do not get far in life, because they will behave differently when they judge that the chance of getting caught is minimal. On the other hand, adults who have developed that internal control system will behave in a consistent manner no matter who is watching. This is what we want for our children! </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Parents and caregivers are also responsible for the family or group. They must create a safe environment where everyone can work and play. This is another reason to teach children acceptable codes of behavior. And this is not limited to avoiding violent behavior, either. Children must learn to respect property and to treat others in polite and respectful ways. The home, classroom, or care setting must be emotionally safe as well as physically safe for all concerned. This is another reason to teach children proper behavior. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The first task, now that we've defined our goal, is to understand how behavior works. It's really pretty simple. There are a number of rules that behavior nearly always follows. If we can learn them, we are well on the way to understanding how to change undesirable behaviors. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>First of all, behavior is always purposeful. We're all like this. There is no behavior without purpose. The person doing the action is always trying to achieve a goal or avoid a negative outcome. Some behaviors are attempts to liven up life (relieve boredom), and others are trying to satisfy curiosity. Some behaviors are pleas for attention in disguise or expressing a desire for someone's approval. Even adult behavior is purposeful: we work to get money, we wash the dishes to avoid getting sick, and we go to bed on time to feel good the next morning. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Secondly, behavior that has desirable outcomes will begin to happen more often. Behavior that has undesirable outcomes will gradually disappear, because it is unsuccessful. Like I said before, most of us work to receive a paycheck. That’s the positive outcome. What would happen if the paychecks stopped coming? The reward is no longer there, and the behavior would change. Try it yourself and see! Choose a coworker, close friend, or family member. Pick something that they do that you like and would like them to do more. Each time they do it, smile or praise them, or offer some positive feedback. It won't take long for the behavior to begin to happen more and more often. We actually did this in a college class, long ago. A professor used the word 'bizarre' quite a bit in his lectures. The class decided to increase that behavior. Each time he said 'bizarre,' we sat up and paid attention. We took notes (or at least pretended to!), and made eye contact. These were all very rewarding outcomes for a public speaker, and it took about three lectures before the professor's use of the word 'bizarre' increased from twice an hour to nearly ten times an hour. It works! </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Another important point to remember about behavior is that the definition of desirable and unpleasant outcomes will vary from person to person. What one person will work to achieve may be completely negative for another person. I'm reminded of a story that a participant in one of my workshops told one evening. This care provider was concerned about a child's behavior and searching for answers to change it. The girl screamed whenever activities were changed in class. She acted very upset, and the teachers assumed that she was having difficulty with transitions. I asked how they responded to the screaming behavior, and was told that they removed the child from the group and walked her up and down the hallway to help her calm down. And even as the answer was given, I could see the proverbial lightbulb going off. The teacher realized that this little girl had found a way to get lots of positive attention every time the class changed activities! We have to be sure that the outcome of the behavior is desirable for behaviors that we want to increase and not so desirable for behaviors we're trying to change. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Immediate rewards are more powerful and important than delayed rewards. If a child is misbehaving to get attention, the other children's immediate response is likely to be a more powerful reward than the negative consequence that you implement later. This can cause some real problems in changing behavior, and it's very important to be aware of. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>A related principle is that tangible rewards are more powerful than intangible. Things that the child can hold in his or her hand are usually more meaningful than the reward of the good feeling you get inside when you follow the rules. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Finally, younger children and those with special needs (such as developmental delays, emotional problems, or ADHD) will need more powerful and more frequent rewards to change their behavior. This will affect the way that you plan a behavior management program. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>These principles, if you keep them in mind, will help you to develop effective ways to change children's behavior. We can use them as we analyze situations, identify problem behaviors, and develop plans to change them. And it IS important to have a plan, an organized approach to changing undesirable behavior. Without planning, we find ourselves falling back on the same techniques, whether or not they are doing the job. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The mechanics of behavior management are simple. The first step is to clearly state the undesirable behavior. This name must be specific, observable, and measurable. If I were to walk into the situation, there should be no doubt in my mind what you are talking about. One of the common mistakes adults make at this step is being vague about the behavior that needs to change. Words like naughty, snotty, and bad are not specific, observable, and measurable. The definitions will vary from person to person. My idea of naughty behavior may be totally different than yours. The amount I'm willing to tolerate will also be different than yours. We won't be able to count how many times the child 'was naughty.' Instead, use behavior names that are specific: hitting, biting, shouting, or taking toys from others are very specific. We all would agree when they were happening. This is the kind of behavior naming that will help change behavior! </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Secondly, we need to try to identify the causes and effects of the behavior. Why is the child doing this? What is his or her goal? What is rewarding the behavior so that the child feels like the goal was accomplished? What are the circumstances when the behavior crops up? The more information we can gather about the when, where, and how, the better. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Finally, it's time to change either the cause of the behavior or the outcome. You can manipulate the cause by meeting a previously unmet need (like paying extra attention to the child BEFORE he or she acts out to get attention), by changing the class or family schedule (planning a quiet, calm-down activity before bed instead of allowing a lot of excitement), or by separating children who are showing signs of interpersonal difficulties. Change the outcome by controlling what happens right after the behavior. Have a consequence in mind and implement it immediately. Make sure that it's meaningful to the child. We don't want this undesirable behavior to achieve its intended goal. Be sure to keep records of your efforts! That's the only way you'll know for sure if the changes you've made are working. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There are a few other tips, as well. It's important to realize that positive consequences are far more powerful for most children than negative ones. Discover what is positive to the child and find a way to arrange that as an outcome of the behavior you desire. Frequency is also very important as well. Begin with frequent rewards for the behavior you want, and then gradually taper them off. Consistency is vital. Do what you say you will do. Always follow through. You will do incredible amounts of damage and undermine your own program if you promise rewards or consequences and then don't deliver. And finally, plan ahead. Tell the child what behavior you want to eliminate or reduce, what cue or warning that you will use to let him or her know that you're seeing behavior that you don't want, what the consequence for the behavior will be, and what the reward for changing it will be. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There you have it! These are the basics of behavior management. The next lesson will cover some positive techniques to change behavior, since they are so much more powerful than negative ones. Subsequent lessons will look at specific pesky behavior problems, apply these techniques, and offer practical solutions to try in your home or classroom. </FONT>
