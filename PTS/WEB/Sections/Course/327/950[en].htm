Time out is probably the most well-used tool in adults' behavior management arsenal. From the toddler who is placed on a "thinking chair" to the elementary-aged student who is sent to his or her room, and even to the high school student sentenced to in-school suspension, some form of time out is used as a consequence. &nbsp;Of course, you now know that there is no effective, one-size-fits-all consequence. Remember (from Lesson One) that every individual has a unique array of things they find rewarding and discouraging. We all need to consider alternative rewards and consequences, a menu specially chosen 
<BR>for each child. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>Particularly if undesirable behaviors are not decreasing or disappearing when you use time out, it's time to consider alternatives. &nbsp;It is easy to settle into a pattern of enforcing time out because of its convenience and familiarity. &nbsp;We lose sight of the goals – to change behavior and to teach self-control. &nbsp;If time out is not aiding in the accomplishment of these goals, then it is time to reassess its use. 
<BR>
<BR>For example, I once worked with a middle-school boy who had serious behavior problems. &nbsp;Of particular concern was his use of foul language directed at his teachers. &nbsp;The school principal repeatedly put him in the in-school suspension system because this was the standard consequence for such behavior. &nbsp;However, this child did not find in-school suspension to be unpleasant. &nbsp;In that setting, he was placed in a calm environment, given extra help with his schoolwork, and did not have to face taunting from his peers about his special needs. &nbsp;You'll never guess what happened! &nbsp;Each time this student returned from in-school suspension, he cursed at the first teacher he saw. &nbsp;His cursing actually increased because he found the outcome to be desirable. &nbsp;The school administrators were very rigid - the consequence for cursing at teachers was in-school suspension, and they could not see any way to deviate from that even though it obviously was not effective. 
<BR>
<BR>You, however, have more flexibility in how you deal with problem behavior. &nbsp;If time out (or any other option) is not effective in changing behavior, you can change your response. &nbsp;You simply need to develop a menu of alternative possibilities for both positive and negative consequences. 
<BR>
<BR>Let's look first at creative rewards. &nbsp;Remember that tangible rewards are the most powerful tool in your arsenal, and are particularly useful for the very young and those with special needs. &nbsp;Tangible rewards, things that can be touched, include items such as raisins, candy, stickers or toys. &nbsp;What sort of tangible rewards would be important to your child? &nbsp;Raisins wouldn't be good rewards for a child who doesn't like them. &nbsp;Make a list of at least five different things that might be good tangible rewards for your child right now. Remember that tangible rewards can be small and frequently supplied, or they can be larger items, earned over time. &nbsp;And it's ok to ask your child for suggestions. &nbsp;What would he or she like to earn? 
<BR>
<BR>Rewards can also be intangible. &nbsp;These are things that cannot be touched, but children will work for them nonetheless. &nbsp;Intangible rewards include things such as privileges, activities and your attention. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>Your attention is probably the most powerful tool that you can use. Children are constantly vying for it, and they will work hard to get and hold onto it. &nbsp;You can give your attention in lots of ways and settings, from eating together to sharing a story to playing a game to taking a trip. &nbsp;Almost anything will do, even chores! &nbsp;The key is to 
<BR>give undivided attention to your child. &nbsp;Turn the phone off, put the housework aside, and make yourself unavailable for other pursuits. Your kids will treasure these times and so will you. &nbsp;Make a list right now of at least five ways that you could give attention that your child would especially enjoy. 
<BR>
<BR>Privileges are generally inexpensive and easily provided. &nbsp;The key is to remember that nearly anything your child wants to do is really a privilege. &nbsp;Watching television, using toys or art supplies, playing computer or video games, talking on the phone or seeing friends are all privileges and can be earned. &nbsp;Make a list right now of at least five privileges that would be motivating for your child. 
<BR>
<BR>There is quite a list of possible privileges. &nbsp;This list is by no means exhaustive, but should start your creative wheels turning.&nbsp; Choose privileges that are convenient and easily provided so that you can freely implement them. &nbsp;How about adjustments in bedtime, naptime or wake-up time? &nbsp;Even five minutes will work with young kids.&nbsp; Consider providing special foods, allowing meals or snacks in unusual places, or changing the usual seating arrangement. &nbsp;You can create a privilege around use of play dough, special dishes or cups, or opportunities to use coveted toys. &nbsp;In short, privileges are permission to use or do nearly anything the child values. 
<BR>
<BR>Let's take a look at the flip side of the coin now. &nbsp;Consequences also need to be meaningful to the child in order to be motivating for change. &nbsp;It's very easy to fall into a pattern of using time out as an all-purpose consequence, but that generally does not work well. &nbsp;Kids get used to it and even come to expect it. &nbsp;They may even decide that the misdeed is "worth it." &nbsp;Let's create a menu of possible consequences to use with your list of positive responses. 
<BR>
<BR>Consequences also come in a number of different types. &nbsp;We can either remove something positive from the child's life, or add something mildly aversive. &nbsp;Time out and lecturing are examples of adding something aversive. &nbsp;Taking away privileges or things are examples of removing something positive. &nbsp;Make a quick list right now of five things that you could deny access to as a consequence. &nbsp;Make sure that the things you choose are important and meaningful to the child. &nbsp;Make another list of at least five privileges or activities that are important to your child and that you have the power to delay or&nbsp;withhold. &nbsp;These also need to be important to the child. &nbsp;What mildly aversive things could you implement? &nbsp;Make a list of those, too. 
<BR>
<BR>There are additional mildly aversive consequences that you may wish to consider. &nbsp;Extra chores are generally considered a negative outcome. Boring or repetitive tasks can also be a deterrent. &nbsp;Got toys that need to be sorted, puzzles that need to be assembled, socks that need to be mated? &nbsp;These would all be possibilities for boring and repetitive tasks that may serve as behavior tools. 
<BR>
<BR>Now's a great time for a quick word about the difference between earning privileges and taking them away. &nbsp;I'd like to stress that positive management techniques are far more effective with most children. &nbsp;Therefore, I'm much more likely to offer an extra privilege for exemplary behavior than I am to remove an existing privilege in response to misbehavior. &nbsp;You know this as the "If-Then" rule. &nbsp;Tell your child, "If you _____, then you get to _____." &nbsp;It's a tried-and-true method that gets results quickly. 
<BR>
<BR>However, there have been times in my work with children when things have gotten so far out of control that I've felt the need to remove existing privileges. &nbsp;Generally, I remove ALL privileges at that point. &nbsp;Children no longer have the privilege of watching TV, of using the telephone, and so on. &nbsp;I tell them they can keep the privileges of eating and breathing. &nbsp;Then I clearly outline how they can "earn" their privileges back, and in what order the privileges will be returned. &nbsp;This method has worked well for me over the years. 
<BR>
<BR>And I've developed special ways of responding to a few especially troublesome behaviors that I'd like to share with you at this point. One of my daughters would misbehave, and then make a conscious choice about whether the promised consequence was worthwhile. &nbsp;She often decided that it was and made a decision to continue with the unacceptable behavior and accept the punishment a few moments later. I solved this problem by creating a list of six consequences that were most meaningful to her. &nbsp;When she needed a reminder that her behavior was unacceptable and that a consequence would be implemented if she did not change, I told her I would roll a die to choose the consequence. &nbsp;Rolling the die BECAME the consequence! &nbsp;She couldn't make an informed decision about whether the outcome was worthwhile, because she didn't know how the roll would turn out. &nbsp;It was remarkable how well the technique worked for her. 
<BR>
<BR>I'm sure that everyone has experienced rude behavior from their young children as well. &nbsp;To curb this, I told the children that their behavior had hurt my feelings and I didn't want to be around them just then. &nbsp;I took care of their basic needs, like fixing meals and helping with toileting, but did not make eye contact, chat or play games as I generally do. &nbsp;Five to 15 minutes of this "cold shoulder" seemed to be effective for the youngsters when they were preschool and young elementary age. 
<BR>
<BR>Teens can be another whole ballpark though, can't they? &nbsp;I have two teens in the house currently, and one who is rapidly approaching that stage. &nbsp;One of my pet peeves has been the accusation that I never (insert whatever they're upset about here). &nbsp;Over the past few years, I've been accused of never spending any time with them, never taking them anywhere, never allowing them choices and so forth. &nbsp;I decided to correct that misassumption by showing them for a day or so what that would really feel like. &nbsp;When accused, I told them they were very confused, and needed to see what life would truly be like if I acted as they said. &nbsp;It proved to be highly effective! 
<BR>
<BR>And finally, I've got an effective method of responding to sullen, angry people who refuse to speak to me for extended periods. &nbsp;When children try this tactic on me, I don't scold or reprimand them. &nbsp;I allow about 24 hours for them to get over the mad, but then if they continue, I reprimand them for not sticking to their principles better. &nbsp;After all, if they are so angry that they don't wish to speak to me, then they should also follow through with doing their own laundry, refusing rides home from school, declining family outings and so forth. &nbsp;They are given a choice to either carry their cold shoulder to the ultimate ends or to lighten up and resume more normal interactions. &nbsp;Guess which they choose? 
<BR>
<BR>You can see that there are many, many ways to respond to behavior in addition to our tried-and-true standards, such as time out. &nbsp;I hope that you will make a complete menu of ideas to try, and then implement them. &nbsp;You are the adult and you are in charge. &nbsp;It's up to you to keep it that way!
