Every group leader, care-giver and parent has seen them. &nbsp;If they are not part of your group or family, you have seen them around in other classes, in the grocery store or at the park. &nbsp;They are the children who are labeled "difficult." &nbsp;Difficult children are the ones who challenge authority, the ones who do not seem to respond to our usual behavior management techniques, or the ones who seem out of step or isolated because of their behavior. &nbsp;If you have regular contact with one of these children, you are likely to feel stressed and overwhelmed. &nbsp;It may seem like nothing you say or do is working to change the troublesome behaviors. &nbsp;Don't give up! 
<BR>
<BR>Remember that all behavior has a reason. No one (adult or child) does anything "just because." &nbsp;Every behavior has a purpose and it's not usually to make life difficult for the care-giver, parent or teacher. &nbsp;Children engage in troublesome behaviors because these strategies either are successful for them, or because they have been successful in the past. &nbsp;The behavior, in their eyes, serves some purpose. &nbsp;It is human nature to repeat behaviors that achieve goals and avoid an unpleasant outcome. &nbsp;Our job, as parents, teachers and care-givers, is to discover the underlying reason for the behavior and then find a way to meet the needs in a more positive way or change the behavior's outcome so that it is no longer successful. 
<BR>
<BR>It is important to remember that many of these behaviors are habitual. &nbsp;Like any other habit, they may have outlived their original purpose, but are tough to get rid of. &nbsp;And like any other habit, they need powerful forces to change them. &nbsp;The troublesome behaviors may also be successful in other settings, such as home, school or daycare. &nbsp;When a behavior is successful even part of the time, most people will apply it in other situations, hoping for more success. 
<BR>
<BR>Remember, too, that the incidence of troublesome behavior will often increase when you try a new management strategy. &nbsp;This is because some children need to test the limits and be sure you will respond in the same ways over time. &nbsp;Be consistent! &nbsp;The message will get through. Positive techniques are generally more successful than negative as well. &nbsp;Be sure your positive exchanges with the child far outnumber the negative ones. Not only is this more effective, it is also dramatically less stressful for everyone. &nbsp;Awareness of these factors should help you to plan behavior management strategies more effectively. 
<BR>
<BR>When you are faced with a child who seems "difficult," there is an effective strategy to help him or her change the troublesome behavior. &nbsp;The first step is to describe the behavior completely and objectively. &nbsp;Be sure to use observable words for this, and don't leave any room for opinion. &nbsp;Every adult who is watching should be able to say whether the behavior happened or not. &nbsp;Separate the person from the behavior. &nbsp;Behaviors are troublesome, difficult or wrong. Children are not. &nbsp;Secondly, consider what needs may be motivating the behavior. &nbsp;Remember, there is some reason for the child to be acting that way. &nbsp;Figure out what is making the behavior seem successful and worthwhile to the child. &nbsp;When and where is the behavior working? 
<BR>
<BR>Once you've gathered information about the situation, examine your own responses. &nbsp;Sometimes we inadvertently undermine kids by responding with counterproductive actions. &nbsp;For example, it is easy to give extra attention to a child who acts out to gain attention. &nbsp;Finally, when all the pieces of the puzzle are in place, it's time to design a behavior plan. &nbsp;Outline more acceptable ways to help the child meet his or her needs, consider options for preventing problem situations, decide on an appropriate response to the target behavior, and plan lots of ways to provide positive reinforcement. 
<BR>
<BR>Now, let's take a closer look at several types of troublesome behaviors that can cause children to be labeled "difficult." &nbsp;For each one, you will find suggestions about possible underlying needs, common ways that adults can accidentally undermine the process of change, and possible management techniques to try. 
<BR>
<BR>Perhaps the most vocal group of difficult children are the ones who consistently challenge adult authority. &nbsp;All children do this at times because it is a natural part of learning limits and seeking independence. &nbsp;A few, however, seem to fight everything they are asked to do. &nbsp;These children refuse to follow directions, break rules, boss other children, and may even make rude responses when corrected. Adults often find them aggravating and feel the kids are trying their best to be annoying. &nbsp;They often find themselves involved in power struggles with these kids, and many times, the kids win. 
<BR>
<BR>Sometimes unmet needs can cause this type of behavior. &nbsp;The child may have an unmet need to control situations or other people. &nbsp;You can meet this in a more positive way by providing opportunities for leadership. &nbsp;Try allowing the youngster to choose games or books for the group or to lead activities such as exercises or games. &nbsp;Some children have an unmet need for self-determination. &nbsp;This can be met by offering age-appropriate choices whenever possible. &nbsp;Young children may be offered a choice of watching a video or doing a puzzle during quiet time. &nbsp;Older children can be given more choices as they show they can handle that. &nbsp;Finally, a child may have an unmet need for control of the environment. &nbsp;Meet this need by allowing choices of where activities are completed. They may also benefit from making decisions about furniture arrangement or storage of toys. 
<BR>
<BR>When we examine our usual responses, we may see things that perpetuate this troublesome behavior instead of eliminating it. &nbsp;Children who challenge authority may enjoy the reaction they get from adults. &nbsp;The solution is to make that response less interesting. &nbsp;Ignoring this behavior, or matter-of-factly enforcing your chosen consequence may be a better way to react. 
<BR>
<BR>Children also may challenge authority because they get results. &nbsp;Do not give in to this child's bid to run the show. &nbsp;Make sure that whatever action, activity or consequence that you have set happens. Kids really do like the secure feeling of knowing that adults are in charge. &nbsp;If you cave in to these children or allow their behavior to control what you do or do not do with them, they have won. 
<BR>
<BR>Children who challenge authority may also enjoy the attention they elicit from others. &nbsp;Even if adults control their reactions, other children do not always do so. &nbsp;You can remove the opportunity for attention by removing the child from the group (as in time out, cool down areas or similar methods), or by removing the rest of the group. &nbsp;Invite them to take a walk, get a drink, or start a new activity with the children who are cooperating and behaving appropriately. 
<BR>
<BR>Specific management techniques will help with children who challenge authority. &nbsp;Make sure any unmet needs that you've found are resolved. Look for patterns that trigger the unacceptable behavior and signals that the child is heading for trouble. &nbsp;Use this information to stop problems before they begin. &nbsp;Finally, be sure that your rules are clear, your rewards and consequences are effective, and your follow-through is consistent. 
<BR>
<BR>Another type of behavior that adults find extremely troubling comes from children who don't seem to respond to our usual behavior management techniques. &nbsp;These kids don't seem to be affected by the usual consequences. &nbsp;They may laugh at the consequences that you choose to use. &nbsp;They often make adults feel very angry and frustrated. &nbsp;It feels like they are intentionally making life miserable for their parents, teachers and care-givers. 
<BR>
<BR>These children may have unmet needs that affect their behavior. &nbsp;One is a need for clear and consistent boundaries. &nbsp;They need to know what is and is not acceptable behavior. &nbsp;If expectations are not clear and consistent in all settings, the child may exhibit seemingly intractable behavior problems. &nbsp;This can make a very difficult situation when you are being consistent and other adults in other situations in the child's life are not. &nbsp;Most children can eventually learn behavioral expectations specific to your setting, but it will take extra time and patience. &nbsp;Do not give up! 
<BR>
<BR>Children also need lots of positive recognition, and they need it in far greater quantities than they receive negative attention. &nbsp;If you find yourself in a negative pattern with a child, make a concerted effort to offer even more positive attention. 
<BR>
<BR>Self-fulfilling prophecy is a very real problem. &nbsp;Try not to pre-judge a child based on what you have heard previously or based on a sibling's behavior. &nbsp;Kids can easily become discouraged and feel that their efforts are futile if others don't give them a chance to demonstrate that they have changed or are different than another child. &nbsp;They begin to wonder why they should bother trying to change their behavior if no one notices or they continually are blamed for things they did not do. 
<BR>
<BR>When examining your own responses, here are some things to look for. It's important to document exactly what is going on when you're finding a particular child's behavior to be consistently troublesome. Write down what happens and when so that you can get a clear picture of how often the behavior is being exhibited. &nbsp;Keep records with anecdotes, charts, or whatever you like to use so that you can see if there are patterns or changes. 
<BR>
<BR>Consistency is your best tool with this type of difficult behavior. Close examination may reveal that you are not responding as consistently as you would like. &nbsp;Be sure that all of your responses are in line with your stated rules, consequences and rewards. &nbsp;It's perhaps even more important to be consistent with the positive responses than it is with the negative ones. 
<BR>
<BR>Communication with the other adults in the child's life, including parents, teachers and care-givers, can make a world of difference. You may also wish to include group advisors, coaches and so forth, so that every adult working with the child in every setting has the same set of expectations and outcomes for behavior. &nbsp;Strive for consistent responses in all settings in which the child is involved. 
<BR>
<BR>There are a few specific behavior management techniques that can help with children who seem unaffected by your usual strategies. Successive approximation is a technique where the child's behavior is changed gradually. &nbsp;Begin by charting the frequency of the objectionable behavior. &nbsp;Set a goal for reducing its incidence gradually. &nbsp;For example, if a behavior happens five times daily, reward the child for reducing the number of occurrences to three incidences. &nbsp;When the behavior appears only three times daily on a consistent basis, reduce the target number to two, and so forth. 
<BR>
<BR>It is also very important to be sure that the rewards and consequences that you choose to use in your behavior plan are meaningful to the child. &nbsp;It is very easy to use a familiar tool, like time out or rewarding with stickers, that is meaningless to that particular child. &nbsp;Develop a LONG list of rewards and consequences, and watch the individual for clues about important privileges and negative outcomes. 
<BR>
<BR>Finally, let's take a look at the child who seems out of step with the group. &nbsp;Many adults are troubled by this sort of behavior because they perceive the child to be isolated and lonely. &nbsp;These children frequently play alone, are sometimes teased and bullied, and may have low self-esteem. &nbsp;Sometimes, the child engages in behavior that causes him or her to be ridiculed. &nbsp;Whatever the case, it seems as though this child does not fit in well with the rest of the children. 
<BR>
<BR>There may be unmet needs causing the situation that you can address. Everyone needs positive attention, and this child may not be getting enough of it during the normal interactions of the day. &nbsp;Perhaps you could arrange opportunities for the child to shine and be recognized for a valuable or interesting skill. &nbsp;The child may also simply need more alone time than others of similar age and circumstances, and that's ok. &nbsp;You may need to help that happen in a positive and productive way. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>Sometimes, isolated children need more information about the expectations of others. &nbsp;For example, a child who is new to group settings may not realize the social rules involved in being chosen to do a special job. &nbsp;The child may need specific training in how to be a good friend. &nbsp;Social skills develop at different paces in different children, and some children catch on to the social graces much more quickly than others. &nbsp;Perhaps you could help the isolated child develop the skills he or she is missing that are interfering with the development of friendships. &nbsp;Finally, some isolated children may need help in developing appropriate strategies and responses to others' inappropriate behavior. &nbsp;A child who is being bullied may need encouragement and training to know when and how to bring the problem to an adult's attention, for example. 
<BR>
<BR>We also need to evaluate our own responses when working with a child who seems isolated or out of step with the others. &nbsp;First of all, make sure that what you perceive as a problem really is a problem. &nbsp;Some children really are happier with a quieter time, away from the limelight and with less attention. &nbsp;This is perfectly ok, as long as it is happening because of the child's preferences rather than because of factors outside of the child's control. &nbsp;It is also important to consider whether you are expecting or even forcing the child to interact in ways that he or she is not ready for. &nbsp;Perhaps the emotional and social skills are not yet in place for the type of interaction that you are expecting. &nbsp;Finally, be sure that you are enforcing the guidelines of fair play and civil behavior with all children all of the time. &nbsp;We sometimes overlook infractions of popular or good-looking or normally well-behaved children without meaning to. &nbsp;There are also some subconscious differences in the way most people treat boys and girls that should be examined. 
<BR>
<BR>Some specific behavior management tools that may help in circumstances that involve isolated children include many forms of modeling. &nbsp;Model the behavior that you would like to see increased. &nbsp;If you would like to see a child become more involved with peers, for example, interact more with the children yourself. &nbsp;You can also role-play troublesome situations and suggest strategies for dealing with them. &nbsp;Allow the kids to practice these through puppetry, skits, stories and so forth. &nbsp;Be sure you are modeling respectful behavior at all times, too. &nbsp;The way we treat others should show that each individual is a worthy human being with rights and needs just like everyone else. 
<BR>
<BR>Use a compliment box, child of the week, or other positive attention techniques to help children get to know one another better. &nbsp;Some groups respond well to group sessions where everyone finds one positive thing to say about their classmate or sibling. &nbsp;Show and tell or similar activities gives each child a chance to shine and have the entire group's attention in a positive way. 
<BR>
<BR>Finally, it may help to talk privately with a child who is behaving in ways that others in the group are not accepting. &nbsp;Find an outlet for the unacceptable behavior in a private place or at a more acceptable time. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>There you have it: strategies to help you deal with the worst of the troublesome behaviors that often cause children to be labeled "difficult." Like all behaviors, these have reasons and they also have solutions. &nbsp;They just take a bit more persistence and consistency to resolve, and perhaps a closer look at what may be motivating the behavior. &nbsp;You can do this! &nbsp;You have the tools, and you understand that if your first behavior plan doesn't work the way that you expect, you have the freedom to go back to the drawing board and try again. &nbsp;With time and patience, you can help even the most difficult child become a positive citizen and learn the necessary behavioral skills to be successful in group situations.
