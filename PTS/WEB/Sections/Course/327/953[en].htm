Congratulations! &nbsp;You're nearly finished with class. &nbsp;This seventh and final lesson is intended to help you put everything together and discover how to best apply the concepts in your circumstances. &nbsp;You've learned that behavior is always purposeful, that adults can discover what that purpose is and take steps to provide the outcome in a more acceptable way or interrupt the process so that the behavior is no longer successful. &nbsp;You know now that positive management methods are far more effective than negative ones, and that consistency is your best tool. &nbsp;You understand that you should follow through and provide consequences and rewards that you have promised. &nbsp;Good job! 
<BR>
<BR>Let's put all of this into action now with some solid suggestions that work in everyday life. &nbsp;This lesson will cover ideas related to heading off behavior problems before they start, focusing on positive management, using games to manage behavior, and teaching conflict resolution and anger management skills to young children. 
<BR>
<BR>Many, many troublesome behaviors can be avoided with planning and forethought. &nbsp;Sometimes we actually set kids up for behavior problems without even thinking about it. &nbsp;Instead, we could be "heading 'em off at the pass" so to speak. &nbsp;We can avoid potential behavior problems by the way we structure activities and schedules, arrange people, furniture and objects, and by planning for difficult times, such as transitions. &nbsp;If you analyze your day, you may see specific times or places where behavior seems to always pass acceptable limits. &nbsp;These times and places are prone to causing disruptive or inappropriate behavior. &nbsp;Discover these trends by keeping a diary for a few days. Which parts of the day go well and which do not? &nbsp;What time of day did you notice feeling more negative than positive? &nbsp;What was everyone doing when they seemed to forget every rule in the book? &nbsp;Who was interacting with whom when the kids started bickering? &nbsp;After a few days of noticing such details, a pattern may begin to emerge. &nbsp;Perhaps a few children are having trouble getting along. &nbsp;Maybe the entire group loses control right before lunchtime. &nbsp;Maybe you have difficulty regaining their attention after large muscle activities or active play. &nbsp;Whatever the case may be, once you see the pattern, you can begin to take steps toward a cure. 
<BR>
<BR>The activities that everyone engages in have a profound impact on the mood of the group. &nbsp;You've no doubt noticed that a day spent lazing around watching videos tends to leave everyone feeling differently than a day spent at the beach or walking in the woods. &nbsp;Some activities excite kids and others are more soothing. &nbsp;Some activities encourage competition, and others require cooperation and teamwork. Some activities allow individual creativity to shine through while others are exercises in following directions. &nbsp;There is a place for all of these types of activities in your day; all of them are beneficial in different ways. &nbsp;The key is to be aware of what type of activity you are choosing and make it match the group's needs and personality. &nbsp;You can adjust to those needs by changing what you had planned. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>Try developing a selection of ideas that suit different needs and perhaps preparing them in advance so that they are ready to use when you need them. &nbsp;An example might be a box of books, some exciting to read, some silly to cheer up a glum day, some soothing, such as poetry. &nbsp;Music works as well - lively, active marching music to pep things up, classical pieces for background, quiet songs to tone everyone down when needed. 
<BR>
<BR>You may also be able to head off behavior problems by rearranging. Watch closely and you can often spot trouble before it begins. &nbsp;Two children head for the same toy at the same time. &nbsp;Little Suzy is in a bad mood when she gets up. &nbsp;James is feeling frustrated because his art project didn't turn out the way he expected. &nbsp;Titus didn't nap well. &nbsp;Many problems send out signals before they become behavior issues, and sometimes it's possible to prevent them from escalating. You may find that you can distract one child from a problem. &nbsp;You may be able to offer a different toy, invite the child to read a book with you, send him or her to a different playmate, or create a job for the child to do. 
<BR>
<BR>It's also possible to rearrange the furniture or toys to minimize problems. &nbsp;Perhaps the kitchen area is too close to the toy cars, and users of the kitchen are becoming frustrated with cars whizzing around their feet as they play house. &nbsp;Maybe the television is too close to the place where your other child likes to go for peace and quiet to read. &nbsp;Do you need a physical divider to mark off "territory"? You can also rearrange people to head off potential behavior problems. Separate children who are having difficulties agreeing. &nbsp;Put a distractible child in a quiet corner. &nbsp;Move a child who is having difficulty controlling his or her temper closer to you. &nbsp;You can also move around the area and, by your presence, deter some problems. 
<BR>
<BR>Transitions can be tricky times with any group of children. &nbsp;Some children become very frustrated when they feel they do not have time to finish a project. &nbsp;Others simply want to continue an activity until THEY decide they are done. &nbsp;A child may get distracted by the change and not hear or follow the directions. &nbsp;Some have trouble cleaning up; others use the opportunity to disrupt the group. &nbsp;Head off potential problems by planning your transition times as carefully as you would other activities! &nbsp;Check back to Lesson Two for the complete list of tips to help improve transition times. 
<BR>
<BR>Focusing on positive management techniques can be easier said than done, especially if you've been feeling negative for a while. &nbsp;Make a list of positive phrases that you could use with kids, such as "I'm proud of you," "That's interesting," "That was a good idea," "You sure are creative," "I know I can count on you," and "How did you ever come up with that idea?" &nbsp;Look for times and places to use your positive comments, such as when a single child is behaving well or thanking the group who is following rules or directions. &nbsp;Try to make a habit of using positive phrases as much as possible. &nbsp;One strategy is to set a goal for yourself to compliment each child a certain number of times each and every day. 
<BR>
<BR>Help yourself to look on the bright side of behavior by keeping a diary, or even having someone else (like a spouse or coworker) jot down what positive techniques they see you use. &nbsp;If you don't have another adult partner to help you out, try using a tape recorder to check your own performance and see if you've met your goals. 
<BR>
<BR>It can be fun to use games to manage behavior, and this can help put the focus back onto the positive side of the field. &nbsp;Here are a few ideas that you can try: 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Design a Distraction 
<BR>Develop a collection of resource ideas that you can use to rescue a bad day. &nbsp;Diversions such as an engaging game, a favorite piece of music, an impromptu craft, or a special story are all possibilities. Some parents and care-givers even keep a special stash of toys that are unfamiliar and seem new to the children. &nbsp;These are only brought out when the day seems to be a rough one. 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Relaxation Exercises 
<BR>Teach deep breathing, counting to ten, muscle tense and relax, and other appropriate, simple relaxation exercises. &nbsp;A very simple one that even the youngest children can do is called "Palming." &nbsp;Rub your hands together hard and fast to make them warm from friction. &nbsp;Now, place the warm palms on closed eyelids. &nbsp;The feeling is very soothing. &nbsp;Prompt the use of these techniques when individuals are losing their self-control. 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Positive Self-Talk 
<BR>Teach children to verbalize their goals in troublesome areas. &nbsp;Help them remind themselves of positive actions. &nbsp;Examples include saying things like "I can handle this," "I can solve this problem," and "I can use kind words." 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Cool-Off Activities 
<BR>Provide simple, repetitive activities that can help children regain control of emotions. &nbsp;Examples include sorting or matching tasks, cleaning tasks or movement tasks. 
<BR>
<BR>• &nbsp; &nbsp;Role Play and Drama 
<BR>Use puppets and other dramatic props to encourage children to verbalize feelings and thoughts. 
<BR>
<BR>Since many troublesome behaviors have their roots in anger and conflict, let's take a closer look at how to help children develop anger management and conflict-resolution skills. &nbsp;Kids, particularly young ones, often have inordinate amounts of difficulty recognizing and understanding the feelings they have inside. &nbsp;Even highly verbal and articulate children can have this difficulty, and so can older children and teens. &nbsp;It's very important that we adults help them find words to express their feelings and find appropriate outlets for the strong ones. &nbsp; 
<BR>
<BR>It can be helpful to consider what kind of anger you are seeing. &nbsp;Is it related to discomfort? &nbsp;You can try to fix the problem. &nbsp;Is it from frustration? &nbsp;Perhaps the child feels his/her skills and abilities don't measure up to his/her aspirations. &nbsp;Often this type of anger can be related to motor or language skills. &nbsp;Try teaching new skills, changing activities or help the child with a tough step. &nbsp;The anger might be assertive in nature. &nbsp;A child becomes angry over thwarted plans or over-ruled desires. &nbsp;You may be able to help if you can offer other outlets for independence and only give choices where they truly exist. &nbsp;Be especially careful that you don't turn commands into questions! &nbsp;Kids will often choose to answer negatively when asked, "Don't you think it's time for bed now?" &nbsp;Instead, don't set yourself up for an argument. &nbsp;Simply say, "It's time for you to go to bed." &nbsp;Sometimes, anger can be a display of unhappiness with the current situation. &nbsp;This anger blossoms when the child feels abused by another. &nbsp;He or she will sometimes try to use that as an excuse for violent or aggressive behavior. &nbsp;Avoid blame, and try to use problem-solving techniques instead. 
<BR>
<BR>Adult actions have a huge impact on how children handle anger and conflict. &nbsp;Be sure you are providing a positive role model by dealing with your anger in a positive and mature way. &nbsp;Avoid angry words, abrupt movements and harsh facial expressions. &nbsp;Not only are these scary for kids, you may find yourself looking at a reflection next time the child gets angry. &nbsp;You can assist with verbalizing feelings by reflecting them back at the child. &nbsp;Feelings are normal and human, and kids need to learn how to name them and deal with them. &nbsp;Adults can model and teach empathy, too. &nbsp;Help children see the situation from other people's perspective. &nbsp;Teach them how to communicate respectfully about feelings. 
<BR>
<BR>Literature can be a wonderful tool to help teach children about how to handle their feelings and situations of conflict. &nbsp;Read and tell stories about children experiencing similar feelings. &nbsp;Act out stories with puppets. &nbsp;Talk about how the characters in the book must be feeling. 
<BR>
<BR>Children can also be taught simple problem-solving techniques. &nbsp;Teach them to clearly state the problem in terms of how it affects all parties. &nbsp;They will need to state what their goal is, too. &nbsp;What does he or she want from the situation? &nbsp;Now, have all of the children in conflict brainstorm ways to achieve EVERYONE'S goals. &nbsp;Kids need practice at this, and you'll need to guide them at first. &nbsp;Finally, choose the best solution from the list and implement it. &nbsp;Given a chance and encouragement, children can often come up with great solutions to their own problems. &nbsp;We simply need to teach them how to begin.
