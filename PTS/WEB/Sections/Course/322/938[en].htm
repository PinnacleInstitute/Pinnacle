<BR><FONT size=3><B>The Task:</B> 
<BR>You will create a simple letter using <B>Word</B>. 
<BR>
<BR>When you are finished creating the letter, you'll save your new document and print a copy. 
<BR>Let's start: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Find and open Word 97. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> If a <B>Tip of The Day</B> dialog box is displayed, click on the <B>OK</B> button. 
<BR>
<BR>Word normally opens with a blank window and is ready to create a new document. However,if someone was using the computer before you, the window may already contain text. In that case, you'll need to open a blank window for your new document. 
<BR>
<BR>To open a blank window for a new document: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>New</B> from the <B>File</B> menu. 
<BR>
<BR>The New dialog box will appear. This dialog box allows you to select from a variety of templates and wizards.<B> <I>Templates</I></B> are preformatted skeleton documents ranging from memos to newsletters.<B> <I>Wizards</I></B> ask a series of questions about a document format and then uses your answers to build a document for you to use. Right now, you need the default general-purpose template, named Normal. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Highlight Normal and click on the <B>OK</B> button. 
<BR>
<BR>The document area of the screen will be blank except for the blinking insertion point (|) and the end mark(__). The <B><I>inserstion point</I></B> marks the position where the text will be inserted or deleted. The <B><I>end-of-document mark</I></B> (end mark) shows where the document ends. 
<BR>
<BR>Word displays several toolbars just below the menu, which allow you to use certain commands by clicking on their buttons. You can choose which toolbars you want displayed. That is, you can set up the Word screen to your liking.</FONT><CENTER><H2>Setting Up the Word Screen </H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Toolbars...</B> from the <B>View</B> menu. 
<BR>
<BR>The following Toolbars dialog box should appear: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/toolbar.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR><!-- Setting Up the Word Screen -------------><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Click in the Standard and Formatting boxes until a check mark appears in the box. 
<BR>This will display the Standard and Formatting toolbars on your screen. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Click on the <B>OK</B> button. 
<BR>
<BR>It is also a good idea to have the ruler displayed. 
<BR>To display the ruler: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Click and hold on the <B>View</B> menu. 
<BR>
<BR>If there is a check mark next to the word Ruler, then the ruler will be displayed. 
<BR>If no check mark appears next to the word Ruler, the ruler will not be displayed. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Highlight the word Ruler, to place a check mark there. 
<BR>
<BR>You also want to be in <B>Normal</B> view. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Normal</B> from the <B>View</B> menu. 
<BR>
<BR>Word also has <B><I>nonprinting characters</I></B>. Nonprinting characters are characters that will not be printed in your final document. 
<BR>Nonprinting characters include spaces, tabs, and paragraph marks. 
<BR>
<BR>You can easily show or hide the nonprinting characters with the following button: <B>Show/Hide</B> Paragraph button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/para.gif">) located in the Standard toolbar. The <B>Show/Hide</B> Paragraph button displays or undisplays the nonprinting characters when it is clicked. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Click on the <IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/para.gif">, to display nonprinting characters. 
<BR>
<BR>Your screen should look as follows: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc2.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR>Now that your screen is set up, it is time to create a letter. The letter you will be creating will look as follows: 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc8.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR>When Word starts, it contains a blank document ready for new text. The cursor, a flashing vertical bar, is in the upper-left corner of the <B><I>work area</I></B>, the area where text is entered and modified. 
<BR>
<BR>Before you actually type your letter it is a good idea to become familiar with Word's on screen help program. </FONT><CENTER><H2>Getting On-Screen Help </H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Word provides on-screen help program called <B><I>Word Help.</I></B> Word Help provides information about an operation in progress, or information about any topic you may have.</FONT><CENTER><H2>How To Obtain Information About An Operation in Progress </H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>

<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>The Help Button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/help1.gif">) located under the <B>Help</B> menu allows you to view information about a command, window, or button on the screen. To do this, you click the Help Button first. The pointer changes to an arrow with a question mark. You then position the pointer on the item you want information about and click again. 
<BR>
<BR>Let's use the Help Button to obtain information about the Print Button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/help2.gif">).

<BR>
<BR>If you make a typing error, erase it using the delete key. 
<BR>
<BR>It is now time to learn how to make minor corrections to your document. 
<BR>
<BR>You can make corrections using: 
<BR></FONT>

<LI><FONT size=3>Word's Undo and Redo features. </FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>The Delete Key</B> 
<BR>You simply position the insertion point immediately before the character you want to change and press the delete key. This will delete the character and you can now retype. 
<BR>
<BR><!-- Word's Undo and Redo Features -----------------><B>Word's Undo and Redo Features</B> 
<BR>You can usually undo or redo the last several operations you have performed using the following buttons located on the standard toolbar: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word3.gif"> 
<BR>
<BR>The <B>Undo</B> command allows you to cancel the last several commands you performed in a document. The <B>Redo</B> command allows you to perform the same option again. 
<BR>
<BR>Now that you know how to correct errors, it is time to enter the remaining text of the letter. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key twice. Type in today's date. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe that each time you pressed the return key a new line (paragraph) started. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key twice. Type in your first name and last name. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key once. Type in your street address. On the next line, the city, state, and zip code. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key twice to leave a blank line between the zip code and what you are about to type. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Type in 'Dear' followed by 'Mr.' or 'Ms.' and your last name plus a colon.

<BR>
<BR>Entering text in Word is like typing on a typewriter except for one exception. Word has <B><I>word wraparound</I></B>. Word wraparound automatically starts a new line when you reach the right margin of your document. This means that you don't need to press the Return key at the end of each line. You use the Return key only to start a new paragraph or to skip a line. 
<BR>
<BR>You will type in the remaining text (displayed below), pressing the return key only at the end of each paragraph or to leave a blank line. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Type in the remaining text:

<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Whenever you want to format something in Word, the general rule is "select, and then do". 
<BR>For example, you may want to make a block of text bold. You must select the block of text first then make it bold. 
<BR>
<BR>You can select text by click and dragging with the mouse. As you drag the mouse over the text you want, it becomes highlighted. Release the mouse button to select the highlighted text. 
<BR>To cancel a text selection, you can simply click once or press one of the arrow keys.

<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>You can select a line of text by using the selection bar just to the left of the date in your document. 
<BR>You know that you are within the selection bar if the shape of the pointer changes into an arrow. 
<BR>
<BR>To select a line, you simply move the pointer into the selection bar before the line you want to select and click. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the line of text starting with the word 'Please', by using the selection bar.</FONT><CENTER><H2>Deleting Text</H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Once you have selected text, one of the things you can do with that text is delete it. You can delete text permanently, or you can remove it from your document and place it on the clipboard, for temporary storage. 
<BR>
<BR>To delete text permanently, select it and then hit the delete key. 
<BR>
<BR>To undo a deletion you can click on the Undo button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word10.gif">) located in the Standard toolbar.

<P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>There are two ways that you can move text. The first way to move text, is done by placing it on the clipboard and then paste it where you want to. 
<BR>The second way to move selected text is by dragging it from one spot and dropping it in another using the mouse. This operation is called <B><I>drag and drop</I></B>. 
<BR>
<BR>Let's move the line of text starting with your first name. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the line of text starting with the your first name. 
<BR>Click on the <B>Cut</B> button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word11.gif">) located in the Standard toolbar. 
<BR>The text has been removed from your document, but a copy of it is temporarily stored in the clipboard. Let's paste it below the last line in your document. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position the insertion point below the last line in your document. 
<BR>Choose <B>Paste</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu or click on the <B>Paste</B> button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word13.gif">) located in the standard toolbar. 
<BR>
<BR>The text should appear below the last line in your document. 
<BR>You will now move the line of text back to where it came from. Move the line of text by dragging and dropping. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the line of text starting with your first name. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position the pointer somewhere within the selection to change the shape of the pointer to an arrow. Press and hold down the mouse button to "grab" the selected line of text. 
<BR>Note that the pointer should have a small dotted vertical line attached to it, which signifies the block of text you are moving. There should also be a rectangle attached to the pointer. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Continuing to hold down the right mouse button, move the pointer so the dotted insertion point is positioned somewhere else in your document.

<BR>The line of text starting with your first name should be back where it started.</FONT><CENTER><H2>Copying Text</H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Copying text is very much like moving text. The only difference is that the selected text is not deleted when a copy of it is inserted elsewhere in your document. 
<BR>
<BR>You can copy selected text by choosing <B>Copy</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu or clicking on the <B>Copy</B> button (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word15.gif">) located in the Standard toolbar. 
<BR>
<BR>You can also copy selected text by dragging and dropping. You need to hold down both the control key and the mouse button while you are dragging. 
<BR>
<BR>Now that you are comfortable with selecting, moving, copying and deleting text, it is time to format your document. 
<BR>
<BR>The letters in the document are a bit small. Let's make the letters larger. That is you will change the font size (type size) of your letters.</FONT><CENTER><H2>Changing Typeface and Type Size</H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Word offers a wide variety of type styles (fonts) for you to use. You can use fonts for emphasis or to provide variation in your document. 
<BR>The type size of a particular font is related to the printer. Printers measure type size in <I>points</I>. A point is 1/72 of an inch, so 72-pointt type is 1 inch high. Most books are printed using 9- to 11-point type size. Word is capable of producing type sizes from 4 point to 127 points in 1/2 increments. Whether that full range of sizes is actually available to you will depend on the font you are using and on the printer. 
<BR>
<BR>There are two ways to change the font and font size. 
<BR>If you are familiar with the different fonts and font sizes, you need only select the text and work with the <B>Font</B> box and <B>Font Size</B> box located in the Formatting toolbar. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe the <B>Font</B> and <B>Font Size</B> boxes: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word21.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR>If you want to preview the font and font size that you are considering it is best to choose <B>Font</B> from the <B>Format</B> menu. When you choose <B>Font</B> from the <B>Format</B> menu a Font dialog box will appear and this is where you can experiment. 
<BR>
<BR>In the tutorial we will change the font and font size using the Font dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>To change the font size of the entire document, you must select it first. 
<BR>
<BR>To select the document: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Select All</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu. 
<BR>
<BR>Your document should look similar to the following:

<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Font</B> from the <B>Format</B> menu to open the Font dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>The following Font dialog box should appear:

<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Highlight Bold in the Font Style box. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe that you could have also made the text 'Supercorporation' bold by selecting it and then pressing on the <IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc9.gif"> button located in the Formatting toolbar. 
<BR>
<BR>Now that you know how to change fontsize and style, it is time to learn how to format paragraphs. 
<BR>
<BR>Word offers paragraph formatting options. You will use paragraph formatting to make the different sections stand out more clearly. One of the most basic paragraph formats is line alignment. Word can create four kinds of paragraph line alignment: 
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Aligned left 
<LI>Centered alignment 
<LI>Aligned right 
<LI>Justified alignment 
</UL>
<P>
<BR>The letter that you are creating is currently aligned left, the default line alignment in Word.<CENTER><H2>Paragraph Line Alignment</H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>You can align a paragraph by using the Formatting toolbar or using the Paragraph dialog box. Remember the general rule is to select what you want to format, then do. 
<BR>
<BR>In this tutorial we will align paragraphs using the Paragraph dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>To center a paragraph using the Paragraph dialog box: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the text 'Supercorporation'. 
<BR>We want to center this paragraph. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Paragraph</B> from the <B>Format</B> menu to open the Paragraph dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>The following Paragraph dialog box should appear: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc10.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the <B>Indents and Spacing</B> tab if it is not already on top. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the <B>Alignment</B> drop-down list box so the four alignment options are revealed. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the <B>Centered</B> option. 
<BR>Note the bold paragraph in the Preview box is centered. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Click on the <B>OK</B> button. 
<BR>The text 'Supercorporation' should be centered. 
<BR>
<BR>The Paragraph dialog box gives you access to nearly all of the paragraph formats available to you. The more common paragraph formatting options are located in the Formatting toolbar for your convenience. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe the following paragraph formatting buttons: 
<BR><CENTER><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word25.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>To align paragraphs using the paragraph formatting buttons, you simply select the paragraph you want to align and then click on the appropriate button. 
<BR>
<BR>Now that you know how to align paragraphs it is time to learn how to indent paragraphs.<CENTER><H2>Indenting Paragraphs </H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>Word allows you to indent a paragraph from the left and right margins and to indent the first line independently on the left. You can also leave the the first line unindented and indent the subsequent lines in the paragraph, which is called a <I><B>hanging indentation</B></I>. 
<BR>
<BR>You can use the mouse to set indentations on Word's ruler. 
<BR>To make the ruler visible on the screen: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Ruler</B> from the <B>View</B> menu. 
<BR>
<BR>The following ruler should be on your screen: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word26.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR>The three triangular<B> <I>ident markers</I></B> denoted in the image above, are used to set indentations. 
<BR>You can "grab" each indent marker with the mouse pointer and slide the marker to the left or right to adjust the indentation. To "grab" a marker, position the pointer over it and then click and hold down the mouse button, the marker will move with the pointer. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> "Grab" an indent marker and move it around. 
<BR>
<BR>Note that if you grab the small box beneath the top and bottom left indent marker and move it, they will move together. 
<BR>Be sure to position your pointer carefully when you want to move an indent marker. 
<BR>When you are done experimenting, put the markers back where they were. 
<BR>
<BR>The top left indent marker (First-line indent marker) sets the amount of indentation for the first line. 
<BR>
<BR>The bottom left indent marker (Left-edge indent marker) sets the amount of indentation for the remaining lines in the paragraph. 
<BR>
<BR>The indent marker at the right (Right-edge indent marker) sets the amount of indentation from the right edge. 
<BR>
<BR>We will use the top left indent marker to indent the first line of the paragraph starting with the text 'It is my pleasure...'. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position the insertion point somewhere within the text of the paragraph starting with the text 'It is my pleasure...'. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position the pointer on the First-line indent marker (the top left triangle). 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press and hold down the mouse button to grab the indent marker. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Move the indent marker to the right so it is positioned under the .5 inch mark on the ruler. 
<BR>
<BR>The line of text should now be indented .5 inches. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Indent the first line of the paragraph starting with the text 'Please consider...' .5 inches. 
<BR>
<BR>Your document should look similar to the following: 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc11.jpg"><H2 align=center>Understanding Paragraph Formatting</H2><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>Every time you format something in Word that information is stored. The formatting information for a paragraph is stored in the paragraph mark (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word28.gif">) at the end of the paragraph. 
<BR>If you delete the paragraph mark, the formatting information is also deleted. The paragraph will take on the formatting information of the paragraph it is joined with. 
<BR>On the other hand, if the insertion point is inside a paragraph and you press the Return key to begin a new paragraph, the new paragraph takes on the formatting of the previous one. 
<BR>
<BR>Since Word has this feature, you will need to get comfortable with copying existing paragraph formats. 
<BR>For example, you can create an additional centered paragraph in your letter using the name and address paragraph. Let's try it. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position the insertion point at the end of the text 'Supercorporation' in your document. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the Return key to begin a new paragraph. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Type some text. Note that the text is centered. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Delete the text and new paragraph you just added. 
<BR>
<BR>Here is a great tip that can help you out in the future: 
<BR>If you want a quick look at font and paragraph formats, select the Help button at the right end of the Standard toolbar. The pointer will change into an arrow with a question mark attached to it. Then click anywhere in the text to get a listing of formatting information. When you are done reading the formatting information, press the escape key on the keyboard. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Take a look at the different types of font and paragraph formats by using the Help button and clicking anywhere in text. 
<BR>
<BR>Now that you are familiar with paragraph formatting, it is time to learn how to set tab stops.<CENTER><H2>Tab Stops </H2></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>A tab is a marker that you define to allow you to move quickly to a specific position in a document. Tabs are used to align text at a location measured from the left margin of a document. 
<BR>
<BR>You can see the tabs set every half-inch along the ruler, indicated by small dots at the bottom edge of the ruler. 
<BR>
<BR>You can put custom tabs on the ruler by clicking along the ruler's bottom edge under the measure ment marks. Four kinds of tabs can be set from the ruler. The four kind of tabs are located in the <B><I>Tab Alignment box</I></B> located on the Formatting toolbar. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word32.gif"> 
<BR>
<BR>If you click on the Tab Alignment button you will notice that there are four different styles of tag stops: left, center, right, and decimal. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word33.gif"> The <B>Left tab</B> will align text along the left edge of the tab stop. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word34.gif"> The <B>Center tab</B> will center lines at the tab stop. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word35.gif"> The <B>Right tab</B> will align text along the right edge of the tab stop. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word36.gif"> The <B>Decimal tab</B> will align text or more commonly numbers on the decimal point under the tab stop. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Locate the Tab Alignment button and click on it to see the four style of tab stops mentioned above. 
<BR>
<BR>You can also set tabs using the Tab dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>In this tutorial we will focus on using the Tabs dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>We would like to set a tab for the corporations address, which has not been typed in yet. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position your insertion mark one line above the date. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Type: Supercorporation 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key once. Type: 5 Industrial Lane 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key once. Type: Perry, N.Y. 55555 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Press the return key three times. 
<BR>
<BR>Your document should look similar to the following: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc12.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR>Now we would like to move this address to the 4.5 inch mark on the ruler. To do this, we will set a tab there. 
<BR>Remember to format a section of text, you must select it first then format. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the text 'Supercorporation' and it's address. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc13.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Choose <B>Tab</B> from the <B>Format</B> menu to open the Tab dialog box. 
<BR>
<BR>The following Tab dialog box should appear: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc14.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Type in 4.5 in the Tab Stop Position box. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select Left in the Alignment box. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select 1 None in the Leader box. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Click on the <B>Set</B> button and then click the <B>OK</B> button. 
<BR>
<BR>You have just set a tab stop for that selected text only. If you position your insertion point in the text 'Supercorporation' and it's address and press the tab key, the text will jump to the 4.5 inch mark. 
<BR>
<BR>If you are anywhere outside the name of the company and it's address and press the tab key you will not necessarily jump to the 4.5 inch mark. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position your insertion point inside the text 'Supercorporation' and press the tab key. 
<BR>
<BR>The text 'Supercorporation' should jump to the 4.5 inch mark. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position your insertion mark inside the remaining two lines of the address and press the tab key. 
<BR>
<BR>Your document should look similar to the following: 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc15.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR>Notice that the corporation's address is a bit too far to the right. The tab that has been set is too far to the right. The tab should really be at 4.1. 
<BR>
<BR>You could reset the tab using the procedure above, but let's try using the ruler instead. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the text 'Supercorporation'. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe the left tab (<IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/word33.gif">) located at the 4.5 inch mark on the ruler. 
<BR>
<BR>Position your mouse on the left tab and move the tab over to the 4.1 inch mark on the ruler. 
<BR>
<BR>The text 'Supercorporation' should now be positioned at the 4.1 inch mark. 
<BR>
<BR>Observe: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc16.jpg"> 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the second line of text that makes up the address and move the left tab to the 4.1 inch mark on the ruler. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Select the last line of text that makes up the address and move the left tab to the 4.1 inch mark on the ruler. 
<BR>
<BR>Lastly, the bold face heading <B>Supercorporation</B> is too close to the address. 
<BR>
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Position the insertion point after the heading and press the return key twice to enter two blank lines. 
<BR>
<BR>You have now finished your document. 
<BR>
<BR>Your document should look similar to the following: 
<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/doc17.jpg">
<BR>(Sorry, but the last two lines didn't fit. Go back to the last section if you need to view the last two lines.)
