<BR>The first page is missing a title. The colorful border is an imported graphic. If you try to type on top of it, nothing will appear.

<BR><IMG src="http://einstein.cs.uri.edu/tutorials/csc101/pc/word97/images/dothistr.gif"> Try to type some text within the colorful border. 
<BR>
<BR>What you want to do is add text to a graphic. In order to add text to a graphic you will insert a <I><B>text box</I></FONT></B><FONT size=3>. Text boxes are used to position text or an inserted picture on a page. Text boxes are also used to place text or a graphic behind or in front of the main text. Text boxes do not automatically resize when you add text or graphics. A graphic added to a text box resizes itself to fit the text box, and if you type more text than the text box will hold you must resize the box to make the text visible. 
<BR>
<BR>Text that you type in a text box is formatted with the Normal style unless you specify otherwise. You can format text in a text box by selecting the text first.</FONT>
