<H2><CENTER>What is Word?</CENTER></H2><HR SIZE=4>
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Word 97</B> is a full-featured word processing application. The basic capabilities of a word processor are typing, editing, and formatting. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Typing</B> 
<BR>Generally, to create a document, you simply type. The words you type are stored in the memory of the computer, and when you save your work, a copy of those words are stored on your disk. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Editing</B> 
<BR>The ability to easily edit, or change, the text you've typed is what makes word processing far more powerful than typing on a typewriter. Using a word processing application's editing functions, you can quickly move and change the words electronically without having to retype the entire document. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Formatting</B> 
<BR>Another job that word processing applications handle well is formatting the text you've typed. When you format a document, you determine what the document will look like when it is finally printed. Formatting involves setting margins, tabs, indentation, and other similar attributes of your document. 
<BR>
<BR>To make this kind of formatting easier, the trend has been toward "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG, pronounced "wizzywig") word processors, where the document appears on the screen of the computer exactly as it will appear when printed. Word 97 is a WYSIWYG word processing application. 
<BR>
<BR>In addition to the basic word processing capabilities, Word 97 has a number of advanced features. These features include: 
<BR>
<BR><B>Advanced Formatting</B> 
<BR><B>Word's </B>advanced formatting features allow for multiple column documents and other special formats, such as graphics that are surrounded by text, tables that have borders around them, and so on. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Automatic Footnoting</B> 
<BR>Word 97 automatically numbers your footnotes and makes room for them at the bottom of the page or at the end of a section. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Print Merging</B> 
<BR>Using Word's Print Merge function, you can print customized versions of form documents, such as personal form letters. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Wizards</B> 
<BR>Word has many wizards to help you get your work done. These features make repititive, time-consuming, or difficult tasks easy. For example, the tasks involved in setting up a standard letter or a fax cover sheet can be handled entirely by a wizard. You simply follow on-screen directions to define a document's layout. 
<BR>
<BR><B>"Auto" features</B> 
<BR>Word performs a number of procedures for you automatically as you type. For example, Word's AutoCorrect feature will automatically replace "teh" with "the" and "ast he" with "as the" and make sure that your sentences begin with an uppercase letter. 
<BR>
<BR><B>The Office Assistant</B> 
<BR>When you have a question about how to accomplish a task in "Word" you can "talk" to the Office Assistant using typed English phrases. The Office Assistant analyzes your request and provides a resource list of potential help topics. The Assistant can also provide step-by-step instructions on how to complete a task and even perform certain tasts for you. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Proofing Tools</B> 
<BR>Word 97 offers an integrated spell- and grammar-checking capability. When you request a Spelling and Grammar check, Word compares each word in your document to the words stored in a standard dictionary. If no match is found, the <B>spelling checker</B> typically marks the word and suggests alternative spellings or other words. Word also analyzes your document's punctuation, sentence structure, and word usage. Another writing tool in Word is the electronic thesaurus. A <B>thesaurus</B> provides a list of synonyms (and antonyms) for a given word or phrase.
