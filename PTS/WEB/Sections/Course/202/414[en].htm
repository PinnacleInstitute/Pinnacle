<H1>Introduction to Mastery!</H1><H4>Mastery sounds so formidable - is it truly open to all?</H4><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P align=justify>Part of the conditioning that we receive when we enter this world, and grow in knowledge and stature,&nbsp;is that we are not perfect, and that we cannot attain perfection.&nbsp; I'm only human! is a cry that you hear often.&nbsp; Jesus the Christ knew and taught that perfection is possible.&nbsp; Matthew 5:48 records him saying (from the sermon on the mount)&nbsp;"Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect".&nbsp; Personal Mastery is your attainment of perfection, or rather, your coming to realisation that you <U>are</U> perfect.&nbsp; It may seem&nbsp;strange to you that you are already perfect, when your senses and logic tell you otherwise.&nbsp; And so we enter into the ongoing debate between you, the ego, and You, the higher self. 
<P align=justify>If what you have just read is new to you, then that also is okay!&nbsp; You will be able to catch up quickly, but you may need to suspend your disbelief for a moment or two.&nbsp; The essence of the understanding of who you are comes down to this.&nbsp; Lower-case you is your ego that is closely associated with your body.&nbsp; Higher case You is your higher self, sometimes referred to as the soul, that is closely associated with the divine, God, Goddess, or Holy Spirit, depending on the belief structure you were born into.&nbsp; There is a power struggle going on inside you now.&nbsp; This struggle is between you and You.&nbsp; Some of this will make more sense as you progress through the lessons in this course, and have the opportunity to achieve Mastery of the various aspects of your life.&nbsp; Oh, and yes, Mastery is truly open to all, but,&nbsp; "All are called, Few choose to Listen".&nbsp; If you have come this far, then Mastery is within your reach!</BLOCKQUOTE><H4 align=justify>So, am I perfect?</H4><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P align=justify>Yes, You are perfect, and no, you are not perfect!&nbsp; The perfection that You have is the perfection that is your higher self or soul.&nbsp; The imperfection that you have is the illusion that your ego protects.&nbsp; Claiming your birth-right as a perfect human being is both easy and difficult.&nbsp; It is as easy as acknowledging that You are perfect, and as difficult as overcoming the lies and illusions of you the ego.&nbsp; Take courage then, as you tred your path.&nbsp; Do not be afraid!&nbsp; Fear always lies!&nbsp; You will be rewarded for your efforts towards personal Mastery.</BLOCKQUOTE><H4 align=justify>But, doesn't Mastery take years and years of effort?</H4><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P align=justify>Ah! this is very interesting!&nbsp; If you read the lives of the Saints, or the spiritual leaders of the East, you will see that they all took years to walk the path to Mastery.&nbsp; Some of my own favourite Saints (like St Francis of Assisi) spent years and years becoming personal Masters.&nbsp; But time is speeding up, and what once took years can now be achieved in months, or even weeks.&nbsp; The reasons that time is speeding up are to do with what is happening to the earth at present.&nbsp; Some of the background to this can be found in Quantum Physics.&nbsp; That is to say that Quantum Physics can explain in scientific terms events and occurances that you used to (and may still) call supernormal.&nbsp; You will find this treated more fully in the next lesson of this course.&nbsp; In the meantime, to gain an understanding of the true nature of reality, we would recommend you read "The Holographic Universe".&nbsp; And lest you think that this book is dated, please also refer to the article in Scientific American, August 2003, "Information in the Holographic Universe" by Jacob D. Bekenstein.</BLOCKQUOTE><H4 align=justify>Additional reading for this lesson</H4><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
