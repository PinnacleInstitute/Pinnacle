<B><FONT size=4>Designing For Success</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>When inexperienced designers start a Web site design, they typically begin by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>laying out the major functional blocks of the home page or by doing a color and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>graphic layout.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But designing a site is just the same as building a house. You have to <B>start with</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>the foundation </B>and work up.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If the foundation isn't solid, it will need reinforcement work later on. If the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>foundation isn't the right shape, then the final form of the house will not be what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you need. Trying to fix a foundation after it has a house built on top of it is an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive and time-consuming process.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A Web site is the same way. The functions of a site will drive its final form. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to define the requirements as completely as possible <B>before </B>you start the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site layout.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Why? Because if you don’t, you may have to throw away what you have done</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and start over.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Not defining the requirements early can easily double the amount of work you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to do. Unfortunately, you don't get to increase your price to compensate for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this. After all, it’s not the client's fault that you didn’t collect all of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>requirements before you began.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>There are certain steps to follow whenever you design a Web site. It doesn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>matter how big or how small the site is, the steps are always the same. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>professionals design this way and so should you -  after all, you are a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>professional designer now.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>First, the big picture…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Define the purpose of the site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Identify your client’s target market</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Conduct a competition survey</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Define the features of the site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) </B>Identify keywords</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) </B>Develop the wire frame</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) </B>Create the storyboard</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) </B>Build the prototype</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) </B>Complete the final design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now, a closer look at each step…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #1 </B>-  Define the <B>purpose </B>of the site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Just like a business, a Web site needs clearly stated goals. Without clear goals,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the site will be much more difficult to design. The design will lack direction and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the Web site will never quite meet the user’s needs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The site goals should just pop right out of your initial client interview, but often</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they will not be so apparent. Your client may not have well-defined objectives</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and may not even realize that they are required. It is also possible that s/he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expects so much from the site that dozens of goals are presented.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When this happens, you will have to work with the client to define the real goals</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the site. Discuss each one but keep narrowing down the choices as you go</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>along.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Ken Evoy, well-respected Internet marketing author/guru and President of</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>SiteSell.com </B><B>(http://www.sitesell.com/) </B>coined the phrase “<B>MWR </B>(<B>M</B>ost</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>W</B>anted <B>R</B>esponse).” It’s an excellent term to use when you are helping a client</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>pinpoint the purpose of his or her site.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t get trapped into goals that you cannot achieve or cannot control. A goal to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell 637 books a day is not realistic. You can design a site to sell books, but you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can’t control how many it sells. There are too many factors involved -  you don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have absolute control over the site’s Search Engine ranking, the size of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>market, or the popularity of the book.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s acceptable to have more than one goal, but if you attempt too many things,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the site will not accomplish anything well.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Here are a few examples of goal statements…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>The primary objective of this site is to promote and sell Mr. Smith’s new book.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>The site will provide a direct sales outlet for the book, and it will also promote</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>seminars associated with this book.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>The goal of the site is to create an online scholarly journal to promote the study</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>of natural history.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>The Web site will be designed to encourage potential clients to contact the</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>company about contracting Web site design services.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(Did you recognize the last one? It could be a possible goal statement for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>designer’s site.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once you have a clear goal for the site, everything else in the design should work</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>towards achieving that goal.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #2 </B>Identify your client’s target market.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After you figure out the goals of the site, you have to determine its audience.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The best way to do this is by developing a “Customer Profile.” You and your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>client need to define as many specific customer characteristics as possible.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is where your marketing skills come into play -  especially, your knowledge</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about niche marketing and market segments. You don’t have to be an expert but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you do need to share what you know. Your client may or may not (the latter is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the usual situation) have any experience with this.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Work with your client to figure out exactly who is going to visit his site and buy his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products and services. How will they use the site? How do they shop? How will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they buy?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Knowing who is going to visit and how they will use the site will shape the design.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #3 </B>Conduct a competition survey.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Search the Internet for similar sites to see what your client’s competitors are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>doing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Check out the features and content of their sites. You are certainly not going to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>copy their sites, but you don’t want to overlook anything that might leave your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>client at a competitive disadvantage. You can also get a good feel for the needs</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the target market by reviewing these sites.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size=4><B>(SIDEBAR!)</B></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>You can do this manually via your favorite Search Engine tool, or you can use</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>Site Build It! </B><B>(http://buildit.sitesell.com/ </B>). Its super-brainstorming tool will</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>automatically provide the URLs of the most popular sites for hundreds of</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>keywords/topics related to your client’s business theme.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #4 </B>Define the features of the site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The features of the site can best be described as those things that add</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>functionality and utility. These include the client’s requests, the features that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>found during your Internet searches, and those items that you know need to be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>there (based on your expertise as a designer.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your features list might look something like this…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>2" x 3" product photos (16)</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>4" x 6" product photos (16)</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>Flash animation of product #1</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>• </B>Contact Us form</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The purpose of this step is to make sure that you have identified anything and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everything that may drive the design of the site. You don’t want to find yourself</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>trying to squeeze something in later on in the process.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #5 </B>Identify the best keywords.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Discuss and create a list of keywords that the client believes his target market</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would use to find his business. There are also several keyword search tools</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>available online that can help you supplement the list.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(I like <B>SBI!’s </B>brainstorming tool because it quickly identifies a list of related</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>keywords/keyword phrases along with a profitability ratio. You can see at a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>glance, which keywords are the best choices to build theme-related pages</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>around. The brainstorming software is also part of a complete all-in-one</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>package, so it comes at no extra cost.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #6 </B>Develop the wire frame.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Developing a <B>wire frame </B>is an essential step. You start integrating the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information you have into a Web site. The wire frame is a tool that lets you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>organize and reorganize the site information quickly and easily. It makes it easy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to spot any inconsistencies and omissions and it lets you view the entire Web site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on one piece of paper.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Start by making a site map (list of all pages). Under each page name, list the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>features that you will put on that page, as well as any subordinate pages. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>should include comments, ideas, and as much detail as you like in your wire</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>frame. In fact, the more detail you include, the easier the next step will be.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wire framing forces you to examine the site <B>page by page and function by</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>function.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s important to carefully consider the <B>role </B>of the site’s content pages. Highvalue</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relevant content pages are the key ingredients for building traffic. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reality is often the most overlooked and forgotten part of site development,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>especially with an e-commerce site. Don’t fall into the same trap.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You should expect to make several versions of the wire frame before you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>satisfied. Every time you update the wire frame, review it from the visitor's</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>viewpoint, from the client's, and from your own as the designer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>OK, back to the present task at hand… imagine that you are a visitor and walk</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>through the site…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Can you find the information you need? Can you select a product, add it to your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shopping cart, and place the order? If not, go back and revise it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Secondly, examine it from the client’s perspective…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Does it include everything that was discussed in the interviews? Does it have all</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the critical features that the competition has in their sites? If not, go back and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>revise it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Finally, look at it from a designer’s viewpoint…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you see anything there that will drive the design? Is the structure so complex</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that it will be difficult to create a navigation scheme? Is there room for growth?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Does the shopping cart that you want to use blend well with this structure, or will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you need to change the wire frame because you are locked into a specific layout</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by the cart?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Invite others to look at the wire frame. Ask them to walk through it as a visitor</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The more people you get, the more likely you are to find potential problems. But</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>select them carefully. You don’t want reviewers who will stay quiet rather than</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>risk hurting your feelings. Choose people who will really help.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Go through the wire frame as many times as required to get it perfect. Add as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much detail as you want so that you don’t miss anything. Remember, if you miss</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anything now, you will have to add it later, and the impact can be significant.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Submit the completed wire frame to the client for review. By doing this, you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>saying, “These are the requirements for the Web site as I understand them.” You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want the client to agree to them before you continue.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #7 </B>Create the storyboard.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You are getting dangerously close to starting the layout, but you are not there</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yet. There is one more step -  “storyboarding.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you know how cartoons are developed? After the story and the dialog are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>written, but before the animation starts, the animators go through a process</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>called storyboarding. In this step, simple sketches of key scenes in the cartoon</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are drawn and tacked to a wall in a meeting room. This allows everyone working</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the project to develop a common baseline. It also defines critical features of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>each scene.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You are going to use this basic storyboarding concept, but you are going to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>modify it a little. Your storyboard pages will not contain any graphics. Instead,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>each page in the storyboard will contain everything you know about each page in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Every page in the wire frame will get its own storyboard page. These pages will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>define all of the functions, features, and content of the corresponding Web site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pages. This means more than just rewriting the information found in the wire</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>frame.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The storyboard is where you write the text for the page and insert the copy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provided by the client. Develop keyword-focused, high-value, Search-Engine-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Optimized content pages that will please both visitor and Search Engine alike. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you don’t, the site will not deliver traffic or sales (i.e., results). And that means a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dissatisfied client and no chance at repeat contracts or positive word-of-mouth</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>referrals.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After you complete individual pages, you can organize them into a final</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>storyboard that displays each page’s position in the whole package. Doing this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will help you to visualize the site and to see any problems in the relationships</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>between the pages.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #8 </B>Build the prototype.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Up to this point, you have been defining the requirements and contents of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site. Now you can start developing the layout. (Finally!) In this step, you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>develop some nonfunctioning Web pages -  demo pages for the client to review.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Open your favorite graphics package and start developing your layout visually.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Identify a section for the page header, for the menu, for the footer, and for all of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the features of the site. Go through your storyboard sheets and make sure that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>every page can be comfortably mapped into the proposed layout. If something</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>isn’t right, change the layout or revise the storyboard until everything fits</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>together.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once you have a rough layout, start the detailed graphic design. Pick the colors</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for the site based on client preferences, site themes, the target market, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products or services, or your personal preferences. Select your navigation</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>scheme and draw the menu links on the page. Add a header and footer if they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are part of your design. Continue to work on the layout until you are satisfied that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it meets all of the requirements. If there are several distinct types of pages</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(content pages, product pages, etc.) then create layouts for each page type.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Stop here and send an e-mail to the client. Attach the graphic images and ask</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for feedback. If the client doesn’t like the layout, color scheme, etc., now is the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time to find out. Ask the client to define comments as clearly as possible. It may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>take an additional revision or two, but if everything was defined up front, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>approval cycle should go smoothly.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>STEP #9 </B>Complete the final design.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Congratulations! You are almost finished. You have the requirements, the page</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contents, the layout, and client approval. It’s time to do the detailed page layout.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Open your HTML editor and your graphics software and design a page template</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that matches the graphic version that your client approved. Include a functioning</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>menu, define the font sizes, set up the links, and create areas where you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>insert content. Save your design as a template so that you can just cut and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>paste all of the contents in place. If there are different page layouts, make a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>template for each type.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>At this point, it is just a matter of integrating everything into the final product.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This isn’t to say that this is a trivial step. The actual building process is still a lot</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of work, but you will have everything you need at your fingertips. You can now</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>build the complete site, put it online and test it to verify that everything works.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>The designing process, outlined in the nine steps above, works very well. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>follow it, your life as a designer will be much, much easier.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Please note that the process was developed for larger design shops. In these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shops, the client calls and talks to a sales representative who addresses cost,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contracts, etc. Once the contract is signed, the account passes to a design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>supervisor who manages the design and assigns it to a member of the design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>staff. When different people share responsibilities, it is essential that everything</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be well defined every step of the way or something may be overlooked.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In your one-person business, you will probably find yourself combining steps,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>especially when you are developing small Web sites. Let me emphasize</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>something, though… I said <B>‘combining steps,’ </B>not ‘skipping steps.’</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you develop the site map, you can also start collecting keywords, goals,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and site features. You could also create the original site map as a wire frame.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is nothing wrong with that. The essential idea is to see that you have all of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the requirements defined before you move from one stage to the next.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is also one other consideration…</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>The design process has been laid out step by step. In reality, design is a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>repetitive process and all of the steps are interrelated. You may need to do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some of the steps out of order, revise previous steps based on the results of later</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>steps, or combine steps.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The size of the job will also affect your design process. Larger jobs will drive you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to follow the steps more closely and to document them. On smaller jobs, you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>combine steps and do some of them in your head rather than on paper. Your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>design technique will be a reflection of your skills, training, and personality. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will find that as you gain experience, you will tailor the procedure to fit the way</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you work.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>It all boils down to this…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are going to build a successful Web site design business, you need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know how to design successful Web sites -  sites that produce income for your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clients.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That’s the bottom line outcome your clients want and need. And, if you meet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their needs, they will help you build your business by repeat contracts and wordof-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mouth referrals.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Always keep in mind that you are not just designing Web sites. You are building</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>your business </B>by developing marketing tools for your clients.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>There are many site development resources available. Some you can buy in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bookstores. Others you can buy online. But most of these only give you little</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pieces of the puzzle.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They teach you about usability, or they tell you about copywriting. But they don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tie everything together. And very few of these resources tell you how to use Web</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sites as Internet marketing tools. They don’t really give you what you need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make your Webmaster business soar.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is, however, one small business source that ties marketing and design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information together superbly…</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>Since there is only enough time and space to highlight one of the above, let’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>focus on <B>Site Build It!.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are several “do it yourself” Web site tools on the market. For the most</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>part, they are tools for amateurs. These tools boast about how easy they are to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>use and how beautiful their templates are, but few (if any) address the “business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>side” of site design.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They don’t consider Search Engine ranking. They don’t address the importance</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of customer-oriented copywriting. The simplest ones just let you get “something”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>online. Even the more complex ones don’t do much more than that. In short,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most of these tools make no concerted attempt to build high trafficked salesgenerating</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web sites.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>
