<B><FONT size=4>Dealing With Clients</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>One of the most interesting things about running a business is the people you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>meet. Or in the case of an Internet-based business, the people you won’t meet.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once your business site is online, it will attract clients from all over the country</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and from all over the world. As a result, many of your clients will only be voices</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the phone. Some you will know only through e-mail.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This can create some unique situations for you. Communication is hard enough</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>when you meet face to face. When you add the complications of distance, voice</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>only (phone), or text only (e-mail), it can become very difficult.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s important to learn how to communicate and to develop close working</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relationships with your clients despite these barriers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The best way to keep clients happy is to keep them informed. Answer their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions and keep them updated on the status of their new Web sites. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>could take a lot of your time, but it is an essential part of the job.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The key is to communicate with your client frequently. The two of you have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>define the Web site in words before you can start coding Web pages. You also</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to document any agreements or understandings that you make.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s look at the different forms of contact…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) Telephone</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The telephone is the fastest and most efficient means to communicate with your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clients. On the phone, you can ask questions, discuss issues, and reach</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agreements. If there is any misunderstanding or confusion, it can be cleared up</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>very quickly and at a relatively inexpensive cost.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unfortunately, phone calls don’t leave written records. So, after you complete a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>phone call where decisions and agreements were reached, document it with a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>follow-up e-mail. This will provide both you and your client with written</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>confirmation of the discussions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This follow up is a critical management step. It provides both you and your client</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with documentation of the design (and changes to the design). You can check</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with the records as you progress through the process in order to make sure that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you haven't missed any details. They also can be used to justify charging for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>work that was beyond that required by the initial contract.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) E-mail</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you meet with someone in person, what you say is balanced by the tone of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your voice, facial expressions, and eye contact. When you speak on the phone,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the visual cues are gone, but your voice is still rich with tone and inflections.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>None of these are present in e-mail. So be very careful. It is very easy to offend</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with e-mail. Jokes <B>will </B>be misinterpreted. Casual comments <B>will </B>be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>misunderstood. Keep your e-mails professional. Use them as a vehicle to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>communicate ideas and as a means to document site requirements.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whenever you send an e-mail to a client, send a copy to yourself as well. Keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>these copies in a folder with any messages that you receive from a client.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These will provide both you and your client with a written record of discussions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and agreements for future reference.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>3) In Person</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Face-to-face conversations have the advantage that you can express ideas</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>freely and quickly with little chance of misunderstanding. If there is ever any</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>confusion, you can pull out a piece of paper and clarify things with a sketch. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you have the option, always deal with your clients in person.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Similar to phone conversations, there is no concrete documentation of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>conclusions or agreements. Be sure to follow up every meeting with a written</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>summary and send it to your client (and yourself) by e-mail.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>From types of contact to types of clients…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>People come in different sizes, shapes, and temperaments. Sizes and shapes</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have no effect on your relationships with your clients, but temperaments can be a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>major issue.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You will find that your clients fall into three categories…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Nice</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Non-responsive</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Demanding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To make your business successful, you need to be able to deal with all of them…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) The Nice Clients</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many of your clients will not have the slightest idea what goes into making a Web</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They will be quite content to work with you as you lead them through the design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>process. When they disagree with something you propose, they will normally</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>accept your judgment as long as you offer a reasonable explanation.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For the most part, these people are just like you, and working with them will be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>very pleasant. Communicate with them openly and often and things will go very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>smoothly.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) The Non-responsive Clients</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One day a client will contact you about a Web site, sign a contract, send you the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>first payment… and then he will drop off the face of the planet.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He will not provide the information that you need. The graphics that you ask for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will never arrive. And when you ask for reviews of your work, you will not get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them. Behavior like this may sound odd, but it is really one of the most common</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>problems you will face with clients.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Why would anyone pay for a Web site and then not support its development?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>He expects you to do everything. That’s why he hired you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>He has no idea how to create content for a Web site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>He is afraid of making a mistake.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Your questions and requests intimidate him.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>He has more pressing things to do.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>He doesn’t know how to use e-mail.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you deal with this?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Probably the best way to approach this is to call your client as soon as you see</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this problem developing. He might ignore your e-mail, but once you have him on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the phone, he will normally talk to you. This may be the only way that you will get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If a phone call doesn’t work, then what?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Picture this scenario… You set up your contract so that you received an initial</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>payment (correct action). Then you started on the job and reached a point where</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you could go no further without input or reviews from the client. You contacted</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the client repeatedly (you have copies of the e-mails). And you have had no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>response.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What do you do at this point?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Stop working.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Notify your client that you have reached a contract milestone and can do no more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>work on the site until everything is approved and the next payment is made.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Send the notice by registered mail so that you will have confirmation of delivery.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After they receive a notice, some clients will fuss because the site is not as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>complete as they think it should be, and they will finally send the information that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you need. Others will fuss but still won’t send any information, and some will still</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not respond.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Continue to work with the clients that responded to the registered letter. File the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>others away. Send an e-mail to the non-responders every three or four weeks. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they still haven’t responded after a few months, just give up. Put all of their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>records in a safe place and focus your efforts on paying clients.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be careful not to burn any bridges -- they may be back.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>3) The Demanding Client</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>While the non-responsive client is frustrating, the demanding client is irritating.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The demanding client has the type of personality that has to be in control of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everything. These clients will ignore most of the advice you give them regarding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>good site design practices, and they will insist that you do everything their way.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They will tell you what to do and exactly how to do it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Clients like this can be a real challenge. Fortunately, these traits normally show</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>up in the client interview and you can usually avoid contracting with overly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>demanding clients.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you do get one, be sure to <B>document every conversation. </B>Get all change</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>instructions in writing (e-mail) and verify all verbal directions by e-mail (...as we</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agreed on the phone...). In the event of a legal dispute, your e-mail</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>documentation will demonstrate that you provided advice and that the client</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chose to ignore it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A demanding client presents a real problem for a conscientious designer. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to design the best Web site possible, and your client will direct you to do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>things that you know will reduce the effectiveness of the site. All you can do is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>inform your client of the drawbacks of his approach, and then do as you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>instructed.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s his site and he is paying the bill. Give him what he wants, even if it is not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what he needs.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Client personalities directly affect the way you “do” business and can often cause</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>communication difficulties. Unfortunately, your challenges do not stop there.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are a few other problems that may show up along the way. Don’t worry.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These concerns are not insurmountable. By being aware of what could happen,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can tackle any concern immediately and effectively.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s start with a concern that happens fairly frequently…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>• Lack of Direction</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some clients feel their task is done after they sign the contract and send you the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>first payment. These are the ones who see a Web site as a commodity that is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>purchased as one would purchase a pair of shoes. The materials that they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>submit are sketchy and vague because they don’t know what they need. They</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are not really non-responsive. They just have no concept of the design or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>marketing issues involved.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It can be difficult to identify these people during the initial interview. Once you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>get one, you may wind up developing the contents of their Web site for them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is fine if that is what you contracted to do. If it isn’t, you need to let them</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know that there is a problem.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If your agreement does not include developing site content and copywriting, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to stop working and re-negotiate your agreement. Just be sure to do this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tactfully so as not to drive your client away.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>• Submission of Materials</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Every Web site development task requires some input from the clients.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes, the submissions will be unusable. Graphics/photos will be of poor</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>quality and text will be poorly written or just a series of notes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Deal with this as a contract issue. If the client is to provide photos and they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provide bad ones, put a couple online for them to see. If they are satisfied, get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>written approval via e-mail and you are covered. If they are not satisfied, ask</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them to provide new ones. You may also have the option of buying or creating</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the images yourself (at an additional charge).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How you handle the text will also depend on the initial contract you established.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If the client is responsible for providing all site content, let him know that there is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a problem and explain the impact in terms of labor hours and cost.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are responsible for doing the copywriting, but you don’t have sufficient</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information, you can either stop working or you can take your best shot at it and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>submit it for their review. Sometimes clients just need a place to start and they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will be able to edit what you have written.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be sure to keep the lines of communication open to avoid creating</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>misunderstandings and resentment.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>• Scope Creep</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your contract should clearly define the scope of the work involved.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most clients will ask for more once you begin. Some will do this intentionally, but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most will not realize that they are doing it. Be careful how you deal with these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>requests. Many of the requests will be trivial and you will want to do them just to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>keep your client happy. But some will require hours of work.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t hesitate to inform the client that these requests are beyond the scope of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the contract and that they will have impact on cost and schedule.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As the site is being developed, the client should have some input as to its final</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appearance. However, once a client approves the overall layout, further layout</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>changes are “out of scope.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you get one of these requests, send an e-mail that identifies it as a change</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of scope. Outline the impact, give a time and cost estimate, and cite a specific</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clause in the contract. The client will then have the option to proceed or cancel</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the request.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>• Preconceived Ideas</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most clients start off with some idea of what they want in their Web sites. Some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of these ideas will be good. Others will not be so great. You need to support the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>good ones and eliminate the bad ones, and you need to do this very tactfully.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your client probably thought about these ideas for a long time before contacting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you, and many of them will be firmly planted in her vision of the site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The best way to convince clients that their ideas have potential problems is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>simply to explain your concerns in terms of site performance (i.e., “Large images</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mean slow loading time and drive visitors away,” or “Pages with no text suffer in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Search Engine rankings.”) This shows that you really know what you are talking</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about and that you have the client’s best interests at heart.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Communication has to be two-way. You are the Web site expert so the client</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>should listen to you. The client is the business expert (i.e., knows own</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers and business) so the Webmaster should listen to her. Both parties</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to work together.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In most cases, the client will accept your judgment and give up on the idea… but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not always. If there is a real issue, a quick search of the Internet will usually</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provide several references that will support your point of view. Consider sharing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this with your client. Let her know that the final choice is hers and that you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>just making sure that she has sufficient information to make her decision.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be very careful about how you do this. You want to educate your client, not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>offend her. If your client still wants the idea incorporated into the site, put it in. It</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is her site and she is paying the bills.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Whenever you deal with people, there is a possibility of conflict.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some conflict is good. It can encourage the creation of new and different ideas.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some conflict is bad. It can create negative feelings and can slow down or stop</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the business process.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you run into a problem and you don’t know how to deal with it, determine</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whether it is an interpersonal issue (you and your client just can’t agree) or a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contract issue (your client has asked for something that is not in your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agreement).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Just remember…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your clients are people. They are paying you to provide a service. Treat them</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with respect and give them what they want in a professional manner. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>follow this advice, your business will prosper.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One small caveat…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some people are just plain nasty. Life is too short. Find a way to “fire” them if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they are abusive and move on. (Of course, this requires a mutually acceptable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>termination of contract between the two parties.)</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>We are now at the last (and certainly not least) section of this Course -- the art of formulating winning (and legal) proposals and contracts...</FONT>
