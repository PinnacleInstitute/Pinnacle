<B><FONT size=4>Attracting New Clients</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Too many new designers make the mistake of putting up a Web site, sitting back,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and waiting for the phone to ring. If only business was that easy.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are thousands of designers promoting their services on the Internet.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of them are very good at getting top Search Engine rankings for their Web</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site. However, unless your site shows up within the first few pages of the Search</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Engine listings, most searchers will never even see it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t have a Web site. A good site is an important</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>part of your promotional activities. You just have to realize that although your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site is a contact point and a place to show off your skills and abilities, it probably</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>won’t be your primary advertising tool.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So how do you find work?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>You find clients by advertising.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, this won’t be “broadcast” advertising where you put your message in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>front of millions of people in hopes that one of them will call you. Instead, it will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be <B>focused </B>directly at your target market -- small business owners who are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>already looking for your services.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your clients aren’t going to come to you. <B>You have to go to them.</B></FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>There are several effective strategies for getting new clients. This Course will</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>provide a few pointers to get you started in the right direction. As always, a much</FONT></FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Design Business.</FONT></FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Do a quick examination of Web site designer ads in the newspaper, in the phone</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>book, and on the Internet. You will notice that most of them are very poorly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>done.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The colors are bright. The graphics are nice. The layouts are very attractive.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But the advertising copy in most of these ads is absolutely terrible.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here’s an advertisement that I found under a “Web Site Development” heading in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>my local phone book…</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There were dozens of ads under Web Site Development and this was the best of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the lot. How pitiful! If you were a business owner, and you weren’t experienced</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with the Internet, would you know if you needed a database? Would you know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the difference between ASP and XML? Would this ad mean anything to you?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Probably not. And it won’t mean anything to the majority of your clients either.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You need to speak to your clients in terms that they will understand. You have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>focus on their businesses and on their needs. Potential clients want to know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what you can do for them. So when you write your advertising copy,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>remember…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Your clients are small businesses that advertise but don’t have Web sites.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Your clients want their businesses to be more successful.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>With these two points in mind, we can rewrite the ad to look like this…</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Isn’t this what your clients are looking for? It says, “I understand what you need</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and I can help you get it.” Figure out what your clients want and show them that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can provide the appropriate solution. It’s okay to list <B>your </B>credentials and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>skills, but remember that “all about you” is secondary to your clients’ needs.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Your clients’ needs always come first.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This same approach applies to all of the advertising you do whether it is on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Internet, in print, or face-to-face. Focus on the client. Describe the benefits of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>having a Web site. Use terms that will appeal to the client (ex., saving time,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>saving money, increasing profits, etc.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You don’t need to convince them that you are the greatest designer on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>planet. You just have to <B>convince them that you understand their problems</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>and that you can help to solve them. </B>This is why understanding your target</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>market is so very important. The better you know what your clients need, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>better equipped you are to meet those needs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Where you position your promotional material is just as important as the material</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>itself. If you put it in the wrong place, your target market will never see it and you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will have wasted your time, effort, and money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Place your advertising where potential clients will see it. Ask yourself these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions about your target market…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Where do they go?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What do they read?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Who do they talk to?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What do they like to do?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What interests do they have?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And most important…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Where are they likely to see or hear your promotions?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Local small business owners often belong to community associations and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business associations, and they usually support community activities. So</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consider joining your local Chamber of Commerce and other local business and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>community associations. These networking opportunities will give you a chance</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to meet prospective clients in a relaxed setting.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Organizations/associations also distribute newsletters to their members on a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>regular basis. Put your ad into one of these newsletters and it will be delivered</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>directly into the hands of your target market.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In addition, every business segment has its own trade journals, meetings,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>conventions, Web sites, etc. These can all be great places to advertise because</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they already have the attention of your target market.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The bottom line is…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t waste your time and money trying to flood the marketplace with your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>promotions. Position your advertising where the right people will find it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here are three promotional strategies to get the ball rolling…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) Spread the word</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your own "word of mouth" is your best marketing tool. Tell everyone.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>EVERYONE</B>!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Tell all your friends, relatives, and co-workers that you are starting a Web site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>design business and are openly looking for clients. The more people know about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this exciting development, the more likely the news will get passed along to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>right ears.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When an opportunity to discuss your business comes up, make sure that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cash in on it. When people around you are discussing the Internet, join the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>conversation. Casually work in references about your design experience and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your new business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be careful with this though, because it is easy to overdo this casual type of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>promotion. If your friends start avoiding you, you may want to ease up a bit.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) Cash in on free publicity</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The best publicity you can get is free. Get your name in the newspaper. Contact</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your local community paper and tell them about your new business. They might</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>send someone out to interview you, and your business could get some free</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>press. It’s an easy way to introduce your services to the community.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you design a site for a well-known national business, tell your local paper. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is the kind of human interest story that small papers love. Even if you don’t make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the front page, the exposure will create a buzz locally.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Newspapers also know that if they give support to local businesses (that’s you),</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they often get support back in the form of advertising. So don’t be hesitant to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contact a reporter.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>3) Become a contributing author</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Try writing a column, such as “Promoting Your Business on the Internet,” for your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>local paper, Chamber of Commerce, community association, or business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>association newsletter -- anywhere to get your name in front of your target</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>audience.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This may seem like a stretch if you are just starting out. You may not have the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>skills and experience to do this yet. Don’t worry… you will soon.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once you really start learning the craft, you will be amazed at how much more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you know than everyone else does. You will also be surprised at how quickly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you become a recognized expert after your name has been in print a few times.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Writing takes a little effort on your part, but it is free advertising and it can pay off</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>handsomely if you choose your forums carefully. However, be sure that you only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>submit articles to publications geared to your target group. Otherwise, it’s not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>worth your time and effort.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>These are three simple techniques to get your name out to your target audience</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>effectively and inexpensively (an important consideration when you are just</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>starting up a business). They require some effort on your part, but the payoff is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>worth it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(If you need additional ideas, <B>Start Your Own Home-Based Website Design</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Business </B>has more than twenty promotional techniques that will help you find</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>work.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The thought of “promoting yourself” to others may make you a little</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>uncomfortable, but it’s just part of the job. You had to learn HTML, layout, and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>design. Self-promotion is just another skill that you have to master to make your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business work.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You don’t have to be pushy. You don’t have to be obnoxious. Just be friendly,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>courteous, and informative. Don’t spend your limited time with potential clients</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>talking about your business and your problems. Talk about theirs. People like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people who listen to them. Once you have established a relationship with your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>client… <B>and </B>understand his or her business needs… you will be in a position to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>recommend solutions. (Solutions = you!)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Just remember to keep your advertising focused on your clients’ needs. Figure</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>out what they want and need to make their business better…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Then tell them how you can help them get it.</FONT>
