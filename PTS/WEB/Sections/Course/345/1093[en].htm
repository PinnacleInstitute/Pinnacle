<B><FONT size=4>Introduction</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Every day, thousands of people think about starting their own Webmaster</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. Some want to break away from the daily drudgery of working for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone else. Some crave the flexibility of working from home. Some need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>supplement their main income. Some feel they are ready to expand their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services beyond their circle of contacts. Still others… the list of personal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reasons could go and on.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But here’s the catch…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Every day, most of these people do nothing but dream.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>The Webmaster BUSINESS Masters Course </B>was written for Webmasters who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are ready to stop dreaming and start building a home-based Web site design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That’s <B>you!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps you are presently employed full-time/part-time in the field. Or perhaps</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you design sites for relatives, friends or associates as a favor in your spare time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It doesn’t matter. You already know, based on current and past experiences,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that consumer demand for Webmaster services is substantial and that it’s not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about to evaporate anytime soon. You are definitely not embarking on a highrisk</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business proposition.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On top of that, you will have all of the advantages of working from home…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>no office to rent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>no boss telling you what to do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>flexibility to pick your own hours</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>ability to generate income in your living room</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>and the biggest advantage of all, you’re the person in charge. You decide how,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>when and where you want to work.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>The Webmaster BUSINESS Masters Course </B>will get your business rolling in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the right direction. It gives an insider's view into some of the variables involved in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>setting up a business, creating a contract, working with clients, and other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>important operational aspects. This Course will help you avoid common</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>problems and mistakes, the kind that cost you time and money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Please note… The Webmaster BUSINESS Masters Course </B>won’t teach you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how to design Web sites or help you layout pages or show you any cute HTML</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tricks. You must already have that under control or you wouldn’t be getting ready</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to hang out your business shingle.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>The Webmaster BUSINESS Masters Course </B>will, however, help you establish</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your business on solid footing and position yourself as a successful independent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>designer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A quick overview of the Course will answer your question…</FONT>

<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Just one more thing before we launch into the Course…some brief introductions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You first…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are reading this, chances are you fall into one of three categories…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Category #1 </B>-- You like designing Web sites and you want to do more of them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In your Net travels, you have found lots of material on site design. But you have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>come to the realization that there is a real shortage of information on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“business end” of things.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You also like the thought of having your own business, working from home, and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>getting paid to do something you like.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Category #2 </B>-- You have already started your own Web site design business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(either formally or informally) but it isn’t going as well as you had hoped. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know that others are doing this successfully, but you just haven’t quite figured out</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how to make your business work. You just need a little direction and someone to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hold you by the hand until you get the hang of things.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Category #3 </B>-- You already have a successful design business and you want to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pick up a few additional tools, tips and techniques to make things go a little</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>smoother.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whatever your category is, welcome to <B>The Webmaster Business Masters</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Course!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And now, let me introduce myself. My name is <B>Mark Frank. </B>I have been</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>operating my own home-based Web site design business since 1998 (forever in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Internet time!). When I started my business, I had no experience running a small</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business and I had only designed a couple of Web sites. Even so, I was able to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>incorporate my business, put up a promotional Web site, and generate income</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from a computer in my kitchen.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I read everything that I could get my hands on, about design, business, working</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at home, etc. I took classes at the local community college in design and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. I also made every mistake I could possibly make (honestly, some of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them I repeated two or three times).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As a result, these positive and negative experiences taught me loads of valuable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lessons. I even wrote these lessons down in a book, <B>“Start Your Own Home-</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Based Website Design Business.” </B>I am sharing some of them in <B>The</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Webmasters BUSINESS Masters Course </B>but there are many more outlined in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the book. (Additional details about the book are available at the end of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Course.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I don’t claim to be the world’s greatest expert on this stuff. However, I have been</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>where you are now and I have found a path that will also take you where you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to go. I can tell you what to do to get started on the right foot, and better</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yet, I can help you stay out of trouble by telling you what <B>not </B>to do.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>So, follow the valuable guidance offered in <B>The Webmaster BUSINESS Masters</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Course. </B>Not only will you receive answers to questions you might have, you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>also receive answers to questions that you didn’t know to ask.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As an added bonus, the Course will point you towards an excellent <B>businessbuilding</B> 
<BR><B>resource</B>, called <B>Site Build It!</B>. Its comprehensive system of tools will 
<BR>help you deliver traffic-generating, successful sites (good for your clients’ 
<BR>business) in less time and with a <B>profit </B>(good for your business). 
<BR>
<BR>Now that our introductions are finished, let us get on with the Course…</FONT>
