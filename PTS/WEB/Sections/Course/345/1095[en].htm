<B><FONT size=4>Web Site Marketing Secrets</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>No business can survive without <B>marketing. </B>Not my business. Not your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. Marketing brings in clients. And clients bring in the money that keeps</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your business alive.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As Webmasters, we sharpen our design skills constantly and try to keep up with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new developments in the field -- trends, new tools, etc. However, for many of us,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>our understanding of marketing theory is less refined.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What is the core meaning of marketing?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are sales and marketing professionals who do nothing but discuss and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>debate what marketing really means. They hold seminars and write books and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>articles on the subject. In my opinion, these people have too much time on their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hands.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As far as you and I are concerned (as Webmasters), marketing means promoting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your own business and your client’s business. Anything you do to attract</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>potential customers and encourage potential sales (or whatever action creates</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>income) is marketing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You may not realize it yet, but Web site design is all about marketing. For the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most part, your clients will want to promote their products/services (i.e., their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business) online and they will pay for your Webmaster services through their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertising budgets.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Very few clients will pay thousands of dollars for a Web site just for the sake of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>having a Web site. They <B>expect a return on their investment, </B>whether that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ROI is more customers (leads), or increased sales, or cost savings due to a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reduction in customer interface time (or whatever else contributes to their bottom</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>line).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your job is to build Web sites that will achieve the kind of <B>results your clients</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>want and expect. </B>And in order to do that, you must build sites that attract</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ongoing targeted traffic, pull these interested prospects to the money-making</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web page (s) and close the deal (i.e., get the order/contract/lead/etc.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>The ability to meet client expectations is the reason why <B>Site Build It! </B>is an</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>excellent system for Webmasters. It will help you produce impressive traffic</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>In this chapter, you will learn how to define your target market by narrowing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>possibilities to a specific group of consumers. You will also hear about three</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>marketing secrets that reinforce why Web sites are more than just eye candy.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Actually, the most important secret of successful Web site design has already</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>been alluded to in the opening paragraphs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In case you missed it, here it is…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Web sites are marketing tools.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most new designers don’t recognize this reality immediately. And a surprising</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>number of experienced designers don’t know this either. They design sites that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are beautiful looking. Unfortunately, their client sites don’t rank well with Search</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Engines and as a result, there is no traffic generated. The content on these sites</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is not focused on the needs of customers so that when visitors do stop by, they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“click out” instead of clicking on the client’s money-making links -- those links that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lead to sales/service contracts/leads/referrals/contact.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These sites may be beautiful… but they are failures all the same.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They are failures because they don’t get results.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your clients need successful Web sites in order to develop successful online</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>businesses. They need sites that do the following (these are just a few examples</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to spark the discussion) …</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Rank well with the Search Engines</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Attract interested targeted visitors</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Are focused on the needs of their visitors</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Keep visitors on site (and encourage repeat visits)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Get the desired response (contact, buy, etc.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In your work as a Web designer, these needs must drive your actions. As I said</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>earlier, your ability to create successful business sites for your clients will directly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>determine the growth of your own Webmaster business. They win… you win.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Designing for success is a much bigger job than just putting up some content,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>adding some photos, using multi-media, etc. and because of that, you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>charge hundreds or thousands of dollars for your services (more on this in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Chapter 5). Your design efforts must produce <B>results… traffic and sales.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Secret #1 is so obvious that we often miss it (i.e., Web sites are marketing tools).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, it’s a secret you and your business can’t afford to miss.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Secret #2 involves “targeting” and its role in the marketing equation.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How would you complete the following sentence?…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“I am planning to sell my services to….”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you say “anyone,” you are mistaken.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>“Anyone” </B>is not your market. It is unlikely that you will sell Web sites services to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>any of the following groups…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Children</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Retired couples who want to do extensive travelling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>People who don't want Web sites</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Businesses with no advertising budgets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can’t be all things to all people. Cost-effective marketing (in both time and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money) requires <B>focus. </B>It matches the needs/desires of the most appropriate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>target group with your “solution” (i.e., services).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So how do you identify your best niche? Begin by asking yourself the following</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Who hires Webmasters?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Why do they hire?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What do they want?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What do they need?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What solutions do I offer that meets these needs?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What makes my solutions unique?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Jot down your answers. Add some of your own questions. The goal of this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>exercise is to find the <B>ideal balance. </B>You want to identify a target group/niche</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that is neither too general (too much competition) nor too narrow (not enough</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>potential clients).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=4><B><FONT color=#0033ff>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>You will do this same exercise many times in the future -- not for you but for your</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>clients. “Narrowing the focus” can sometimes be a challenge for small business</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>owners. However, most can’t afford trial and error testing before they identify the</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>right niche for their type of business.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Some of your future clients will require your assistance to find their niche. Unless</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>you are knowledgeable about their business, you will have to get up to speed by</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>surfing for information. Or you can save time with <B>Site Build It!.</B></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>SBI! </B>uses a proven process for identifying the most profitable niche markets. Its</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>brainstorming tool </B>will research related keywords/keyword phrases and provide</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>their profitability ratio at the click of a button.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>You don’t have to be an expert in marketing theory with <B>Site Build It!. </B>And your</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>clients will never know how easy your research was. They will just see resultsproducing</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>marketing in action.</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>Back to your own niche-identifying exercise…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your “specific” answers and niche will be unique to your own situation. However,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for the purpose of this Course, we’ll keep your niche more neutral …</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your target group is <B>small business owners </B>without a Web site who recognize</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that they need one. Now go one step further…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your target group is small business owners without a Web site who recognize</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that they need one and have money available for advertising.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Narrow your focus again… Your target group is small business owners without a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web site who recognize that they need one, have money available for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertising, and have a budget big enough to hire an independent professional</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web designer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Not a surprising conclusion when you think about it. However, you would be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>surprised at the number of Web site designers that try to market to the entire</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>world!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So when you start looking for contracts, focus your design and marketing efforts</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on your particular niche. Why?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Simple economics…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>That’s where the work is.</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>At this point in the “narrowing down” process, it’s important to determine the price</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>range for your services -- low, mid and high-end-- and exactly what type of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services are available at each price level. This framework will direct your future</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>marketing efforts. So what’s the connection?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Economic factors come into play once again. For the most part, the advertising</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>budgets of the different segments within your target market will mirror your price</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>range. In other words, some small business owners will have more money to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spend on your services than others do. You need to decide which type of clients</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you want to attract… those who demand high-end, or those who want mid-range,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or those who seek low-end services.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A rough pricing framework might look like this…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Low End ($100 to $200 per page) = simple pre-designed template, a 2-page</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>brochure-style Web site, client provides content, basic Web presence, etc.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Mid Range ($2000-$3000 per site) = some customization, content editorial</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>assistance, graphic design, traffic generation, marketing advice, etc.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>High End ($4000-$5000 per site) = more customization, content development,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>graphic design, traffic generation, traffic stats collection and reporting, ongoing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site maintenance, marketing, etc.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Realistically, in the start-up phase of your business, most of your work will come</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from <B>clients looking for low to mid-range priced services. </B>So here are a few</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>things to consider with these two particular groups…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Low-end </B>service has some distinct advantages. Simple construction and predesigned</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>templates allow you to produce several Web sites very quickly. Even</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>though the profit per job is low, you can make it up in volume. A decent income</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is achievable as long as you can establish a steady flow of work.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Like any business decision, there are pluses and minuses to consider. On the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>plus side, it is much easier to find work in this price range. Many small business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>owners have no idea what is involved in designing a Web site. The low-end price</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>range fits with their preconceived price notions and more importantly, their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertising budgets.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On the minus side, any design job requires client interface. The more time you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spend working directly with individual clients, the lower your hourly income is and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the fewer jobs you can do.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The key is to <B>clearly define what the client gets for the price… and stick with</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>it. </B>Maintain a balance between good client service and reasonable support. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you don't, the job can easily take two or three times longer than you initially</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expected. When that happens, you are moving from low-end to “zero-end”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>territory -- a huge waste of time and money for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>At the <B>mid-range </B>price level, work is harder to find, but it pays better. These</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clients expect more than “just a Web site.” They expect you to be able to talk to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them about Search Engines/traffic generation, Internet marketing, and what a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web site can/should do to promote their businesses.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Usually, fees for these designs are quoted by the job, with an hourly rate for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unscheduled labor, changes, and support. The jobs tend to be bigger than the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lower-priced work, and they require much more time investment in dealing with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clients.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are new to Web site design and marketing, your best option is to start with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>low-priced designs while you develop your skills. Once you have assembled a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decent portfolio, secured some testimonials, and honed your skills, you can then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>move on to mid-range, custom design work.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You may, of course, decide to stick to making lower-cost Web sites because you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enjoy that type of work and you find the income level satisfactory. Or you could</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>go for the combo. It’s up to you. It’s your business (literally) as to which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>segment of your niche market you want to target.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>The <B>SBI! </B>system will increase your profit margin for every contract, regardless of</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>which price range it fits into. With <B>SBI!, </B>you will be more productive. It will help</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>you build sites faster and make more money per site. (<B>SBI! </B>looks after the timeconsuming,</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>tedious tasks involved in traffic generation.) You can have more</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>happy clients with less effort on your part! (<B>http://webmaster.sitesell.com</B>/)</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And now it’s time for the final marketing secret for your Webmaster business to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be revealed. It’s short and sweet.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Always write content directed at your primary clients. </B>This applies to all your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>promotional efforts -- Web site, direct mail, phone calls, print advertising,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You might be tempted to make your copy appeal to other groups that you think</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may want to hire you. <B>Don’t. </B>When you identify other potential markets, run a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>separate advertising effort for them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The most profitable marketing is specific to a clearly identified market. If you try</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to make it appeal to everyone, it will appeal to no one. And your site will be in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the Search Engine hinterland, far away from those traffic-producing first-page</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>search results positions.</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR>
<BR><FONT size=3><B>For the best ROI, don’t dilute your marketing efforts. </B>Keep your focus on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people who already want/need your services -- your niche.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s a good time to note that sometimes you will attract prospects within your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>niche that are definitely not your ideal clients. People will contact you who want</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>very complex Web sites for a cheap price like $200 or $300, or by people who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>believe that everything on the Internet is free, and/or by people who do not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>realize the distinction between a Web site and an effective Web site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your first response will be to try to sell the <B>value </B>of your services to these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people. You will spend precious time sending/answering e-mails and writing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>proposals. Then, without any warning, there is a break in communication and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman"><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you don’t hear from them again. What a waste! These people were not your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>target market in the first place.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After you have done this a few times, you will realize that people with unrealistic</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expectations almost never become paying clients, even if they appear to be part</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of your target market. What’s the solution?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this case, respond to their e-mail (or follow-up phone messages) with a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>standard e-mail (customize the template as required). Clearly outline your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services and price ranges. Then wait for a response. The ball is in their court.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s important to educate potential clients, but for the most part, be very selective</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with your time. You will almost never get certain prospects to sign on the dotted</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>line. Try not to show impatience or frustration. Treat all prospects with courtesy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and professionalism. Even if they don’t hire you, they may pass your name to</FONT>
