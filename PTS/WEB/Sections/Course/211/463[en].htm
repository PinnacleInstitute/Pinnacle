<CENTER><H1>Facilitated Communication Training: Practice Guidelines</H1></CENTER>

<P>The <B>Vermont Facilitated Communication Network</B> has developed the following guidelines for the use of facilitated communication (FC). The intent of these guidelines is to support the effective and appropriate use of FC. FC speakers and their teams can use these guidelines as a planning and evaluating tool. It is important that all members of a FC speaker's team be familiar with them so that they are able to make informed decisions regarding the use of FC.

<UL>Support and commitment from a FC speaker's team is critical to their long term success with FC. It is important to gain consensus from the team on the use of FC. While members of a team may have varying perspectives on the efficacy and validity of FC, it is important that their discussions not become polarized. To assist team members in making decisions about the use of FC, it is important that they all receive basic information on what FC is and how it works. They need to be able to understand why the person they are involved with might be a good candidate. As part of this educational process, it is often helpful to have people with extensive experience with FC available to answer questions, provide new information, and problem solve around specific issues and concerns.

<UL>In order to be innvested in the FC training process, speakers should be involved on a regular basis in decisions which relate to the types and levels of support they need for successful communication, activities, communication aids and devices, and plans for specific issues and concerns.

<P>FC is used within the context of a total communication approach.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>FC should be part of a structured plan for developing an individual's communication skills which may incorporate its use with other augmentative communication strategies such as sign language, natural gestures, and electronic devices. This plan needs to include ongoing assessment, instruction, and evaluation. In making decisions about how FC should be used in a person's life, it is important that teams review all the possible opportunities and needs for communication that a person has in their everyday life and figure out which mode best meets the particular communication demands of each situation. For example, an indivdual may be able to use speech or sign language to indicate their choice of food at meal times but may need FC to participate more fully in classroom social studies lessons.

<P>Facilitators are trained and work under close monitoring and supervision.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>The complexities involved in good facilitation require that facilitators receive intensive training that combines classroom learning with coaching from an experienced facilitator. It is important that organizations have a process in place to provide training to new facilitators. This may include providing extensive training to an in-house person who can serve as a resource for the orgaanization or developing relationships with outside FC consultants.
<BR>

<LI>
<P>FC speakers are supported by more than one facilitator, and by facilitators with whom they have regular involvement.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>An important part of the FC planning process for an individual needs to include identifying a number of facilitators, identifying their training and support needs, and providing opportunities for failitators to communicate regularly about their work with the individual.
<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<P>FC speakers have multiple opportunities for practice with FC throughout their day and across a variety of settings including home, school/work, and community.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>Success with FC is often dependent on the frequency with which an individual is able to have access to using it. Facilitators along with members of a speaker's team need to spend time planning structured, learning activities which relate to the speaker's interests and needs. They also need to plan opportunities where the speaker can use FC to make choices about things in their lives.
<BR>
<BR>

<LI>
<P>FC speakers have access to a variety of communication aids and devices.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>While many FC speakers utilize communication boards, they can benefit from exploring the use of electronic devices and adaptations. Devices which have visual feedback and voice output and software programs which assist in the process of writing can enhance the efficiency and independence of their communication. It is helpful to get input from augmentative communication specialists, occupational therapists, and physical therapists on the appropriate aids and devices to use.
<BR>

<LI>
<P>The goal of independence is emphasized throughout the FC training process.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>Working towards independence means both fading back the physical support and increasing a person's ability to initiate communication. It also involves teaching an individual strategies to help them monitor their own communication more with less dependence on prompting and direction from their facilitators. It is important that speakers be involved in developing plans for working on independence. Because of physical limitation, it is possible that some individuals may never be able to achieve total independence. This should not preclude their using FC especially if they are able to make progress in using less support and increasing their initiation of communication.

<P>Validation of the source of typing is an important and natural part of the process of learning to use FC.
<BR>
<BR></B>
<UL>If the above guidelines are followed, it is likely that examples of valid communication can be obtained through naturalistic methods. Speakers and their facilitators should view the process of validation as a skill to be learned and not a test of the speaker's abilities. A communication portfolio should be established for the speaker which documents over time instances of valid communication. Indicators of validity to be documented would include the following:
<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>similar patterns of spelling and typographical errors across facilitators
<BR>
<LI>typing of similar topics and themes across facilitators 
<LI>consistent style of typing across facilitators
<BR>
<LI>instances of independent and/or initiated communication
<BR>
<LI>sharing of information not known to the facilitator
<BR>
<LI>behavior or actions which confirms typed communication
<BR>
<LI>speech which correlates with typed communication
<BR>
<LI>consistent physical style of typing across facilitators
<BR>
<LI>physical attention to the typing
