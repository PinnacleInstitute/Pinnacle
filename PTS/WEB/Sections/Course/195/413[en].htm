Yes we all need to make a living.&nbsp;Years ago when I was first in school, I will never forget what my first teacher had told me.&nbsp; "Do what you love and the money will follow".&nbsp; 
<P>He was absolutely right.&nbsp; I am doing what I love to do, and not only did the money followed, but all many other blessings that I never knew was possible.
