<P align=center><B>People are going to come to you from all walks of life, needing help and guidance.&nbsp; Is is our duty as 'Practitioners" </B>
<P align=center><B>To help them in the best way we can, or if we can't help them whether is it out of our scope of practice, or we have done all we can for them with only limited results, then we need to guide them to where they need to be next. </B>
<P align=center><B>In my field, people are always asking me about other modalities in alternative healing.&nbsp;Usually it is because they read about it in the paper or saw it on the 5:00 news.&nbsp; If I cannot accurately answer them at that moment, I tell them that I will get back to them on it.&nbsp; Then I go home, and either reference my extensive library, or I go on the internet and do the research.&nbsp; Then as soon as I feel competent enough to give then an educated answer, I respond back to them. </B>
<P align=center><B>Below is a common list of alternative methods of healing and a brief discription of each. </B>
<P align=left><B><U>Massage and Bodywork</U></B> 
<P align=left><B>Lymph Drainage:</B> a gentle pumping massage which works to speed up the removel of waste products in the body by stimulting the lymphatic system 
<P align=left><B>Swedish</B> : A relaxation type of massage using different kinds of strokes.&nbsp; From effleurage, to kneading, pressures, friction, tapotement.&nbsp; 
<P align=left>Effleurage: a gliding stroke with hands open, palms on body. 
<P align=left>Kneading: A "wringing" type of movement. 
<P align=left>Pressures: using thumbs, elbows, or other tool to induce pressure on a particular part of the body.(never over boney landmarks) 
<P align=left>Friction: a fast movement usually done swith the pads of fingers to break up adhesions in the muscles. 
<P align=left>tapotement:&nbsp; done with hands or tools, a tapping, pummeling&nbsp; or "beating" technique to increase blood flow and invigorate the body. 
<P align=left><B>Reflexology</B> : based on the philosophy that there are certain pressure points in the foot which lead to organs in the body.&nbsp; By stimulating these points therefore stimulates the healing activity&nbsp; which is needed in that particular area. 
<P align=left><B>Aromatherapy</B> : the use of essential oils whether added to the massage oil, in a bath&nbsp;or just infused into the room. 
<P align=left>Many believe that when blended the right way, they can potentially have medicinal effects on the body mind and spirit. 
<P align=left><B>Stone Therapy</B> :&nbsp; The use of warmed and sometimes cooled stones on the body either done as a massage or placed on the body to have certain positive effects on the body.&nbsp; The heated stones can produce a state of relaxation and warmth in the muscles, while the cold stones can help with inflammation. 
<P align=left><B>Ear coning</B> : the use of a "cone" which is muslin dipped in wax.&nbsp; Looks a lot like a hollowed out taper candle.&nbsp; the smaller end is placed right at the opening of the ear canal while the larger end is lit on fire.&nbsp; In turn it blows a warm smoke in the ear melting all the wax, and it just naturally flows out of the ear canal when done.&nbsp; The sinus points are stimulated while this is done helping ease headaches and sinus pressure. 
<P align=left><B>Colon Hydrotherapy</B> :&nbsp; The use of a self contained machine to clean out the lower part of the intestine.&nbsp; Like a high enema.&nbsp; May be beneficial in preventing colon cancer, diverticulosis, IBS, and toxicity of the body. 
<P align=left><B><U>Energywork and Healing</U></B> 
<P align=left><B>Reiki:</B> &nbsp; based on the principles of the universal life force working through the healer and helping the client to come to a state of balance whether physical, meantal, or emotional. 
<P align=left><B>Homeopathy</B> :&nbsp; using certain combinations of "remedies" to heal the mind body and spirit.&nbsp; In some cases the remedy is taken and the original symptoms get worse for a short time.&nbsp; In this short time, the body kicks in and fights it's way back to balance.&nbsp; It is a very gentle but effective method.&nbsp; The Homeopathic practitioner does an extensive "interview" the first time you see him/her so he/she can know exactly what remedy to prescribe.&nbsp;remedies can be bought over the counter at your local health food store, but I strongly suggest seeing a certified homeopathic doctor for help.&nbsp; 
<P align=left><B>Acupuncture</B> :&nbsp; A chinese method of healing.&nbsp; The use of needles to stimulate various "acu points" in the body for the healing of the individual as a whole.&nbsp; Very little pain is involved.&nbsp; This is very much an energetic form of healing.&nbsp; When needles are applied it may activate stagnant energy in a meridian(energy pathway), or dissipate when there is too much energy.&nbsp; The acupuncturist also may use different tools in his treatment.&nbsp; Moxa: is an herb usually burned either close to the skin or on top of the skin(placed on a thin piece of ginger).&nbsp; Moxa is used to "heat up an area", and clear energy.&nbsp; Also the use of electrodes on the needles help to magnify their strength. 
<P align=left>An acupuncturist may also prescribe certain teas and herbs for the various problems that you may be experiencing also&nbsp;a great compliment to your treatment. 
<P align=left><B>Acupressure</B> :&nbsp; The same&nbsp;idea and principle of acupuncture except no needles are involved, usually thumb/elbow pressures are applied to various "acu points".&nbsp; &nbsp;Also helps with sore trigger points in the muscles. 
<P align=left><B>Shiatsu</B> :&nbsp; A japanese form of massage very similar to acupressure.&nbsp; Usually done on a mat on the floor.&nbsp; Thumb, elbow and palm pressures are applied to the body in a downward motion. 
<P align=left>These are just a few of the more frequetly asked asked about modalities.&nbsp; There are hundreds more out there.&nbsp; The internet has a wealth of knowledge.&nbsp; I just wanted you to have a basic starter to open your mind into the many field of Alternative medicine we have out there. 
<P align=left>I suggest that if you intend on being in this field of alternative medicine that you CONTIONUE TO EDUCATE YOURSELF!&nbsp; Take as many classes and workshops as possible.&nbsp; Also start building your home reference library.&nbsp; 
<P align=left>Also you can learn a lot from your clients!&nbsp; 
<P align=left>One more point, I mentioned at the beginng of this lesson about if you feel that your clients problem is "out of your scope of practice", never feel ashamed, or too proud to refer them out.&nbsp; Start networking with other practitioners, and DOCTORS in your area.&nbsp; I have quite a few doctors, chiropractors, and holistic practitoners in my area and we have been referring back and forth for years.&nbsp; It builds good character and a great clientele!&nbsp; But that is to come in the later lessons.
