<B><FONT size=4>Learn from the Pros</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To build a successful Net auction business, you need to know what to do and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what <B>not </B>to do.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And the best way to accomplish this, of course, is analyze what your fellow</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctioneers have done well and what they have done poorly. We have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>already seen some examples of smart and foolish selling but now it’s time to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>highlight specific details...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Smart Selling Tactics</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s start on a positive note and look at the “right” tactics...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Offer incredible value </B>- If you offer your customer incredible <B>value,</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you will attract large numbers of buyers. That’s simply a no-brainer. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, let’s look at a listing which is offering digital cameras for $1...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=LastofStock.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/LastofStock.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Is the seller serious? Is he has studied his market and knows perfectly well</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that the price will rise as more and more people bid. In fact, let’s look at two</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>previous auctions that began in the same way...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Closed.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Closed.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>and...</FONT></B> 
<P><IMG alt=NewCameras.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/NewCameras.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In both of these auctions, he sold only 20 cameras at a time yet he had over</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>200 bids each time. The price went to $60 and $68.50. So why does he start</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the bidding at only $1? Simple. He wants to <B>entice </B>buyers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Warning... Don’t start items at some really low bid until you have done your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>homework. <B>Know the value of your item and its market. </B>You might</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>face the awful situation of either losing a pile of money on your auction or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>getting thrown off your auction site. Talk about a losing proposition.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) When you ship your merchandise, offer another product </B>- Be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sure to include information on your other products. This way, the customer is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>paying to receive your advertising material. What can be sweeter than that?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is an incredibly powerful way to build a business. As an example, here is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a section of an ad that I received in some merchandise that I bought…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Ad.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Ad.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The seller wanted me to join his wholesale buying club. So I paid for shipping</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and he won a chance to make more money from me. Put this strategy on your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“do” list.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Always remember the back end </B>- All entrepreneurs need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>understand the “back end” of every business. It is so much easier to sell to an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>already-existing customer than a new one unless your products are garbage,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of course. Marketing gurus claim that <B>it costs at least ten times as much</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>to get a new customer as it does to keep an existing one.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s say that you are auctioning comic books. Contact every person who bids.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Thank them for bidding. Build your e-mail list in this way. You aren’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spamming at all. You are simply thanking them for bidding. When you send</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this appreciative message, ask for permission to send them future notices of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items as they become available. If they are interested, you will be creating a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gold mine for yourself. And, as was discussed before, you can also keep in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contact with your customers through developing <B>newsletters.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Check out the listing below. Even though the auction has over three more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>days to run, the seller has more bids than he has supplies…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=PoloWatches.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/PoloWatches.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s easy to get the e-mail addresses of every person who bid on his watches</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and let them know whenever he has similar items in the future. After all, these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyers have already expressed interest in his product. The key is to keep the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>back end of your business at the <B>front end </B>of your mind at all times.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Make your offer irresistible </B>- The TV show, “60 Minutes,” did an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interview with a marketing genius named Bob Stupek. This brilliant man</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bought a rather run-down hotel in Las Vegas away from the famous “Strip.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The local business community snickered at the ignorance of this newcomer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He fooled them all.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He created the irresistible offer. He offered two nights lodging in a deluxe</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>room with free, unlimited cocktails and champagne, free show tickets, with big</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>name entertainers, <B>restaurant discounts and…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… $1000 to “roll the dice.” </B>All this was included in the price of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$396 per couple. In addition, there were always freebies throw in like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>vacations to Hawaii or cameras. How can he afford to do this? He counted on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people gambling, and obviously they did because the offers continued.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So how can you make your offer irresistible? One way is by providing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“excessive” value. That is, allow the customer to see that the value is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>considerably more substantial than the price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is another example of a company that has mastered this principle. Their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business model is worth careful study...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Suit.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Suit.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Further, they offer an incredible value for the price. Here is the exact copy of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the ad...</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Custom suit + accessories: The winning bidder is entitled to</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>order any style and fabric. Our extensive online fabric and</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>style choices exceed 400 options! The winning bidder will</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>also receive with our complements. Two (2) custom tailored</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>100% Egyptian cotton dress shirts . (A US$120.00 per shirt</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>retail value*.) (* GQ quoted US$240.00 per shirt ref. 06/00</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>issue) and Two (2) 100% Pure Silk hand made ties. (A</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>US$55.00 per tie retail value.) and One (1) Designer Leather</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Belt This auction item you are bidding on consists of the</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>following: One Custom Made suit, two hand made dress shirts,</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>two silk ties, one designer Leather belt and Free FedEx</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Global Shipping! The total retail value of this auction:</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>US$4800.00</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Even though they misspelled the word “complements,” it is still a very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>impressive marketing package. What other strategies have they done right?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) Lead </B>your customer to your Web site. Rather than saying something like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“check out our Web site,” their listing says “Online references available.”</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Understand your customer’s <B>mindset. </B>My very first thought when I read</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this ad was that if I were a man (and potential customer) I would be worried</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about the fit. After all, unless I am there, how can I be sure it will be right? The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>company is aware of these concerns and answers their questions at their Web</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site. An apprehensive or confused customer doesn’t buy so provide the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>necessary confidence.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Provide <B>testimonials </B>of happy customers raving about your products.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Their testimonials include e-mail addresses for verification, just like SiteSell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>does for all its products. In this way, prospective customers know that the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>testimonials are genuine. See examples at <B>http://auctions.sitesell.com/</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Which of the following two testimonials is more believable to you? The first is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from our tailors and a second is from a seller offering printer cartridges...</FONT> 
<P>&nbsp;<IMG alt=QA.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/QA.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>or...</FONT></B> 
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 543px; HEIGHT: 170px" height=160 alt=WhatOthersSay.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/WhatOthersSay.jpg" width=527 align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(Although, the tailors really should proofread their site instead of making errors</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>like “possible.”)</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Have a powerful guarantee </B>- <B>SiteSell.com </B>sets the standard. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>aren’t happy for any reason <B>you can get your money back. </B>No questions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>asked. In an auction, a powerful guarantee will definitely boost sales. It</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>removes any sense of risk. Will there be some who will take advantage? Yes,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most likely there will be but most experienced marketers don’t consider that a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>significant risk.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you offer a personal guarantee, remember to broadcast it to the world. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example…</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Just a note to let you know that I have a brand new</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>online store featuring quality gifts from around the world</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>at discount prices. For the month of October I am offering a</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>20% rebate to all first time buyers. I accept Visa,</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Mastercard and American Express through a secure server.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>The holidays are fast approaching, so now is the time to</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>start your holiday shopping. All merchandise is guaranteed</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>or your money back. No questions asked.I have many more</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>items available (over 3000), so if you do not see what you</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>are looking for email me. Also, for $5.00, I have a huge</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>beautiful catalog available. The $5.00 is refundable with</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>your first order.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Please visit my site and register even if you do not wish to</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>purchase anything at this time. Click on this link to visit</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>my store: www.affordableglobalgifts.com</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Thanks for reading my email.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Offer premiums </B>- Create desirable premiums, so your customer thinks…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“I’ve just got to have this!”...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Vacations.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Vacations.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The item price is $7.77. Looks like a pretty good deal, doesn’t it? A vacation</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and $1,000 worth of bonuses for $7.77?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Make it easy for your customers to buy </B>- Make it easy for your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers to find you and to buy from you…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Visit.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Visit.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are interested in trading cards, it would be easy to find satisfaction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is a direct link to the Web site <B>and </B>the 800 telephone number is given as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>another option.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Provide an incentive to buy more </B>- This seller offers an incentive to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buy more…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=USPS.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/USPS.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) Enlist your customers as part of your sales team </B>- This seller is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling cartridges and rewards his customers if they help him to sell his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Freeink.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Freeink.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>10) Let your customer know exactly what she is getting </B>- There are a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lot of CDs for sale on the auction sites. Many lack a clear explanation for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers to know exactly what they are about. In this case, the listing gives</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>specific details...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=TriABC.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/TriABC.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>11) Recycle your bestsellers </B>- Constantly recycle your products. Think of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new ways to sell products or combine or create new varieties of the same</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ideas.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This auctioneer sold both leather jackets and travel certificates. Here she is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>offering the jackets and including the certificates as “bonuses”…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=ExtraBonus.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/ExtraBonus.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>12) Always try for the “upsell” </B>- An enterprising seller of amethyst</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>earrings also suggests buying a pendant to go with them. Not only that, she</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>makes it easy by providing a live link that will take the buyer directly to a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>matching pendant…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=MatchingPendant.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/MatchingPendant.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For some reason, this is rarely done in listings. Take advantage of it. Why</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>settle for one sale when you can have two, or three, etc.?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>13) Publish a newsletter </B>- A newsletter will build a customer list quickly. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all your letter is going to be is “Buy! Buy! Buy!” then skip the effort unless you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have the most awesome deals in the world. But if you are specializing in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>something and want to offer information of value, then it’s very worthwhile.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>An regularly scheduled e-zine that offers customer-focused, quality content is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the perfect communication tool for building trust and credibility - I can’t stress</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this enough!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>14) Always advertise your other auctions </B>- There are many sellers who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertise their other auctions. The question is how do you want to do this?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Version #1 </B>- This is an example of how <B>not </B>to advertise. This seller lets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyers know that he has 36 other auctions. He has included a notification of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this on his auction. When the buyer looks at his listings, he will see this...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Grid.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Grid.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Imagine yourself as the buyer and think about how this works. You first click on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an item which takes you to a page that gives all the details and pictures for that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>item. You then click back to the list to see the next item. Are you likely to do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this? You’re right. It’s not the most effective approach unless you have <B>very</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>targeted traffic who don’t care about the inconvenience.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Version #2 </B>- Here is a much better way...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=WeeklySpecial.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/WeeklySpecial.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This seller has dozens and dozens of items for sale. But instead of wading</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>through all of them, she makes it easier to focus on a particular interest.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Version #3 </B>- This is my nomination for the most powerful way to display your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Merchandise.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Merchandise.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>15) Fix mistakes </B>- A listing can be a mixture of great marketing ideas and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mistakes at the same time. Randy uses the auctions to promote an enormous</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>amount of products from Instant Chai Tea Mix to Pumpkin Spice Flavored</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Coffee to Chocolate Dipped Biscotti. The entire list extends to six pages!...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Pepper.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Pepper.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Randy does several things right…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>His Web site is pleasant and he includes information about all his products.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>His auction prices are lower than those on his Web site which encourages</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers to buy from the auctions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>He is shrewd about shipping, too. Shipping for one item or five items is $6</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>which encourages buying more, of course. Another plus? The prices for these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>kinds of items are very good.</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Distributers.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Distributers.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>He will send a printed catalog through the mail - an added bonus and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more publicity for him.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Randy should fix the following...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>He includes a section on his Web site called “Special Offers.” Clicking on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that listing, however, leads to an empty page (at the time of writing this book).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Either he should promote some specially priced items, or remove that section</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from his site entirely. An empty page is a big turn-off for a customer.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>The “Newsletter” listed on his site consists of several paragraphs about the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>owners and their store. It isn’t really a newsletter because it doesn’t change.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is nowhere to sign up for periodic updates about their products or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information about items in the store. There are two features called “Coffee</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Facts” and “Perfect Cup” which are brief information pages on coffee and how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to brew a great cup. He needs to expand on this with more coffee trivia and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tips.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>His request for distributors is a good idea but misspelling the word detracts</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from his credibility...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>He writes all his listings on a black background which makes them harder</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to read. Text on black background isn’t effective. You want to <B>attract </B>not repel</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>those surfing eyeballs of your visitors.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s a good thing to “fix” things once you identify them. However, the best way</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to be successful is by avoiding mistakes in the first place as you will see next...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Skip These Mistakes</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It isn’t comfortable to single out sellers and point out their mistakes. But you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to know what <B>not </B>to do to maximize auction income. Sometimes, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most awful listings are swamped with bids - just because the deal is so good.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Nevertheless, the more professional you are, the better you will play the game.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Making careless and pointless errors isn’t very productive.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) There are three errors in one section </B>- This person was auctioning</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>knives and had the following at the bottom of his listing...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=ClickBelow.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/ClickBelow.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Looks like a good idea, right? The problem was...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>“View My Other Auctions”- he had no other auctions (at this time) so that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>page went nowhere and this made him look foolish.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>“Visit My Homepage” - this was what I found when I clicked that link...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Error.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Error.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>As for his e-mail address, I sent him two e-mails and he never responded to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>either. Always answer your e-mail!</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=PetTreats.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/PetTreats.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Your visitor is only a click away from leaving </B>- My surfing started</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with this listing…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There were no pictures of these treats so I decided to follow the link to “Country</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Treasures,” as directed on the listing. The link led me to this page…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=PetStuff.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/PetStuff.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This was all the information on the page about pets. The rest of the page was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about other items that were not related to pets in any way. It was also covered</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with the symbol for broken links for pictures. Further more, irritating “pop up</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>windows” appeared frequently, windows that were ads soliciting my money for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all kinds of stuff that I wasn’t interested in - opportunities that had nothing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whatsoever to do with pets.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The next page brought me to...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=HomeMade.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/HomeMade.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Notice the misspelled word. And still no pictures or details about the treats.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, I tried one more time. My next “click” took me to a totally blank</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>screen. Not even an error message!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I know you won’t be surprised to hear that I didn’t buy any of her pet treats.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Would the average buyer have followed all the way through to the fourth link?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Not likely.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Pictures often make the difference between a sale and no-sale </B>-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>- For some categories, pictures are an absolute “must.” With this listing...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Earrings.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Earrings.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>... the seller received no bids at all. Jewelry <B>demands </B>pictures. So before</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you list any items at all, think about whether pictures are a necessity. If they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are, provide them.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Always proofread your listing before submission </B>- Here is the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>absolute worst listing I have ever seen. Can you translate it for me?…</FONT>

<P><IMG alt=Torn.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Torn.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This item, whatever it was, listed for $25. You guessed it. The bids didn’t pile</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>up in response to this listing.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Successful Sellers</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>OK. Earlier on we looked at great selling <B>tactics. </B>Now it’s time to observe</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some role models - really professional sellers who are making lots of money</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on auction sites. As I said before, I have found that the quickest way to improve</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>my own auctions is to study what successful people are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you find these folks? When you follow a certain category (or two) for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>while, you will notice that certain names appear repeatedly. Lots of sellers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>jump in, try to sell a few items and are unsuccessful. Or they realize they aren’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>going to become millionaires in a month and move on. The ones who endure,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>however, are the ones who know what they are doing. These sellers are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fantastic role models.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>An important point... <B>there is always more to learn! </B>Even though I have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>been selling on the sites for a long, l-o-n-g time (Internet time, that is), I still</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>observe other sellers constantly, note what they are doing and try to figure out</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how I can use their methods in my own auctions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is especially important to periodically look at other categories. You may have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>no personal interest in civil war weapons or DVDs but it could happen that a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller of those things has a <B>brilliant idea </B>that will make you a pile of money.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Winner #1...</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Our first seller is Alan Probst. Alan, a professional ball player, was looking for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>something to do in the off season. Alan had some leftover bats from baseball</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stars, Jeff Bagwell and Craig Baggio, as well as some catcher’s gloves. He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decided to put them on eBay… and was hooked!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now Alan has auction fever and sells about 10 wholesale products, many of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>which are stored in his garage. He plans to expand as soon as this year’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>baseball season is over.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Alan likes auctions so much that instead of an off season occupation, he now</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spends three hours before the game, and another three hours after, on the Net.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Alan states that success depends upon two factors...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>i) Selling quality products</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>ii) Great customer service</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He insists that your customers must feel safe buying from you. They must feel</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that you are fair.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He prides himself on getting his merchandise out quickly. He tries to schedule</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>his auctions so that they end when he is at home rather than on a road trip.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That way he can be there for his customers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Alan keeps <B>meticulous </B>records. He is very careful about the merchandise his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers receive and he always delivers it promptly.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He refunds people’s money if they ask for it. As an example, he sold some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>diamond earrings for $9.99 that retail for about $35 - $40. He has sold over</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>1,000 pairs, and has refunded only seven or eight customers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Alan sells a lot of merchandise as fundraisers for churches and little league</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>teams.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>Winner #2...</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Richard Duncan has a real “family affair” with eBay because his son and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>daughter also sell on the site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Richard is a friendly retired auto worker who has sold items outside his full-time</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>job for 40 years. Even while working in the auto plants, he sold items like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>jewelry, citizen’s band radios and metal detectors. Given his love of selling, it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>isn’t surprising that Richard, his wife, son and his brother opened a 3,300</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>square foot flea market in his town. They are open every day from 9-5 and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from 12-5 on Sundays.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eBay is Richard’s hobby. He sells mostly new merchandise. One of his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>biggest sellers teaches us a lot about the psychology of buying and selling.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Richard offered some knives for $1.25, with 50 cents for shipping and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>handling...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=ArmyKnife.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/ArmyKnife.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To his dismay, he sold only a handful at this price. However, to get a bargain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>price, he had to buy 600 of these so he had a financial investment that he was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>determined to recoup. So he offered them for <B>one cent </B>with $1.75 shipping</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and handling ($1.25, if 20 or more) and has sold 40,000 of them!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Richard adds that your ads must be written for a particular audience. <B>Flag</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>your target customer. </B>Although some women have bought his knives, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can easily see that it is directed primarily toward a male audience...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=MalePitch.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/MalePitch.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>His only unpleasant situation was when he was contacted by eBay. They</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>complained that they were getting gypped out of their commission since he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>was only charging only one cent for his knives. He successfully argued that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>since he was paying to have his knives “featured,” they were making their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money anyway.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are zillions of items on eBay that sell for a penny. Richard told me that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the auction site only takes notice if somebody complains to them. Most likely it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>was Richard’s competition who did so.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He also says that as soon as he creates a successful ad, somebody copies it - </FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>a frequent comment from super sellers. Richard had a great ad for a clock that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>was copied by many others. My favorite response to imitation is to quote what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Ray Kroc once said - “We can invent faster than people can copy.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Good selling runs in the family. Richard’s son is also a power seller. You can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tell by his ad where he clearly outlines the benefits of his product...</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>Winner #3</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sheri Lehn focuses mainly on software and jewelry. Sheri finds great deals on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>jewelry that she passes along to her customers. And she also sells handmade</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>jewelry.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sheri suggests that you make <B>policy changes as required. </B>In her case,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>she no longer accepts returns. Through experience, she learned that her initial</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>return policy was not effective.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, Sheri advertised two silver tiffany bracelets as containing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>approximately 32 grams of silver. She received an e-mail from a customer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who claimed that the total weight was only 30.7 grams and therefore she</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wanted her money back.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another woman bought a crystal bracelet made with an elastic cord. She</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>claimed that she couldn’t get the bracelet around her wrist but this bracelet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stretched to over 9”! We laughed as we tried to picture in our mind the wrist</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>involved.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>She claims that selling on the auction sites is easy. She started, like almost</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everyone else, by selling goodies out of her house. In all of her many</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>transactions, she has only received two or three bad checks and they were for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>small amounts. Her secret to success is that sellers must know their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise and it really helps a lot if you like the auction business!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Business is slower in the summer but she still does very well. Amazingly, in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spite of all her auction business, she still holds down a full-time job. Her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>husband works with her and gets her sold items in the mail. She spends long</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hours wrapping boxes and replying to numerous e-mails.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>Winners #4</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>J. B. and Karen Young, <B>ShippingSupply.com</B><B>, </B>make their money selling to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>other auction sellers. They sell shipping supplies and auction such items as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bubble mailers, tissue paper, labels, foam peanuts, CD mailers, boxes, tape,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>etc.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In 1997, Karen began as an eBay seller of fine collectibles, glass, pottery, and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>old toys. J. B. was still working full-time and helping in the evenings with such</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chores as packing and taking photos of the items. They had grown to about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>100 items a week when they realized they were spending a lot of their time and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money looking for the packing supplies required to ship their items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They were going through what every auction seller does… dumpster diving for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>boxes and begging at the back door of stores, card shops, or whoever might</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have packing materials . Or as an alternative, they suffered sticker shock when</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they went to the office supply store and paid retail.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They began their present auction business by buying huge master rolls of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bubble wrap. By turning two card tables on their side and using the legs as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spindles, they were able to re-roll the wrap to manageable, shippable sizes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Karen took on a couple of retired folks to help part-time. J. B. continued to help</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>part-time until they got so busy he had to take a leave of absence from his job.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>By the summer of 1998, both Karen and J. B. were both full-time and had</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>increased their personnel.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>All the expert marketers tell us to find a niche and market to that targeted group</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by filling a need. Karen and J.B. have filled a need very well. Their feedback</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>comments from happy clients confirm this.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another smart seller is Wendy Sechel. But it wasn’t so long ago that she was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>really broke and desperate. She was between jobs and realized just how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tough it was when she had to cross a bridge near her home. There was a toll</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of one dollar and Wendy didn’t have it. She was reduced to scrounging on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>floor of her car for those last two cents!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, her financial difficulties were the source of what Wendy considers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>her greatest triumph. In desperation, Wendy took a favorite piece of jewelry to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a pawn shop. The owner offered her $20. Refusing to accept that price, she</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decided to put it on eBay where it sold for $371! Wendy became an instant</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>convert to the power of Internet auctions. She began a new career and has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>never looked back.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wendy says that her first ads were very amateurish-looking - all black text in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one long paragraph. She didn’t even know how to add pictures. Now,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>however, her ads are extremely professional-looking…</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Armani.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Armani.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wendy mainly sells jewelry, air fare certificates and diet products. She</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>constantly has her eyes open for a bargain and is willing to sell any items that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are profitable. When she is asked where she finds the products she sells, her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reply is always the same - networking. <B>Use and develop contacts.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>She is so successful that she receives tons of spam (big surprise). You know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the type - become-a-millionaire-in-two-weeks. Not to worry. She has a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wonderful response. Wendy bundles her ads and sales receipts for two weeks</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and sends it back to the spammer, asking if he would like her help in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money-making department! Needless to say, <B>the spammer is…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… left "spam"-less. </B>Sorry, I couldn’t resist.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When asked her secret to success she states flatly that <B>customer service </B>is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>her answer. Wendy gets approximately 150 e-mails a day, and she answers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them as promptly as possible. She also leaves feedback for every single</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>person she does business with and considering the number of deals she does,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this is a major job.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As for problems, Wendy claims that she needs to be more <B>organized.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Apparently, this isn’t her strong suit.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wendy enjoys dealing with almost all her customers but there are the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>occasional difficult ones. Luckily, she has a sense of humor about those. One</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wacky guy bought a software product that needed to be downloaded. He and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wendy exchanged numerous e-mails. The customer claimed to be both a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>millionaire and a computer expert but was unable to complete a simple</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>download, in spite of step-by-step directions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He then claimed that Wendy had scammed him with a product that was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>defective - even though he knew that many other customers had successfully</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>downloaded the product already. Wendy simply recognizes that there is a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>small minority of goofy folks in every business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wendy joyfully proclaims that she loves the auction business, and it is easy to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hear this in her voice. But Wendy swears that in spite of all the money she is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>making now, she will never forget the lean times when life was tough. She told</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>her mother years ago that if she ever “made it big,” she wouldn’t become a</FONT>
