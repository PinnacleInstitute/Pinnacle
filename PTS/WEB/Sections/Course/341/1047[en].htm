<B><FONT size=4>Shipping and Handling</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The movement of product to your buyer is a demanding process. Your entire</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction business will fall on its face if your merchandise delivery isn’t prompt</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and intact.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eBay claims that between 5 and 10% of all the packages being shipped in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>United States are their auction items! An astounding statistic.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s see how you can add to the volume...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Shipping</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most auction items are shipped through one of three carriers -- the <B>Post</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Office, United Parcel Service </B>and <B>Federal Express.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In spite of all the bad press about the <B>Post Office, </B>it is my personal favorite,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hands down...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>US Post Office</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.usps.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Post Office’s Web site is a treasure trove. You can find zip codes</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(including those extra four-digit numbers which speed up delivery), order</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stamps and see shipping rates to any destination.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One indispensable item for successful auction selling is a <B>postal scale. </B>Mine</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is measured in ounces because I usually deal in small items. Buy a scale that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is flexible enough to meet your needs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Know your shipping charges in advance, have postage affixed to the package</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and just drop it off at the Post Office. Simple and efficient.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Post Office will pick up your Priority Mail packages but there is a fee for this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service. Generally, I send everything by Priority Mail for the protection of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer and myself. Priority Mail <B>tracks </B>your packages. This service allows you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to <B>know where your </B>package is at any time and this information is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>accessible online.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When I was a novice auction buyer, I didn’t include tracking for cheaper items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I was lucky that everything arrived safely. Then I sold a $75 item and later</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>received an accusatory e-mail from my buyer -- “Where is my package?” The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Post Office had tried to deliver it twice. Because no one was home both times,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they couldn’t get the required signature for the insurance. The Post Office was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about to return the package to me. It was a hassle, I didn’t need. Since that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time, I have always charged the buyer an extra 50 cents on every package. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t request permission. It’s just included as part of the transaction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s a good idea to send a message to your buyer to confirm shipment. With my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>initial shipments, I didn’t include the <B>tracking number </B>but followed it up</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>myself. Now I include the number and the exact Web site address so that my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer can follow her own package.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this way, I make the entire procedure more efficient by cutting down on my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time investment. And I make the buyer more comfortable because she can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>verify what I have told her.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Occasionally, I have a customer who is buying something very light and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>doesn’t want to pay for Priority shipping (tracking is only available with Priority</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mail). I am quite willing to oblige him in this but I make it very clear that the risk</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is all his. If the package should get lost in the mail, I will not refund his money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If all my customers understand this up front, there isn’t a problem.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Post Office offers insurance as well. These costs are listed online. I offer it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to my buyers as an option. Some want it and some don’t. However, here’s a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>precaution to take. When you offer insurance to your buyers, <B>save their</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>response e-mail </B>(i.e., yes or no answer) until their package has arrived. So</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>far, (knock on wood) my packages have always arrived safely. In the event that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an uninsured one does not, I have proof that my buyer didn’t want insurance.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Canada Post...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.canadapost.ca</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Canada Post offers three options… Priority Courier, Xpresspost and Regular</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>parcel. All charge extra for tracking and insurance. Canada Post also sells</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stamps and offers a rate calculator online.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>United Parcel Service...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.ups.com</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>UPS supplies are not free. This will add substantial costs to your auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. UPS charges are a little more difficult to figure.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>UPS has a great advantage over the Post Office, however, in <B>size, weight</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>and shape. </B>They will ship up to 150 pounds in one box (the Post Office limit</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is 70 pounds). Their size limits are greater, too, and they will ship weird</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shapes that the Post Office won’t accept. Tracking is free, if you get the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>delivery confirmation .</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be aware that UPS has different charges for regular and high-volume users.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Since you will soon be a high-volume customer, you will qualify for these lower</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fees.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Federal Express...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.fedex.com</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>FedEx was a “johnny-come-lately” in the auction delivery business. They</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>realized that they were missing out on a lot of money in the e-commerce field</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and decided to become serious competitors of the Post Office and UPS.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Other Options...</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Depending on the nature of your sold item, you may have to consider other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>options. Bus Lines meet certain challenges, for instance...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Greyhound Bus Lines</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.greyhound.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are many items that are not suitable for any of the carriers above. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, if you are <B>selling furniture, concrete statues…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… or totem poles, </B>you will have to make special arrangements</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with trucking companies or freight carriers. There are special Web sites, such</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>as <B>iShip </B><B>( http://www.iship.com/ ) </B>that can be very helpful for shipping</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>research information, especially if your item is unique.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>International Shipping...</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are going to ship internationally, you need to consider how you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>deliver your packages. <B>Fed Ex </B>is wonderful for documents but not as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appropriate for our auctions. According to people who are experienced in this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>kind of traffic, UPS is the absolute favorite. It has an extensive list of countries</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to which they will ship.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Handling</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Frankly, “handling” is the one and <B>only part of the auction game that…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… really bugs me. </B>But it must be done and done well.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What you sell influences the degree of difficulty. Selling books, without</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>question, is a whole lot easier than china, computers or dolls.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What’s needed to do the job well?…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Boxes </B>-- Obviously, packing begins with a box but not just any old box. A</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shipping-type box is necessary. If you use a shoe box or some other flimsy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>container, you can be certain your package delivery will be a disaster! So you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to become a box-fanatic like the rest of us. Keep your antennae up. Lots</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of merchants have boxes that you can have for free.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are shipping really fragile items, <B>two boxes </B>are safest. The outer box</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>should be a couple of inches larger than the inner one to allow for extra</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>padding.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Padding for your packages </B>-- Do you need padding? Well, yes and no.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sending a few tough books without padding is much different from sending</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>grandma’s dishes unprotected. The outcome is predictable and it’s not a pretty</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sight. What kind of padding should you use?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Newspaper is my padding of choice because it is cheap and readily available.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, be careful because the ink can rub off on some objects and detract</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from their beauty. Wrap these kinds of items in plastic. Some auction users</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buy shredders and use strips of paper as packaging.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I personally hate those plastic peanuts but lots of people swear by them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, electronics manufacturers say to never pack computer and other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>kinds of equipment with peanuts due to the electricity problem. The Post Office</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>recommends plain popcorn. Don’t forget that little critters might like it, too. Cutup</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cardboard can also be very effective as packing material. It’s just tough to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chop up.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Bubble wrap is the preferred favorite. It cushions objects so well (and popping</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the bubbles is a great stress-reducer). Of course, it costs more than the other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>materials so always look for bargains on this valuable product. Save every</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>scrap you get.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of the following addresses are popular sites for <B>bargain materials...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.cleancarton.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.movewithus.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.adpaq.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.uline.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Padded envelopes are a popular choice because they are so simple -- just</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>insert the whatever and mail. The downside is that they aren’t cheap.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whenever you receive anything in one of these envelopes, save them! (Are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you now thinking about all the envelopes you’ve thrown away in the past?)</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Other supplies </B>-- In addition, you need mailing tape, regular tape,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>scissors, labels and a legible marker. I wrap everything in plastic bags just for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>safety’s sake.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another precaution you might consider is to include an <B>extra label </B>inside the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>package. You don’t want your inventory sitting around one of those ghostly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mail offices. If you reuse a box, cover up the old label or scratch through it with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a marker. I sent a package to a seller that came right back to me. I thought the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new address was quite obvious but apparently the Post Office didn’t.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whatever materials you choose to use, be sure to pack your items <B>securely.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Companies will sometimes contest an insurance claim if they feel you didn’t do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an adequate packing job.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you don’t know how to pack an item, you might get free advice at one of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>local stores or post a question on some of the auction newsgroups. There will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>undoubtedly be an experienced user who will cheerfully share her knowledge</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Want to really shine in your auction business? <B>Here is a...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... gold star idea...</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Create a small <B>“certificate” </B>to send to buyers. The certificate tells them how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>great they are to deal with and that you appreciate their business. It should</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>also ask them to notify you by e-mail when their item arrives safely. And it can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gently remind buyers to give me some positive feedback. (You have already</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>written positive comments about them.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>My certificate insert is half a page in length and is printed on bright pink paper.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>My feedback started skyrocketing after I began sending it. Be creative. Design</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your insert according to your own personality. It adds very little to your cost,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>takes virtually no time to insert while you are packaging , and it increases good</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will drastically. Overall, an insert makes you more <B>memorable.</B></FONT> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unless you are used to shipping many boxes and packages, you may not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>realize how fast these costs can add up. I recommend to anyone and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everyone to find their shipping supplies right on the auctions themselves.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are people who are constantly on these sites, offering packaging</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>material in large quantities or through Dutch auctions. The key is to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>comparison-shop.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you dislike this chore as much as I do, you might think about hiring out this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service. Some of my items go directly from the manufacturer to the customer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That’s the ideal situation. Unfortunately, many don’t. I have hired a lovely lady</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who has four children and needs to be at home. Periodically, I deliver a load of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goodies to her house and she packs and mails them for me. Yeah!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Not only do I <B>escape a dreaded chore...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... but I have my dining room back!</FONT></B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Follow-Up With Your Customer</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After mailing your package, it is important to send your buyer a follow-up email.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=3>Dear Joe,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I received your money order yesterday and therefore mailed</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your package this morning. Your tracking # is 123456789 and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can follow its progress at post office dot com.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It has been a real pleasure doing business with you. I am</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sending some positive feedback for you and would appreciate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you doing the same for me. Please let me know when your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>package arrives.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Thanks for a successful and happy transaction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sydney</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What have you accomplished with this short message?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>You have impressed Joe with your <B>efficiency! </B>“Wow! She got my money</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on Tuesday and mailed my product on Wednesday! I like doing business with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this lady.”</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>By sending the tracking number, you have accomplished two things. First,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Joe knows that you have told the truth and really sent his widget. Secondly,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you have put the <B>responsibility </B>on his shoulders. He can track his own</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>package, thus freeing up your precious time.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>You have provided a third opportunity to get valuable <B>feedback </B>for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yourself. The first time you sent your initial, congratulatory message. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>second time you included it with your package insert. And now for the third</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time you have it in your confirmation e-mail. (If your buyer is a royal pain and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the entire transaction has driven you to the neighborhood bar, forego this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>section.)</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Do you really need the buyers to confirm the arrival of their package? No</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because you will surely hear from them if it doesn’t arrive! And with a tracking</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>number you can follow the progress yourself. The confirmation gives you an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>excuse for further <B>contact.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some people think that this constant harping on follow-up and good customer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service is overkill. Maybe you sold a $10 item. As long as you don’t get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>negative feedback, it doesn’t matter if the exchange is sloppy. However, for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>longterm success, <B>attention to detail </B>is important.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some sellers want to make money on shipping. But be aware that most buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>resent paying more than actual shipping charges and experienced ones may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>avoid your auctions altogether if your costs aren’t reasonable.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unfortunately, there is always a tiny minority of people who are dishonest. If 
<BR>you know how, it isn’t hard to protect yourself from these sleazy people. 
<BR>&nbsp;Ready to find out how? Let’s go...</FONT>
