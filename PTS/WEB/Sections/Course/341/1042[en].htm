<B><FONT size=4>Begin by Buying</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To become a <B>master </B>auction player, you must start by buying something.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Why? Simple. You can’t sell <B>effectively </B>if you have never bought. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, when I find a new supplier, I never auction their merchandise until I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have ordered at least one item from them. If their service is awful, or their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise is not what I expected, I want to know it. I need to know this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>before I go out and sell it and have a bunch of angry customers attacking me.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The auction sites have internal Search Engines which make it easy to find</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anything that interest you. The first place to start on any site is to look at their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>categories. If you go to <B>eBay’s </B>home page, the first thing you will notice is the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>category list...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>eBay</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.ebay.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Within those broad categories, however, there are incredible varieties of subcategories</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(and sub-sub-categories). Suddenly, hundreds of possibilities</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enter your mind. I don’t see how it’s possible for anyone not to find something</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to interest them. There really is something for almost everyone on auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sites.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How can you find something you might want to buy? You can search not only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in a particular auction site but over <B>all </B>auction sites as well. Let’s start with the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most immediate source...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) Individual Auction Sites</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To locate an item, you simply click on the <B>Search button </B>and enter the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>keyword(s). On eBay, you can save the search results and you will be notified</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about this request for thirty days.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These engines are simple to use and mostly effective. There are five basic</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ways to search for an item…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) By title </B>- this means a subject name. For example, type in “1800 pocket</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>watch” or “Record album, Three Dog Night.” One problem that hampers buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in their search is some sellers’ very creative spelling habits. Another is the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>kind of foolish titles that some sellers indulge in like... “LQQK OLD</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>RECORD!!!!!!!!!”</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) By item number </B>- this is a more limited search method because you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>must already know something about the item to have its number.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) By seller </B>- lots of serious auction sellers use this search method to keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>themselves informed about their “competition.” Personally, I think there is so</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much opportunity in the auction business that there is very little reason to be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concerned about what others are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) By the bidder </B>- this can be a very powerful way to learn your niche. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you discover someone in your field who really knows her stuff, you might want</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to follow her around for a while and see what she’s doing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>v) By checking past auctions </B>- this is a great research tool because you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can see the price on similar items and you can check the number of items that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have shown up recently. This is the most accurate type of <B>supply and</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>demand </B>information. Some bidders are such fierce collectors that they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>compete with rivals. They constantly check up on each other to make sure they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>aren’t overlooking any special treasures.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) Multiple Auction Sites</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are some amazing electronic creatures called <B>“Bots” </B>(Robots).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ShopBots and AuctionBots will search an item for you. Their biggest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advantage is that they aren’t limited to only one site. You simply type in what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you are looking for, and they will go to many different sites to find what you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seeking.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of the best known AuctionBots are...</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“Seek and ye shall find” rings true in the Net auction world.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Carry Out Due Diligence</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Major news bulletin... Rushing out to buy something without knowing what you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are doing is not smart business! If you are investing in a five dollar book,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>simply to get a feel for the auction process, it’s no big deal. But it is still</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>important to follow <B>due diligence.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once you learn the process, not only will you not make serious buying errors</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(or not as many), you will also learn how to be a more powerful seller. Here</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are the key elements…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Item Description </B>- Obviously it is the buyer’s responsibility to know what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>he is buying. If you have any questions, ask, ask, ask!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Item Condition </B>- There are “grades,” which refer to condition. These are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>well established in professional circles and are used in some descriptions of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction items. The grades are...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>Mint or MIB (for Mint-in-Box) - this is a never-used item, still in its original</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>container, complete with directions. In other words, perfect.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Near mint - the item is perfect but it no longer has the original packaging or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the packaging is less than perfect.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Excellent - has some minor wear but is very close to perfect.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>Very good - has minor defects</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>v) </B>Good - looks used, with defects</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>vi) </B>Poor - is barely collectible at all, heavy damage, heavy use</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be forewarned! Most people tend to <B>overestimate </B>the value of their goods.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This isn’t necessarily because they are liars or they intend to deceive (although</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some sellers are dishonest). It’s just that the items involved are “treasures” and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it’s tough to be objective. So find out... Is the item new or used? If new, does it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have its original packaging? Its warranty? Directions? If used, what is its</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>condition in terms of scratches, missing parts, faded paint? If applicable, is it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>genuine, or a reproduction? Who is the maker?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Transaction Terms </B>- You need to know the details of the transaction...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>What is the seller’s refund policy if the item is damaged?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>How long will it take to get your purchase?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>What are your payment options?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>Who pays for shipping (almost always the buyer).</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>v) </B>Who pays for insurance, if any?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Seller profile </B>- The most important thing you can do is to know who you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are buying from. eBay, for example, has an elaborate system of seller</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>feedback.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Good feedback is absolutely critical to successful selling! You can see that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your entire history as a seller is displayed for all to see. This method keeps</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people honest, and prevents sleazy people from harming buyers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyers have three choices for feedback... <B>negative, positive or neutral.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Any buyer wishing to give negative feedback must have a transaction number,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or he cannot give feedback. This is a way of protecting sellers from spiteful</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you move into the seller’s role, remember... if you want to receive</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(positive) feedback, you need to <B>give it! </B>The feedback mechanism, however,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is not always clear. There are sometimes a lot of very confusing directions for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>finding your buyer or seller to give feedback. For example, you might be asked</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for the ID or the auction number of the transaction you are seeking. It might</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have been weeks since the auction was completed and you can’t easily</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>access this information.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Solution? To locate someone on eBay, click on “Services” link and then the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>link to the Feedback Forum. Once you are there, click on the “Leave feedback</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about...” link.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Type in your ID and password and click “Find all transactions in the past 60</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>days,” and the site will take you to your own auctions. There you will find a list</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of everyone you have done business with in the past two months. Smooth,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>easy, beautiful. You don’t have to remember any password or ID but your own.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Guaranteed! I wasted lots of time trying to find other folks’ IDs until I discovered</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this simple method!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We have probably all had <B>dealings with...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... “The Customer from Hell” at some time or other.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What if a buyer unfairly maligns you? First of all, she can only give you one</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>negative point, although she can load up your feedback with unflattering</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>comments. Secondly, the seller always has a chance to reply.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As a buyer, you have the responsibility to use feedback fairly. If you don’t, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may be on the receiving end of some pretty tough criticism when you are in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller’s role. So...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>Wait until the transaction is complete before you comment. Don’t be too</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hasty to give negative feedback (there are only specific circumstances where</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>feedback can be withdrawn).</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>You can’t leave feedback for yourself.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Don’t ever threaten others with feedback. That’s a quick way to get thrown</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>off the site.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Value assessment </B>- Before you bid on anything, do your best to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>understand the value of what you are buying. Of course, value is truly in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eye of the beholder. But there are ways to <B>educate </B>yourself. eBay offers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information on several categories. It’s free and fairly accurate. If eBay doesn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know, who does?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These articles are just one way to obtain information. There are countless</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>books, magazines and Internet information about all kinds of subjects.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are bidding on an item, it must be because you are interested in this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>area. To become a successful auction player, you must be knowledgeable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about your particular interest. So use every available resource at your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>disposal.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are two <B>cautionary flags, </B>however…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>All experts are not created equal. In other words, every so-called expert isn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>really. Some people claim to know more than they do, simply because of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ignorance. For others, it’s because they wish to make money at any cost. If in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>doubt, never take the advice of only one person.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most of the more experienced auction dealers agree that the “price guides” that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are so common in bookstores may not be very reliable. Just because a guide</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>says your 1959 Elvis record is worth $1500, don’t expect to get that much</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money for it if you decide to auction it. Of course, maybe you’ll get much more.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyers often make errors. A good place to do background research is at…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://pages.ebay.com/community/library/ebay/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Financial limits </B>- I can’t emphasize this enough... Don’t get the <B>wrong</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>type of auction fever! </B>Set your limit and stick to it unless there is an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>absolutely compelling and rational reason for doing otherwise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The most famous example I know is a gentleman who bid over $100,000 on an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>item. Fortunately for him, the sellers were gracious and the item sold for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more reasonable $11,000.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Contact the Seller</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What if you have questions that aren’t answered by the item description?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Always contact the seller if you don’t totally understand what you are getting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>into. Whenever you see an item for sale, you will also see a phrase that says</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“ask seller a question.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is the buyer’s responsibility to be very clear.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What if your bid wins an item and you discover that it’s something you don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>like? Unfortunately, you didn’t ask any questions before you bid so it’s tough</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>luck. You didn’t do your homework and now you have to live with the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consequences.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The point of this chapter is to understand the buyer’s experience, not to just get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you to spend some money. Find a low-priced item to buy so that it doesn’t cost</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you much for your “education.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The important point here is to <B>analyze the buying process </B>to see what you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to do in order to be an <B>effective seller.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Review of all the categories on a general site, like eBay, unless you already</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are passionate about something and plan to specialize in this. It won’t take</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that long because you will be able to dismiss most of the categories without</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>even thinking about it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t spend hours doing this. Just take a quick survey. Keep an open mind.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you take the time to do this exercise, you will know more about successful</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling than most people who have been auctioning for years. Most people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t bother with this step. They just use the “hit-and-miss” method.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most people fail in any business because they don’t plan adequately. Build a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>foundation that is solid. A hit-and-miss approach leaves cracks that in time</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>weaken your business. Take the time now to do the necessary prep work. And</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>then there will be nothing to repair later on. Ken Evoy ( <B>SiteSell.com </B>) often</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>quotes Benjamin Franklin... “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now let’s bid on your first item. It’s the best way to learn how to be a competent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>super-achieving seller and make the kind of profit margins your heart desires...</FONT>
