<B><FONT size=4>Sell Goods You Don’t Own</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Generally the sellers highlighted in Chapters 15 and 16 followed the business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>model of high volume/low price. With that particular approach, the seller must</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell large quantity of items to make a substantial income.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This chapter is about the <B>low volume seller, </B>the one who specializes in very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive items. That does not necessarily mean, however, that those</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>thousands of dollars invested in merchandise are coming out of your pocket as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the seller. The safest way to sell high-end items is to sell merchandise that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>belongs to other people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Certainly, if you find something that you recognize as an awesome bargain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and you are an experienced trader, then go for it and buy the expensive item</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with your own money. But that is a long way off for the smart auction seller.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Never, never, <B>never </B>do this until you are experienced, very <B>experienced!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some people think that Net auction sales are strictly for small ticket items and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>there isn’t much money to be made unless you are a volume dealer. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chapter will get rid of that notion. Net auctions are vast in scope. There is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(almost) something for everybody.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is a 4 bedroom yacht for sale to the highest bidder…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I am including a bit of its listing description…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=3>...witnessed some of America’s most historic events,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>including FDR and Eisenhower planning D Day, Truman</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pondering whether to drop the nuclear bomb, Nixon</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>negotiating the first arms control treaty with the Soviet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Union and later deciding to resign and Kennedy celebrating</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>his last birthday party (just after Marilyn Monroe sang to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>him at Carnegie Hall).</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This was a sealed bid auction so we know nothing about the sale price, except</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that the winner had to pay a $100,000 deposit within 24 hours.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Or, imagine bidding over a million dollars on a house based on a listing…</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=House.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/House.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The sale of yachts and million dollar houses obviously produces generous</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>commissions. For more income-boosting possibilities, read on...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Vehicles</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s true! If you love cars, motorcycles, trucks, SUVs and RVs, you can make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lots of money selling these vehicles for others. Why would anyone want your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services? Consider these situations...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The seller lives in a very small town with a limited market. If you live in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Eustace, Texas which has a population of 350, the market for that Ferrari may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be rather limited.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The seller isn’t online and never will be. Therefore, they don’t know about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Internet auctions or the other car sites.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The owner inherited the car when his parents died. The vehicle is in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Oklahoma and the heir is in New York.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>There are personal reasons. One truck owner was so furious at the only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Ford dealer in town that he said he would set his Pick-up on fire before he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would let them have it! Or there are people who have no strategy other than to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>put their cars in the paper and cross their fingers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The question is how do you find these vehicles? Obviously, you don’t want to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>talk to the dealers. You are interested in individuals, not professionals. So</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>take your detective skills and search...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Newspapers and Specialty Magazines </B>-  Be a regular subscriber to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all your local newspapers. The specialty papers are even better, like the “Auto</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Trader” or the “Advertiser” magazines in your area. Many of the ads in these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>publications are from dealers but many are private individuals and those are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the kind that you want. Create a master list and follow up with these folks.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, you see a new Ferrari ad in the Advertiser. Don’t bother calling a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new ad because sellers are in a state of glowing optimism when they first</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>begin an ad. They expect the phone to ring night and day. Three weeks or a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>month later, however, their attitude will be different if the car hasn’t sold. All</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you need to do is call the owner and ask politely if the car has been purchased.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If it hasn’t sold, it’s negotiation time.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Rule of thumb -  always, always pursue a lead. </B>Even if the owner</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>doesn’t want your help now, he may change his tune in another few weeks.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Persistence </B>is the key to success.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many people don’t trust the professionals, especially car dealers. They fear</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they are about to be scammed. If you come across as “good ole Joe,” you may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>get more business than you can handle.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Your own locale </B>-  The second best approach is to pay attention as you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>drive around. Private citizens park cars in mall parking lots, on busy streets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and all kinds of public and private spots with “For Sale By Owner” signs on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them. These are often fabulous deals.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I always have a small tape recorder in my car. In this way, when I see</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>something that seems promising, I can make sure I have the number. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>backs of napkins don’t work as well. In addition, ideas and notions seem to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strike at very inconvenient times -  like when I am driving down the expressway</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in rush hour.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Car auctions </B>-  In our area, there is a weekly car auction that is available</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to the general public. Most car auctions are reserved for licensed dealers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Consider becoming one.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Organizations </B>-  Most people are members of particular organizations.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Take advantage of this by letting people know what you do. Use the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>newsletters, bulletin boards or even company events to let folks know that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have a sideline, or a full time, business disposing of unwanted vehicles. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>isn’t nearly as quick or direct as calling people but it is often easier because of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your good reputation. That is if you have one, of course!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Ads </B>-  You can put your own ads in papers and magazines or on your Web</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site to let prospective sellers know what you do. The effectiveness of this may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>depend on where you live and the economic conditions of your area.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One enterprising person in my city has printed signs advertising that he buys</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cars for cash, on the spot. He puts them on telephone poles and in vacant</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lots. (Before you do this, check the sign ordinances where you live. It is illegal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in our area but people do it anyway. A big fine is not worth it.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So what kind of vehicles should you look for? Don’t bother with cheap ones.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There isn’t enough profit.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Set your sight line...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... straight at expensive cars. </B>Look at this auction listing...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Ferrari.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Ferrari.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Amazing, isn’t it? 37 people bid this much money for a vehicle they have not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>even seen!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you deal with the owners? When you call the owner of a vehicle, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to convince him that you are the <B>answer </B>to his problem -  i.e., you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dispose of his unwanted property.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But before you call, you had better have a strategy in mind. The question he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will be asking himself is... “What’s in it for me?” If you don’t have a clear and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>persuasive answer, you won’t be auctioning his property.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your strategy might involve...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) An Option </B>-  An option is simply the <B>right but not the obligation </B>to buy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at a certain price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you know a car is worth $50,000 and the owner is willing to sell for $38,000,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargain for an option for $36,000. You may not get it but you can try. Even at</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$38,000 it may be a good deal. Then simply auction the car for $39,000 or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$39,500 or whatever profit you wish to make.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The great thing about options is that if the car doesn’t sell, you are under no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>legal obligation whatsoever. In addition, set up your option for a relatively</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>short duration. You will quickly know if you are going to get your price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is a sample option agreement. The laws of every state and province are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>different so if you are going to use an option agreement, check with an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>attorney.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is a sample only. It is not meant as legal advice in any way...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B>

<BR><FONT size=3>State/Province of _________________, County/City of __________________</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I ________________________________ a Notary Public of the location</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>aforesaid, certify that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>____________________________________</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>personally appeared before me this day and acknowledge the execution of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>foregoing instrument. Witness my hand and official stamp or seal, this ____</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>day of _________, 20___.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>My commission expires: _______________</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>_______________________________, Notary Public.</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Optionor is the seller. The Optionee is you, the auction master.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most, if not all, localities require that actual money be exchanged in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>execution of an auction. I commonly give a seller $1, just to make it a binding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agreement.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) A Commission </B>-  You offer to sell a vehicle for a pre-determined</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>commission. A commission of 5% to 10% is common. I would not do any work</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to sell a vehicle unless I had our agreement in writing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Higher Price </B>-  You can choose to raise the price of the vehicle. If the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>present owner will accept $15,000, begin the auction at $15,500.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are auction sellers who are very secretive with the owner. You may not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to disclose your actual profit but I believe that it is best to be very open</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about what you are doing. After all, the owner cannot realistically expect you to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>work for free. Whenever you deal with an owner, point out to him that you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>risking your time and expertise. If he doesn’t get paid, you don’t either. In</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>short, he has everything to gain -  a sold car or truck.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What’s the insertion fee payment to list your ad? It varies. There is usually a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sale fee as well but that’s not a problem. The sale money will more than</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>compensate for this charge. The insertion fee, however, could be a loss out of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your pocket if the car doesn’t sell. Are you going to assume the risk or is the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller going to give you this fee?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That is a judgment call for each individual. If I were selling cars, I would let it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be a case-by-case issue. If the deal was really great, and I felt confident, I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would assume the risk rather than lose the deal. If it is marginal, I probably</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wouldn’t.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you learn the transportation business? Personally, all I know about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cars is that I like to drive a nice one. However, I know some people in this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business and they have recommended the following sources...</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>I think we can safely assume that there is money to be made in toys. But look</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at that “cool.” It’s <B>too </B>cool!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Real Estate</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you find it hard to believe that someone would sell her house on an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I was like that at first until a friend commented that a listing on eBay was a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whole lot cheaper than an ad in the Robb Report...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Farm.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Farm.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Individuals also sell their business real estate on the auction sites. Take a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gander at this example -  a storage facility that sold for $565,000...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Storage.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Storage.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Can you make money if you sell this kind of property for someone? Obviously,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can. Thousands of dollars.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you have to be a real estate agent? Absolutely not. You can handle this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>transaction in exactly the way cars are handled.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Timeshares</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Timeshares are a great “commodity” to auction. Recently, I spoke with a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>student who wanted to go to Italy but couldn’t find an Italian willing to make a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>direct trade. So he rented his timeshare and went to Italy on the proceeds.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Timeshares sell well on Net auctions...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=TimeShare.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/TimeShare.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This particular listing includes all the information about an entire project and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sends buyers to the seller’s Web site. As you can see, he is promoting his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business with eBay.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now for a slight twist...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=StThomas.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/StThomas.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<P><IMG alt=Modest.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Modest.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You will notice that the person listing this timeshare is referring to the seller as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>another person. Our auction seller is not the owner and is handling the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>transaction for someone else.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Industrial Equipment</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are all kinds of industrial equipment for sale on auction sites. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, here is an item that could result in a commission of 5 – 10% if you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>were the seller...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Crane.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Crane.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are interested in these kinds of transactions, where can you find</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>equipment to auction without having to buy it yourself? Well, remember these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>possibilities...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) The Thomas Register</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.thomasregister.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The wonderful Thomas Register offers all kinds of opportunity to anyone</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interested in anything industrial. The Register is gruesomely expensive but is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>worth its weight in gold. Most likely a library near you that has a copy. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have any interest whatsoever in selling expensive products that don’t belong to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you, you need to become familiar with this wonderful source.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The print version has 47,144 pages of products and services in 23 volumes,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>three volumes of company profiles and seven volumes of catalogs from its</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>listed members. Or you can get a free membership and use their online</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here’s how to use the Thomas Register. Suppose you are interested in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>backhoes. This seller has one for sale on eBay for $11,900...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you check the Thomas Register, you will find that there are large</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>numbers of companies that deal with backhoes. You can contact all of those</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>companies and offer to help them to either dispose of inventory they no longer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want, or locate equipment they are seeking. You accept a commission for this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service and the company doesn’t have to pay you if you don’t sell their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>equipment.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you sold the backhoe pictured above, you would make either $595 or $1190</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(based on a 5 - 10% commission). Do a couple of such deals a week and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>create a nice income for yourself. You have no money in merchandise and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your only risk is the $3.10 for an ad on eBay. It’s even less on other sites.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Become A Manufacturer’s Representative </B>-  There are large</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>numbers of “manufacturer’s reps.” These are people who attempt to sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products for one or more companies that they represent. Some reps already</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know about Internet auctions but many do not.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Make the acquaintance of some of these folks and offer to help them sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain items that stump them. In fact, I know two sellers who have become</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reps themselves and use the auctions for a large part of their inventory.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The following items have all been sold at auctions by either manufacturer’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reps or by auction sellers who work with them... Appliances, Furniture, Building</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>supplies and material, Windows, Heavy garden and lawn statues, Bicycles,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Camping equipment, Exercise and gym equipment, Sporting goods, Spas, hot</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tubs, Stereo, CD, cassette decks, VCRs, TVs and Vending machines</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you decide you might like to try your hand at this, here are some helpful</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>resources...</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>3) Manufacturers Representatives of America</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.mra-reps.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The <B>MRA </B>is an excellent online resource. It is a non-profit organization for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>both manufacturers and representatives.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Trade Magazines and Newspapers </B>- This kind of media is a rich</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>source of expensive equipment. For example, I have on my desk a trade</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>newspaper for the dry cleaning industry with a wide assortment of equipment</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for sale.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most of them are perfect for auctioneers because they are small companies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that are either going out of business and need to unload their machinery or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they are expanding and have bought new equipment.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These listings and prices illustrate the point...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">i) </FONT></B>“Bowe/Permac K-25 55 pound hydrocarbon dry-cleaning machines; never 
<BR>used; still in original wrap. Must sell. Without still is $44,000; 
<BR>with still is $72,000. OBO. Will pay shipping.” (Does this sound 
<BR>like a motivated seller?) 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">ii) </FONT></B>Used plant equipment - 13 lines listing various equipment. The ad 
<BR>states OBO. Will negotiate. 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">iii) </FONT></B>Unipress shirt cleaner for $17,000. Also dry-cleaning and 
<BR>laundry presses, washers, dryers, air compressors, heat reclaimer 
<BR>systems, water softener and more. “Owner retiring for health reasons.”</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>More High-End Possibilities</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are lots of other possibilities for sales. Once you actively start looking,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you’ll be surprised at what opportunities present themselves. For example,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>restaurant equipment...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Pizza.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Pizza.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Or medical equipment ...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=X-Ray.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/X-Ray.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Then there are all the other expensive items that folks may need to sell such as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>jewelry, antiques, art, furs or expensive furniture. This $18,000 bracelet would</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certainly get the blood pumping...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Bracelet.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Bracelet.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Include the following in your search for miscellaneous items...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Local specialty magazines </B>-  We already discussed magazines such</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>as the “Trader” and “Advertiser,” and pointed out that they are great places to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buy merchandise at bargain prices. However, they are also superb if you want</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to find expensive merchandise to sell for other people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Atlanta “Advertiser” recently had multiple items in the following</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>categories... Medical equipment, Farm equipment, Office and business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>equipment, Office furniture, Businesses for sale and Jewelry of all kinds.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Often the sellers in these magazines are in a tight spot and need to get rid of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the merchandise. I read one once that said, “Assume notes on heavy duty</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>trailer (+$1000).” Another deal in this same paper offered a $23,000 mobile</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>home for $12,995. Someone snatched up that deal the first day the magazine</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appeared.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be creative. Make money from these magazines by turning the situation</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>around. <B>Find objects, rather than sell them.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is a gentleman who collects Lionel trains and has an ad in every issue of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the magazine. Whenever I see these trains on auction sites, I send him a fax,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>asking if he is interested, and what he is willing to pay for them. I then keep my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bid below what he is willing to pay so that I can make a profit. For example, if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone is willing to pay $200 for an object and you want to make $40 in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profit, don’t bid above $160.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What if I win the bid, and my buyer doesn’t follow through with the money? In</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that case, I am faced with two choices...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>I renege on my bid (which I would never do.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>I am “stuck” with the item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Understand something about the merchandise before you bid. I have a Lionel</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>train book in my house, supplied by my buyer. I can check prices and know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>approximately what something is worth. I’m not going to be stuck with an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>overpriced item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And I would never bid on something really expensive -  unless the money was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>escrowed. I might make an exception if I knew my dealer really well and had</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>done business with him many times.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Rural Newspapers </B>-  Newspapers in very small communities are a great</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>resource. Subscribe to them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are so many items that don’t sell locally because the demand just isn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>large enough. It‘s a great opportunity to offer your selling services and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eliminate the frustration problem.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Estates </B>-  Several years ago I purchased a course on how to buy real</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>estate through probate. A probate is the legal procedure that heirs must often</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>go through to claim property of deceased relatives. Not all wills are probated</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>but many are.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I never did buy any houses this way but I am aware of the gold mine potential.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are students of this business approach who made more money with the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contents of the house than on the property itself. One gentleman founded</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>three pawn shops with this method.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you find probate properties? There are two main ways... The first is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>through a legal newspaper. Every county or province has one, and it is a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>simple matter to find it. If someone probates a will (i.e., it is filed with the court),</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a probate notice must be in the legal papers for a certain period of time. In my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>county, it must be listed for three weeks in a row.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The second and better way is to familiarize yourself with your county or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provincial courthouse. A probate is public record so anyone can access the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>records. By searching the records, you will know about probates before the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>general public who only read about it through the newspapers. You can then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contact the executor who is in charge of the estate and get more details.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is a fantastic method because almost no one knows about it. The few who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>do are looking for property rather than auctionable goods. And it’s surprisingly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time efficient once you get used to the system.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When I first started, I spent lots of hours in the courthouse, understanding the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>system and reading all the probates. But now I can go once a week for thirty to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sixty minutes and harvest the past week’s crop.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The final point about estates involves <B>household content. </B>Follow-up on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>situations where there are no surviving spouses or the heirs live out of town. In</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>these cases, there are usually furnishings that no one wants. You can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>volunteer your kind “removal” services. One person I know even charges the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>heirs for “carting away” the property. I have never had the nerve to take</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advantage of people that way</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another way, although less effective, is to be in contact with local real estate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>investors who aren’t interested in the contents. There can be some incredibly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>valuable items in these estate houses. Conversely, there can also be a lot of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>real junk. There is no way of knowing until you are in the house.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Charity Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Go to <B>http://pages.ebay.com/charity/ </B>and you will see the huge number of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>charity auctions that are on the sites. If you would like to make money this way,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can arrange these auctions -  and handle the details -  for various groups</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who have never considered this idea and don’t have the expertise to handle it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You make your profit by charging a certain <B>percentage </B>of the total revenue.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If this type of auction business appeals to you, specialize in handling auctions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for all kinds of groups. You can stage charity auctions for schools, athletic</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>organizations and church groups, as well as regular charitable causes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here are the steps on eBay for creating a charity auction...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Get approval from eBay for your organization or cause. They also will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>require some information at the time of the auction such as the name of a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contact person, a brief synopsis of your organization and examples of items</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you would like to list.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Create an “About Me” page, explaining your organization and what it does.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The only difference between your auction page and your personal page is that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you should change Feedback to “Show no feedback” and change “Items for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sale” to “Show all items.” eBay further suggests that you may want to include</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your logo for your organization at the top of your About Me page.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Have e-Bay link your listings to the “Charity page” which gets a lot of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>attention.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you wanted to set up and manage charity auctions, what can you sell for an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>organization? First, you can find new merchandise that can be bought for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargain price. You can auction an event or service. You can get gift donations</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from community members or merchants.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another possibility is to convince a company to sponsor your cause. Underline</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the fact that it would provide great publicity for the company. In fact, a lot of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Charity pages are really ads for a particular company.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are really ambitious, you can often find celebrities who will participate by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>donating items, their name or their time. For the past Paralympic games in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Australia, many celebrities contributed art and their contributions were featured</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the front page of eBay Australia.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Visit <B>http://pages.ebay.com/community/charity/success.html </B>for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>success stories involving charities and auction sites.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Charity auctions are a great excuse for a media fest. And, by extension, they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are great <B>publicity opportunities </B>for your auction business. Local media</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>love interesting, colorful local stories and an Internet charity auction is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>definitely different.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Send news releases. Call radio and TV stations. Inquire as to whether or not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anyone else in the group has some media contacts.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, a local business man sponsored an auction of products from his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>company. Some of the products were auctioned on the Internet. Some were</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>done through the local cable TV station when they were sponsoring a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fundraising drive. Most of the volunteers <B>working the phones...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... were his employees, wearing company T-shirts. </B>He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>was interviewed repeatedly, and gave away merchandise to callers pledging</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain amounts. His business increased dramatically as did the traffic to his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web page and auction sites.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Financial Instruments</FONT></B>

<BR><FONT size=3>Amazing though it sounds, there is a lot of business in <B>financial instruments</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>like mortgages, foreclosures, liens and judgements. Check out this example...</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>Excess Inventory</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many retail stores have a problem if they have excess inventory in stock at a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain time of year. When either their fiscal or calendar year ends, they must</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pay taxes on these unsold items. If you can sell this merchandise for them, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are providing an appreciated service.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you find them? One way is to use the <B>Yellow Pages </B>and send</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>letters to stores that sell merchandise in your niche. You can go directly to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stores and talk with the manager or owner. Or you can put ads in trade</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>magazines and newspapers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your main argument is that the stores have nothing to lose -  if you don’t sell, it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>costs them nothing. I have sold both jewelry and books this way. Persist. And</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reap the rewards.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>Represent a Professional</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you know a lot about some particular field, you might be able to carve out a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unique niche by getting to know the professionals in your field who have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive merchandise to sell. Seth is an example. He makes a great living</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buying, selling and promoting artists and their products that he locates through</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“starving artists sales.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you live in or near a city of any size, you have most likely have seen the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertisements for these. They are usually listed in the paper and/or are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertised on TV, especially the less expensive cable channels. The sales are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>held in a motel on weekends. <B>There are hundreds of art pieces...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... and dozens of aspiring artists with paintbrush in</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>hand.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most artists, unless they are represented by a gallery or agent, don’t have a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clue about how to sell their art. Act as a <B>manager and promote or sell </B>a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>particular artist’s work online or through the auction sites. And lastly, approach</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>local art galleries to establish a business relationship.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Auction Site Resources</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Auction sites offer different educational resources. For example, Yahoo offers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lots of help. They have a section called “Resources for Your Business.” There</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you will find...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Yahoo! News: Business Full Coverage </B>-  up-to-date business news</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by topics that may be helpful, depending on what you choose to auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of their topics are global economy, electronic commerce and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>international trade.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Yahoo! Industry News </B>-  categories such as Consumer Goods, Finance,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Food, Heavy Industry, High Tech, Light Industry, Medical,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Recreation/Entertainment, Services, and Transportation.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, in the Consumer News category is a section called “Retail.” One</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the stories was titled “Mattel Creates a New Era of Collecting with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Celebration Barbie Series; Celebration Barbie Premiers the New 2000 Holiday</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Collector Series.” If you are a Barbie collector and seller, you will have a head</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>start over your competition.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Further, all the sources of their stories have live links conveniently located right</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by the descriptions so if you are interested you can simply click your mouse</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and read the entire article.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Yahoo! Broadcast: Business </B>provides live events from the worlds of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business and finance. This section has a ton of resources including Yahoo</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>radio.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Yahoo! Clubs: Business and Finance </B>is a section which Yahoo calls</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“public and private online communities for business people.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are all kinds of newsgroups and chat rooms in this section. If you have a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>deep interest in some kind of collectible, for example, you may be able to find</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some customers and some fellow fanatics.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Yahoo! Directory: Business and Finance </B>has a huge list of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>commercial web sites and organizations. This may or may not be helpful,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>depending on what you wish to auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>No matter what type of business you own or do, <B>targeted traffic </B>is critical to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your long term success. Only interested buyers bid. Untargeted visitors either</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ignore what you have to offer or they just browse. Neither activity produces</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>income </B>for you. You need to promote your business effectively.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>Site Build It! ( http://auctions.sitesell.com/ ) </B>will help you build a Web site 
<BR>that will pull in targeted traffic and, at the same time, “warm up” (i.e., PREsell) 
<BR>your visitors. The <B>SBI! </B>process will show you how to create an open-to-buy 
<BR>mindset in your visitors. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Once you achieve that all-important trust level, you are well on your way to a 
<BR>sale (whether that’s your auction item, your e-book, a product that yourepresent, or however you are monetizing traffic to your Web site).</FONT></FONT>
