<BR><FONT size=3>To call an Internet auction an “Entrepreneur’s Dream” isn’t poetic license or 
<BR>part of the get-rich-quick rhetoric. Net auctions are the simplest way on this 
<BR>planet for the “little guy” to make money... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>1) Targeted customers are at your doorstep - With an Internet auction, 
<BR>your customers are already there and they come to you! We don’t have to look 
<BR>for customers because the auctions sites have already created a name for 
<BR>themselves, and they continue to attract millions of customers. But more 
<BR>importantly, they are targeted customers. Customers seeking tennis 
<BR>equipment won’t be looking at the coins you have for sale. And isn’t that the 
<BR>way you want it? Why waste time on customers who will never buy? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>In this book, I refer to eBay more often than any other site. eBay is the... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>... Queen of the sites. This is the company that started the auction 
<BR>frenzy, the one that others copy. eBay has more categories and registered 
<BR>users than any other site. Their information is more comprehensive and their 
<BR>services are broader than anyone else’s. However, eBay is not the only royalty 
<BR>in the kingdom. As you will see later on, another site might prove to be more 
<BR>appropriate for your merchandise. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>2) There are no start-up costs - Can you name any other business that 
<BR>has no start up costs? For example, “Entrepreneur” magazine claims that the 
<BR>average franchise costs $70,000! And when you buy your franchise, what do 
<BR>you get with it? Employees, rent, government regulations, incredible 
<BR>paperwork, the constant threat of lawsuits, grinding responsibility and twelve 
<BR>hour days... phew! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>With a Net auction business, you have none of those expenses. All you have 
<BR>to do is register for free and you are now the proud owner of an auction 
<BR>business. What a contrast! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>3) There is no financial risk - Your maximum risk is $3.30. That’s the 
<BR>maximum charge on eBay to list an item for sale. In the event that your item 
<BR>doesn’t sell, that’s all you lose. On many of the sites, there is no charge at all. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>It is wise to begin with merchandise that you already own (or go rob Mom or 
<BR>Grandma’s attic). No merchandise costs. The only exception is when you are 
<BR>selling a car or house. I don’t recommend that anyone begin their business 
<BR>that way but even if you do, your maximum risk is $50. There is a flat charge 
<BR>from eBay of $50 to list a property, with no further fees if it sells. If you wish to 
<BR>sell a vehicle, there is a $25 listing charge and another $25 charge if it sells. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>4) You can start-up in 5 minutes - Just fill out a registration form at 
<BR>the auction site of your choice, and you can begin selling. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>5) All you need is an Internet connection - With other kinds of small or 
<BR>home businessess, you must spend money on advertising. And ads are not 
<BR>cheap. If we think about advertising a product or service on TV or radio, costs 
<BR>escalate dramatically. Contrast that scenario with this one - the price of an 
<BR>Internet connection of $15 – $25 a month whether you are dealing with 5,000 
<BR>or 5,000,000 customers! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>6) You are open for business 24/7 - The Internet is the only place in the 
<BR>world where a small business can be open 24 hours a day, seven days a 
<BR>week. There are large numbers of people who shop when the rest of the world 
<BR>is sleeping. If we are available to these folks, our sales will be much higher. 
<BR>Why? Market researchers tell us that a large percentage of the merchandise 
<BR>that is bought is an impulse buy. If your items are available at your customer’s 
<BR>convenience, rather than yours, your profits will soar. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>7) You can sell to the entire planet - If you are selling in your home 
<BR>town, your buyers are limited to those people in your geographical area. With 
<BR>the Internet, the world is your customer. The typical merchant can expose his 
<BR>wares to more customers on an Internet auction than would see his products in 
<BR>decades in his home town. As The founder of eBay began the site because his 
<BR>girl friend collected Pez holders, and couldn’t find several that she was 
<BR>seeking. He reasoned that with a larger audience, she could find a greater 
<BR>selection. (I guess there weren’t too many Pez fanatics in her neighborhood.) 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>8) Auction sellers can live wherever they please - In common with 
<BR>many other Internet businesses, geography has become irrelevant. For 
<BR>centuries, humans have had to live in cities if they wanted to engage in 
<BR>commerce at an expanded level. With auctions, you can live anywhere you 
<BR>please, as long as you have electricity. In fact, with laptops we don’t even 
<BR>need to be home. Want to run your auction business in a Winnebago, on 
<BR>safari, or cruising the Mediterranean? No problem. Wireless access and 
<BR>pager services are available. You can follow your auctions any time, 
<BR>anywhere. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>9) You can make money without leaving home - We never have to 
<BR>leave our homes to make as much money as we want. This has to improve 
<BR>family life in a significant way... want to go to the kids’ Little League games? 
<BR>Have lunch with your spouse several times a week? Work at 3:00 A.M. 
<BR>because you are a total night owl? Or perhaps you are a shut-in, disabled or 
<BR>taking care of aging parents. Doesn’t matter. You can participate in Net 
<BR>auctions without any restrictions. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>10) Your computer is the only employee you need - The computer 
<BR>gives you tremendous power and freedom. Unlike the giant companies, our 
<BR>employee doesn’t need a vacation. It takes no sick leave, and has no family 
<BR>emergencies. In other words, you have a 24 hour, seven-days-a-week loyal 
<BR>servant at your beck and call. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>There are a lot of ads in opportunity magazines claiming that you don’t even 
<BR>need a computer to make money on the Internet. Well... maybe. But if you are 
<BR>serious about making money on the Internet, you truly need your own 
<BR>computer. Going to the library, or paying Kinko’s $12 an hour, is a very shortterm 
<BR>solution.&nbsp; 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A name=test>&nbsp;</A> 
<BR>11) You can choose to be part time or full time - Starting a business 
<BR>and getting it going is a full-time job, and then some, unless you choose to be 
<BR>an auction player. Because the Internet will carry on your business without 
<BR>you, you can keep your full-time job until you are ready to quit - if ever. Some 
<BR>folks choose to remain at a part-time level. This removes the terrifying risk of 
<BR>having to give up the economic security of a job until you are well-established. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>12) You can do your market research in advance - Forget about 
<BR>guessing, hoping, praying, lying awake at night, staring at the ceiling and 
<BR>wondering if you are doing the right thing. With this business, it is possible to 
<BR>do your market research in advance and have a very clear picture of how well 
<BR>your product will sell before you even auction it. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>13) Auctions are simple to learn - Net auctions have a mercifully short 
<BR>learning curve. Notice that I didn’t say “no” learning curve. But rest assured 
<BR>that it doesn’t take long to begin playing like a champion. Net auctions are not 
<BR>like brain surgery, law school or quantum physics. To become a superior 
<BR>auction seller, it just takes some observation, attention and time. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>14) There are no feelings of rejection - Some people would rather be 
<BR>boiled in oil than try to sell anything because they are afraid of rejection. That 
<BR>will never happen on an Internet auction. The worst result is disappointment 
<BR>that your item didn’t sell. With Net auctions, the transaction is impersonal and 
<BR>no one will see you. The element of fear is totally absent. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>15) You will make lots of new friends - It’s very satisfying to talk with 
<BR>people who share common interests with you. With Internet auctions, you will 
<BR>get to meet many kindred spirits. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>16) You can automatically become an expert - Once you learn the 
<BR>field, it’s easy to become known as an expert. This is knowledge which may 
<BR>pay off in other ways. For example, a friend who sells jewelry on eBay recently 
<BR>had the opportunity to buy a large amount of it from the estate of an elderly 
<BR>woman. She sold the entire amount to a local jeweler before she could even 
<BR>get in on the auction site. She made $7,000+ in profit. She was then was 
<BR>asked to share her expertise at store level - for a fee, of course. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Right now, there are millions of people involved in Net auctions and traffic 
<BR>continues to increase dramatically. Why? Well, there as many reasons as 
<BR>there are customers... but the key ones are shopping convenience, bargain 
<BR>prices, safety/security (no need to leave home!), and entertainment. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>If you have been an entrepreneur for a while, you may have had the heartbreaking 
<BR>experience of pouring your energy and money into creating a 
<BR>successful business... and then have it fall apart for reasons that are not your 
<BR>fault. That’s happened to me, and it’s a pretty sad experience. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Will that happen with your auction business? Will you create a successful 
<BR>system, make piles of money and have it disintegrate? Definitely not! Your 
<BR>“dream business” is yours for the taking. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Doing business online successfully is really not complicated... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>1) Deliver good products or services that people need or want. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>2) PREsell by “warming up” your visitors so that they trust you and then sell. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>3) Attract targeted traffic cost-effectively.
