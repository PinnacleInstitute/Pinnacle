<B><FONT size=4>Critical Marketing Skills</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Think of your <B>auction listing </B>as your “Web site” and your sales copy is your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web site salesperson. A successful salesperson knows how to “read” her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customer... how to put herself into the mind of her buyer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>By doing so, she is able to discover what her buyer really wants -- and then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provide it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In order to succeed in auctions, you have to do the same thing. Know what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your customer wants and then speak to him or her on a one-to-one level. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are thinking that you can’t do this, I can assure you that it isn’t that difficult.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The simplest, easiest method to figure out what your customers want is to</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>constantly study winning and losing auctions!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Often two sellers will offer identical or almost-identical products, but one will be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a smashing success and the other, a dismal failure. Whenever you find such a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>situation, examine the listings carefully to understand the difference.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, I auctioned some cookware, and the results were just OK. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relisted the item with one adjustment to my previous ad -- I put the retail price in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the headline. This time it was a smashing success. Obviously, my buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wanted a bargain.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Where did I get this idea? Simply by studying some successful sellers. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t need to be a marketing genius constantly inventing clever ploys. All you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to do is figure out what other successful people are doing and <B>adapt </B>it to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your own sales, keeping in mind <B>your target customers’ needs and</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>wants. </B>Believe me, when you start becoming a power player, you will be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>noticed by many people… and they will start copying you!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Competition </B>is keen. With millions of available items to bid on, you must</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>capture the <B>attention </B>of buyers if you plan to succeed. And that’s not all. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to be able to answer that all-important question in the buyer’s mind,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“What’s in it for me?”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Distinguish your auction listing from your competitor’s by mastering the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>following marketing skills…</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Get Some Attention!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The most critical “attention-grabber” is the <B>headline or title </B>of your auction 
<BR>listing. You have to grab your customer’s attention and make them <B>want </B>to 
<BR>read more. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Whenever we want anybody to do anything, the first question that comes to 
<BR>their mind is “why?” If we don’t have an answer, we aren’t going to get the 
<BR>response we want. “Because I want you to” just doesn’t cut it and you won’t get 
<BR>the sale. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>One important marketing principle states that “perception is everything.” What 
<BR>practical value does a statement like that have? It tells us that price isn’t really 
<BR>the issue. It’s what a buyer believes about the product and its <B>benefits </B>that 
<BR>matter. She buys, or does not buy, based on this <B>perceived value.</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Not quite convinced? Here are some examples to ponder... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Do you know about those little strips that are worn on the nose to breathe 
<BR>better and prevent snoring? They are also manufactured for horses at $12 
<BR>each for a one-time use. Horse-race owners cheerfully fork over that kind of 
<BR>money because the owners believe that their horses will finish second instead 
<BR>of sixth, if they have their own strips. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>“USA Today” wrote a story about an artist named Christine Merrill who will 
<BR>paint a portrait for you for a mere $12,000. One small detail needs to be 
<BR>added. Ms. Merrill paints portraits of dogs. There are many such artists 
<BR>available. How about a painting of your beloved parakeet for a bargain price 
<BR>of only $7,000? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>A magazine recently ran a story describing how many people will cheerfully 
<BR>spend $50 to go out to dinner but refuse to spend $30 for a bottle of vitamins. If 
<BR>these people were convinced that they would live an extra ten years in perfect 
<BR>health if they bought the vitamins, do you think they would buy? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>If you are able to meet the <B>wants </B>of a customer, you will make the <B>sale. </B>Price 
<BR>is not <B>the </B>deciding factor in most cases. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>It doesn’t matter if you are selling winning tickets for a $100 million lottery at 50 
<BR>cents per ticket if no one knows about it. Advertising people learn immediately 
<BR>that the headline is <B>THE </B>most important element of any ad. And that is what 
<BR>you are doing with your auction listing -- <B>advertising. </B>Your headline or title is 
<BR>a teaser. You want folks to take the time to read about your sale. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>For great role models, pay attention to radio and television teasers. One of my 
<BR>personal favorites was a shrill radio voice announcing frantically... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>... entire continent sinks beneath the waves... 
<BR>... gigantic death tolls... 
<BR>... stay tuned for details at 10:00. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>After waiting with bated breath, I discovered that this story was about a scientist 
<BR>who claimed he found absolute proof of the existence of the lost continent of 
<BR>Atlantis! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Think of the daily newspaper. Most folks scan the headlines as a way of 
<BR>deciding which stories to read. In fact, the majority of the public reads little else 
<BR>when deciding whether or not they are interested in a particular submission. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Marketing experts know that changing the headline of an ad can increase its 
<BR>power exponentially. Many advertising gurus recommend writing at least <B>100</B> 
<BR>headlines for any ad before making a final choice. As auction power players 
<BR>with hundreds of items for sale, we cannot possibly take the time to do this for 
<BR>every item. But we can master the key principles to make listing titles or 
<BR>headlines more powerful. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The very best way to learn to write headlines is to refer to <B>Make Your Words</B> 
<BR><B>Sell!, </B>an e-book co-authored by Joe Robson and Ken... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>Make Your Words Sell!</B> 
<BR><B>http://myws.sitesell.com/</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>There are lots of how-to books on copywriting but this superb e-book teaches 
<BR>you how to become an <B>e-persuader. </B>It shows you how to write effectively on 
<BR>the Net and persuade your potential customers that you can solve their 
<BR>problems. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Joe and Ken reveal a staggering statistic. Up to <B>80% </B>of your readers will only 
<BR>read your opening headline! This is even more true on an auction site where 
<BR>the page is covered with the headlines of your competitors. You have only a 
<BR>second or so to grab the potential customer while her eye is traveling down the 
<BR>list of items for sale. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Do as <B>MYWS! </B>suggests. Spend <B>80% </B>of your time and effort on the headline 
<BR>for an auction listing. How in the world do you write killer headlines? Before 
<BR>you write a word, carefully consider the question that is foremost in your 
<BR>customer’s mind... What’s in it for me? If you have no answer, you have no 
<BR>sale. You have to understand your customer’s <B>mindset.</B> 
<BR>The creators of some of the most famous headlines of all time thoroughly 
<BR>understood this... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>How I Improved My Memory In One Evening 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Is there any adult who wouldn’t love to possess a more powerful memory, 
<BR>especially through a method that is relatively easy? After all, one evening is 
<BR>pretty rapid progress. Here are some more headlines that answer that 
<BR><B>compelling </B>what’s-in-it-for-me question... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>i) Give Me Five Days And I’ll Give 
<BR>You A Magnetic Personality... 
<BR>Let Me Prove It - Free 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>ii) The Deaf Now Hear Whispers 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>iii) This Summer The West Is Yours 
<BR>For As Little As $827 And Up 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>iv) When Lisa Cooper Sold Her Mother’s 
<BR>Jewelry For $12,000, She Made A 
<BR>$4,000 Mistake. VISIT (merchant) 
<BR>AND YOU WON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>If you have an interest in travel, are deaf, have jewelry to sell, etc., wouldn’t you 
<BR>be interested in these headlines?</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>Top 7 Headline Types</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Make Your Words Sell! </B>explains in detail the 7 most successful types of 
<BR>headlines. Examples right off the pages of eBay will illustrate each type... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• Promise a Major Benefit</B> 
<BR>Double Your Computer’s Speed For Only $5.95! 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• Ask a Question</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Whenever we create curiosity, we tempt our customer to read further... 
<BR>Lose 80 Pounds In One Month? Guaranteed? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The question headline isn’t as common on auction sites but there are lots of 
<BR>ways to create curiosity... 
<BR>Lost 85 Lbs - Husband Now Attacks Me - I LOVE IT! 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• Offer a Solution to a Problem</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>This is the pain and gain headline. By offering your customer a solution, she 
<BR>automatically recognizes her problem... 
<BR>Stop Snoring With Snorenz - Saves Marriages!! 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• Give a Warning</B> 
<BR>If You Have A Pre-Schooler, You Need This! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>This headline creates anxiety, and the anxiety grows if the customer doesn’t 
<BR>bother to read more. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• Flag Your Target Customer</B> 
<BR>Build &amp; Repair Computers Like A Pro! 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• Use a Testimonial</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>These kinds of headlines are rare on auction sites except when used for 
<BR>selling work by famous people... 
<BR>Ted Williams personal model signed Bat 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• News Announcement</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>You can find an occasional headline that follows this format on auction sites... 
<BR>You Read About ‘em – Now Get ‘em! STATE QUARTERS 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>We all like to be up-to-date and informed. This type of headline feeds that 
<BR>desire. 
<BR></FONT><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Turn a Limitation into a Plus</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be aware that there is a <B>letter limit </B>for headlines. You don’t have the luxury 
<BR>of writing as you want. On eBay, for example, the title cannot be longer than 
<BR><B>45 letters. </B>Words must be concentrated. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>A key strategy is to make your headline <B>specific. </B>For example, which do you 
<BR>think is better?... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Signed King First Edition - Only 13 in World 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT face="Times New Roman">or...</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Really Cool Book - WOW!! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Not only do you want to provide <B>information</B>, but you also want to <B>qualify</B> 
<BR>your audience. For example, there are many kinds of dolls. If your doll is 
<BR>bisque, and the buyer hates bisque dolls, it is better for her to know it right 
<BR>away. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The following phrases can do wonders for your listing, so use them often (but 
<BR>only if they’re true, of course)... 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Hard-to-find &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rare, very rare 
<BR>Almost new, like new &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only slightly used 
<BR>Old, very old &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One-of-kind 
<BR>Vintage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primitive 
<BR>Unique &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well loved 
<BR>Pristine &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unusual </FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In <B>Make Your Words Sell!, </B>Joe Robson proposes the theory that certain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>words and phrases are imprinted into our subconscious. He suggests that the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>imprint becomes so irresistible that, under certain conditions, we</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>automaticall</B>y respond to those words. Joe calls these words <B>“Automatic</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Response Words” </B>and by using them in your headline or body copy, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can dramatically increase your sales.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Joe provides a “reference list” to get you started. It’s a great resource tool for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your auction business.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://myws.sitesell.com/</FONT></B></FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Bypass the Hazards</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Good copy does not just happen. It takes <B>effort </B>and an <B>awareness </B>of what 
<BR>works and what doesn’t. Here are nine known writing hazards to bypass... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>1) </B>Do not to use all caps, even though many auction sellers do use them. Net 
<BR>users tend to interpret this as screaming or shouting. Basically, it marks you as 
<BR>an amateur. Sometimes it’s more powerful to capitalize just one word. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>2) </B>Make every word count. If you’re listing in the Beanie Baby category, use 
<BR>your 45 spaces to describe which baby it is. There is no need to say “Rare 
<BR>Beanie Baby.” Your customers already know what it is. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>3) </B>Stay away from silly words like Wow! and L@@K! which might indicate to 
<BR>some readers that you have nothing of real value to say. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>4) </B>Always, always check spelling. It is amazing how often misspelled words 
<BR>make it to the headlines. It’s sloppy work and creates a poor impression. How 
<BR>well can a seller know his merchandise if he can’t even spell it correctly. (How 
<BR>did we evre liv without Speel Chek?) 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>5) </B>Avoid the use of well-known brands, if your item has a more obscure name. 
<BR>For example, an infamous headline stated... Croc handbag, NOT Prada, Gucci, 
<BR>Kleinberg-Sherill. Customers may resent this tactic... and an annoyed customer 
<BR>doesn’t buy. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>6) </B>Do not use offensive language. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>7) </B>Be professional. If you only use 36 spaces, avoid the temptation to fill the 
<BR>other nine spaces with all kinds of *#@! symbols because it will annoy 
<BR>people!!!! Right??? 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>8) </B>Be honest. Veteran auction users become annoyed if you make 
<BR>extravagant claims for your item. They will decide for themselves if they can 
<BR>live without it. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>9) </B>Avoid mixing capitals and lower case letters in odd ways. Too bad no one 
<BR>mentioned this to this seller, who is very fond of writing her headlines this way. 
<BR>Decide for yourself if the headline is harder to read than the regular way of 
<BR>writing...&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>Two Tips for Strength</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Make Your Words Sell! </B>outlines several proven copywriting techniques to 
<BR>make headlines stronger. Here are two that especially apply to auction site 
<BR>headlines... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>1) Don’t try to be clever or cute -- </B>A headline needs to <B>immediately</B> 
<BR>attract a qualified customer. Your visitor must be able to clearly understand 
<BR>what you are selling – unlike in this case…&nbsp;</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG alt=Unclear.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Unclear.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>2) Be positive, rather than negative -- </B>Have a Perfect Golf Swing Like 
<BR>TIGER WOODS! If you are a golfer, wouldn’t you love to swing like Tiger? Isn’t 
<BR>that more powerful than something like... Don’t Swing In Your Usual Doofus 
<BR>Way – Buy Our Product! 
<BR></FONT><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Provide High-Value Content</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Hurrah! There aren’t as many space limitations in the content section as the 
<BR>headline area. But that doesn’t give you permission to drone on forever. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>To create high-value content in your listing... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>1) Be specific </B>-- It is crucial to be specific with your words. What kinds of 
<BR>details are important? The answer depends on what you are selling but let’s 
<BR>examine some possibilities... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>Your item was created by a designer or an artist or a company that is well 
<BR>known. If you have a vintage suit that is by Coco Chanel, or a handbag by 
<BR>Judith Liebner, you will command a higher price if you let your customers in on 
<BR>the information, rather than saying, “suit” or “purse.” 
<BR><B>• </B>Information and specifications like model numbers are important with 
<BR>technological products. 
<BR><B>• </B>Manufacturer’s name -- Many customers search for items by brands, rather 
<BR>than by category. For example, my son has a collection of Coca Cola signs. If 
<BR>you were selling tin advertising signs you could legitimately include them in 
<BR>several categories. With the Coke brand name, he can find them regardless of 
<BR>which category the seller chooses. 
<BR><B>• </B>Characteristics (such as color, size or shape) -- That gorgeous basket may 
<BR>not fit into the allotted space in a buyer’s sunroom. 
<BR><B>• </B>Manufacture date 
<BR><B>• </B>Provenance -- Provenance is the ownership history of your item. Perhaps it’s 
<BR>been in your family for six generations. 
<BR><B>• </B>Technique -- Are those doll clothes from a manufacturer, or were they handmade 
<BR>by Aunt Jill? 
<BR><B>• </B>Material -- For example, some people will buy shutters based totally on 
<BR>looks. It doesn’t matter if they are a laminate or plastic. Others, however, not 
<BR>only insist on wood but on a particular kind of wood. 
<BR><B>• </B>Country of origin -- This depends on what you are selling. A Swiss watch 
<BR>and Dutch chocolate mean something to many. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The more information you provide in your description, the fewer questions you 
<BR>will receive from prospective customers. The fewer e-mail inquiries you are 
<BR>required to answer, the more time you have to list other items, and generate 
<BR>income. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>2) Be positive </B>-- Just like in your headlines, <B>accentuate </B>the positive. Your 
<BR>customer needs a reason to buy from you. You want her to be excited about 
<BR>your 1959 Elvis record. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>A popular advertising slogan says, “The more you tell, the more you sell.” It’s a 
<BR>good rule-of-thumb to follow as long as you keep your description to a 
<BR>reasonable length. Give your reader a break. Leave out all the “You’ve got to 
<BR>have this or your life is ruined” stuff. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>3) Tell the truth about any negatives </B>-- Your customer must have a clear 
<BR>description of what she will be buying, both positive and negative. Be 
<BR>straightforward and honest with your information. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Deception is counterproductive for you and your customer. The description 
<BR>“unique” wastebasket does not really prepare your customer for its Statue of 
<BR>Liberty design. Provide the necessary details at the beginning and avoid the 
<BR>hassle of selling it and ending up with a return. Or worse -- an irate customer 
<BR>who blasts your name on all the auction sites. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>4) Never waste advertising space </B>-- Always promote your other auctions. 
<BR><B>Always! </B>The listing below illustrates this well...&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR>another auction. Further down, another opportunity to buy is highlighted...&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>5) Take advantage of your reputation </B>-- Promote yourself. eBay has 
<BR>power sellers who sell at least $2,000 a month. This elite group can use the 
<BR>logo below. You can feel reasonably certain that these power sellers will be 
<BR>fair. After all, are they going to risk that kind of income because they get in a 
<BR>dispute with a single seller? These sellers are professionals. 
<BR>If you get to use this logo, display it on every listing...&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The star insignia is another “bragging” tool... 
<BR>A yellow star = Feedback Profile of 10 to 49. 
<BR>A blue star = 50 to 99. 
<BR>A turquoise star = 100 to 499 
<BR>A purple star = 500 to 999 
<BR>A red star = 1,000 to 4,999 
<BR>A green star = 5,000 to 9,999 
<BR>A yellow shooting star = 10,00 to 24,999 
<BR>A turquoise shooting star = 25,000 to 49,999 
<BR>A purple shooting star = 50,000 to 99,999 
<BR>A red shooting star = 100,000 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>6) Be friendly and professional </B>-- Be friendly. Wish your customers well 
<BR>and welcome any questions or comments they might have to share. Answer 
<BR>promptly. A twenty four hour turn-around should be the minimum time on the 
<BR>Internet. A response within two or three hours is better. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>7) Be careful with your grammar and spelling </B>-- Forget what your 
<BR>English teacher said... sort of! You are writing to sell, not receive a grade. Be 
<BR>creative. Make your reader want to read your content. But there are limits. 
<BR>Spelling errors and garbage sentences detract from your message. The 
<BR>shorter the message, the more prominent the mistake...&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR><B>8) Don’t make extravagant claims </B>-- Recently, I heard a famous 
<BR>marketing person confidently explain, “Just tell them what they want to hear.” 
<BR>Really bad advice, unless it’s absolutely true. How credible is this ad?...&nbsp;</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>HTML Polish</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Personally, I approached the whole subject of HTML, trembling with fear. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to admit that I am technologically challenged with zero interest in learning</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anything about the computer. I only learn something if I need to do a specific</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>task and care nothing about why it works. Does this match your feelings? Rest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>assured then -- if I can do it, anyone can do it!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are fascinated by computer technology, you probably don’t need this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>section. Chances are you already know HTML. <B>Feel free to skip to the</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>next section.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>HTML </B>stands for <B>HyperText Markup Language.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Master HTML and you will be able to create those classy item descriptions with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>colors, various sizes and spacing. Otherwise, your ad will be in black lettering</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and it will be one long paragraph. There will be no spacing between features...</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When I was first doing my research, I noticed that often those items with HTML</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>code sold better than the ones without it. See the difference...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=RoseGarden.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/RoseGarden.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What a relief when I discovered that I basically only needed to learn four</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>commands. That’s the “up” side. The “down” side is that they must be perfect.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is absolutely no room for error. For sure, when I first saw this language I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>groaned thinking I would never, ever get it. Or that it would take me hours to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>write a single ad. And in truth, it was initially very time-consuming. Now it’s a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>snap!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>HTML gives you more <B>scope. </B>Sometimes a black and white ad works</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>perfectly. Sometimes it doesn’t. Experiment for yourself and see what works</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>best for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t have the time to learn HTML? Use one of the many available HTML</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>editors. I began with Netscape Composer which is free and can be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>downloaded straight off the Net. I now use <B>Dreamweaver </B>and it works</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>perfectly. Once you have the program, you simply click your mouse on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“Communicator,” then “Page Composer” and simply begin typing! The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>program writes all of the code for you! All you have to do is cut and paste your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ad right onto your auction site. It’s wonderful!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can add even more refinements like a colored background and pictures...</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Can you auction an item without a picture? Yes, but I definitely wouldn’t advise</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it. Do some research yourself to see if items without pictures sell as well as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>those who have them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some items absolutely <B>require </B>a picture. Can you imagine buying jewelry or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>art without seeing it? If you are selling a CD or a book, it may not be as crucial.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is one of the pictures that I used with the Fine China headline from above.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I took this picture right off the Internet from my supplier...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Teaset.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Teaset.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are two other ways to add pictures to your merchandise listing. The first</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>way is to use a regular camera and then scan your developed photograph. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you are getting a picture from printed material, a scanner is the only way to put</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it in your listings. The second way involves a <B>digital camera. </B>A digital</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>camera has the advantage of being instant with no film development required.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you do not have a scanner or a digital camera, or one you can borrow, don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buy them until you have done a few auction deals. Wait until you are sure you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to play the auction game and build a business. Once you definitely are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on your way, I truly think one or the other is indispensable.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Eliminate Mistakes</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>During my novice period in the auction business, I put two different books up</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for sale. Then I went to look for them. First lesson that I learned? An auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site doesn’t have your item entered three seconds after you submit it. Half an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hour later, I proudly checked on both of my items, and sure enough they were</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the Net. However, to my horror, I had the <B>same </B>picture for both of them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Panic! I had to call my computer guru to the rescue.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To prevent this same mistake, always review your work before you submit it. It</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>takes very little time and it will save a lot of repair work later on. Ask yourself...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Would I be interested in my item based on the title? Is it exciting, attentiongrabbing?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Is my description honest? Is it error-free or does it say Ole Elvs Presly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Rekord?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Have I included information on shipping and handling?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Is my picture clear and sharp? Will it help sell this item?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Do I sound friendly and approachable? Would I want to do business with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>me?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This seems tedious, especially at first, but you will save yourself grief later on.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Always keep an important objective in mind. <B>Make the most money in the</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>least time. </B>Whenever you have to go back and make corrections, or answer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions on obvious points, it costs you precious time. And you know the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>saying... Time is money… your money.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Repair Overlooked Errors</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I would like to pretend that I have been at this game so long that I never make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“misstakes” any longer. Alas! It ain’t so...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Do corrections <B>before </B>receiving a bid. For example, check...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>The title of your auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>The item category</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Anything at all about the description</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>The URL of your photo</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>v) </B>Acceptable payment terms or shipping information</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is a link on the auction site that says “Revise.” Just follow the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>instructions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Do corrections <B>after </B>receiving a bid. Basically, there are only two general</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>changes that can be added after you receive your first bid...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>You are allowed to change the <B>category. </B>For example, you put your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>vintage Spiderman comic in the “Action Figures” category and then decided it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would do better in “Comics.”</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>There were repeated questions from potential customers on the same point</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and you decide to <B>expand </B>your item description.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>You can withdraw your item if you receive <B>new </B>information. For example,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you discover that Aunt Mary’s etchings are actually reproductions, even though</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you heard all your life that they are originals. In the meantime, all your buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are bidding for originals and the price is much too high for their actual value.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If this ever happens, I would strongly advise you to contact every single bidder,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>explain what happened, and if possible, offer them something as a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consolation. In that way, instead of angry people raving about your ineptness,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you will have delighted fans raving about your <B>honesty.</B></FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Learn From the Best</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s time to look at some “real life” examples from sellers who have mastered</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the art of auction marketing. What do they do that makes them so successful?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I am using ads from the intensely competitive weight-loss section of eBay.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are lots and lots of all-natural super-weight-loss claims to be found on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the different auction sites. Some of these sit for seven to ten days with no bids</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>while others are swamped. Why?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The difference is in the listings. The products that don’t sell may be as good or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>better than those that do. But customers judge solely on the <B>content </B>of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>copy which is all they have to go by. So let’s learn from them. What principles</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>do these successful sellers use?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Use a clever listing title </B>-- Here is an ad that on the surface seems</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>really foolish. When I first read it, I had a negative reaction ... “Who is dumb</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enough to believe they will lose 80 pounds right away?”</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=WeightLoss.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/WeightLoss.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The seller makes fun of the extravagant and ridiculous claims that are made by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>so many. Immediately, we consider her a sensible person. She isn’t insulting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>our intelligence.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Remind your customers of the pain </B>-- Most people have very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>negative ideas about a weight loss project... of course, the seller is going to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>save </B>all her customers from this strenuous exercise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Use psychology to sell </B>-- Talk about great psychology. Imagine the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>overweight person, trapped in layers of fat, worrying about being too thin, or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>losing too fast. This “warning” is really a great selling tool...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Warning.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Warning.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(“Too” bad this seller didn’t review the listing first.)</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Be smart and use stories </B>-- Anyone who wants or needs to lose weight</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will identify with Jeff in the following story. A lot of the customers will have tried</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many of these methods themselves.</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Jeff.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Jeff.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The story approach is powerful. Jeff’s first-person narrative makes it easy for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the reader to connect and feel his struggle.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Explain any negatives in advance </B>-- No seller wants irate customers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contacting and yelling (well, the e-mail version of yelling) at him. So admit the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>downside up front…</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=SideEffects.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/SideEffects.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Notice how the seller minimizes the side effects.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Give extra value </B>-- Just look at what Jeff is offering his customers...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=WhatYouGet.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/WhatYouGet.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In addition, the customer receives recipes and weight loss tips.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Harness the power of endorsements and testimonials </B>-- This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strategy is effective because it convinces potential customers that these people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are real. An example of some testimonials...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Testimonies.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Testimonies.jpg" align=baseline border=0>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Use every publicity opportunity </B>-- eBay’s home page asks for your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>location. I have always given dull answers like “Atlanta, GA.” Here’s a much</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>better answer where you promote your Web site everywhere you can!</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=HealthStore.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/HealthStore.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) Take advantage of customer impatience </B>-- Your customers don’t like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to wait. One seller takes this into consideration...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=TheLie.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/TheLie.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>10) Learn from your mistakes </B>-- I have watched poorly selling products</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appear again and again, with no significant changes in results. We have seen</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>others that meet with dramatic success. Why in the world don’t the sellers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>study the ads of those who are flying high, and then change their methods? I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>honestly have no idea. Most don’t.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be sure not to make this mistake! If you fail, and someone else is succeeding,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your best remedy is to study the approach of the successful. You want to look</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>professional </B>at all times. Take Net auctions seriously. It is critical that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pay attention to details.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Always Have A Plan B</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What if an item just doesn’t sell no matter what you do? Don’t panic.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I read an interesting story in the Wall Street Journal about a couple who owned</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a gift shop in an economically-depressed town. Not only couldn’t they sell their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise. They couldn’t even give it away! They discovered eBay and are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>now, according to the “WSJ,” making $600,000 a year. They say that only 40%</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of their merchandise sells the first time around.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If an item doesn’t sell, you have several choices...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Re-list it. </B>When I first looked at eBay to sell an angel coin, I had a list of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seven possible categories. If you are selling a one-time item, this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>experimentation may not be worthwhile. But for a repeat-seller you need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know. Simply changing <B>categories </B>can make a huge difference because</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your customer base is so different.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Lower the price. </B>Knowing the value of any object is an art, not a science.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your best method of research is to look at similar items but even that does not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>guarantee exact conclusions. Sometimes, we have started too high and must</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make the choice of making less money or no money. Just because it “should”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell for $100 doesn’t mean that anyone is willing to pay that amount. In other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>words, be <B>flexible </B>in your assumptions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Try a different auction site. </B>If you are selling on a general site like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eBay or Amazon, try a specialized site, or vice versa. Those gruesomely</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive custom speakers that you are selling may not be appreciated by the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>general public. In contrast, someone on a specialized site might be drooling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for them, ready to mortgage the house and take out a bank loan.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As well, some sites just don’t have lots of traffic. Others seem to cater to more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>inexpensive items and your merchandise is too costly. There are a lot of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>differences among sites and you may have to experiment to find the best match</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for your interests.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Store it for awhile and try again later. </B>Hold it for a period of time</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and try again. Rafts and snowshoes definitely have seasonal value. And fads</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>come and go. Ask the inventor of the hula hoop!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Group it with other merchandise. </B>Include your unsold item with some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>other merchandise, as part of a package. Many auctioneers can make more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money for three items included as a bundle than they make for the three sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>separately. And many buyers will purchase items because there is something</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in the group that they really want.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is a standard practice in the mail order business to include a lot of items for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>higher price because weight sells, believe it or not. Entrepreneurs are taught</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that there is more money in bundling than in “cafeteria” selling.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Add extra value. </B>For example, I sold some gardening items by throwing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in some recipes for natural pesticides. The printing only costs a few extra</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cents. Since I already had the recipes, there was very little extra trouble for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>me.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Cautiously experiment with auction site options. </B>I recently went to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eBay’s <B>“Automobiles: Accessories: General” </B>to list an item. There were</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>over 14,000 items listed in the section I was considering. What are the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chances of someone finding my one little item? In this situation, the only way</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to really test this merchandise was to either pay extra to get more attention or to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pass. I choose not to list this merchandise due to my limited knowledge of this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>category.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, it’s different if you feel reasonably confident that you have a product</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that will sell well if only somebody becomes aware of it. In that situation, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may want to take the chance and pay for a more expensive listing option.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Realize that you are going to have some flops! </B>I have sold items</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that I never really thought would sell, and other “sure things” that were total</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>flops. I have given merchandise away as prizes, donated it to charity for tax</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>write-offs and sold it at flea markets or bazaars.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Keep in mind that the market is inexplicable. There are items which sell really</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>well at one time, and very poorly at others. Who knows why. Even though we</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>should try to understand why an item sells, or doesn’t, there is simply just no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>way to know for sure.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>About those mistakes...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you make a “mistake,” you can beat yourself up, berate yourself and call</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yourself all the names that are synonyms for stupid. Or you can use it as a step</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>towards making your business more profitable, more successful. If this sounds</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ridiculous, consider that there are two steps involved in turning a mistake into a</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>triumph...</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>First, re-label mistake and call it <B>feedback. </B>This takes all the emotional</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>baggage out of the equation. “Feedback” is an emotionally neutral word to me,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and if it isn’t that way for you, find a similar word that is non-judgmental.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Second, calmly <B>examine </B>this merchandise to figure out why it didn’t sell. But</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>always keep your goal in mind -- to have fun, make money and create thrilled</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers who will come back and buy from you, again and again. In this way,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your unsold merchandise helps you to see what <B>modifications </B>you need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make in your methods.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps you have heard the people using the analogy of the guided missile? 
<BR>Apparently, it is off-target about 95%+ of the time. It merely corrects itself and 
<BR>thus finds its target. In same way, consider every item you put up for sale as a 
<BR><B>step </B>towards your success. Sometimes, you may have to make a correction 
<BR>but that’s part of doing business. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Just keep your <B>focus </B>intent on your goal. And you will achieve it. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>OK. Your auction listing did its job perfectly. It attracted lots of targetedcustomers and you have your...</FONT>
