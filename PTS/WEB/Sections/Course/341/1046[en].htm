<B><FONT size=4>First Sale!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Congratulations! You just made your first sale! If you’re like me, you checked</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your first listing about every two and a half minutes. The first time I saw an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>actual bid on one of my items was a super thrill. Wow! This stuff really works!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We know in our minds that people make money on auctions but it’s like looking</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at a picture of a piece of cherry pie. There’s nothing like the real thing! So now</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what happens?...</FONT>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>First Contact With Your Auction Site</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You will receive an <B>e-mail </B>from the auction site. Here is one I received on an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information product that I sold…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Both buyer and seller will receive a message with instructions to contact each</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>other within <B>three </B>days.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>First Contact With Your Buyer</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you want your transactions to be 100%, A+, perfect, make sure that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>communicate <B>completely </B>and <B>clearly </B>with every single customer. I simply</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>assume that everyone I deal with is a complete novice with no experience. Of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>course, this isn’t the case at all but if I make this assumption, everything usually</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goes well.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Every communication with every buyer should always include the following</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Congratulations </B>-- It isn’t necessary but it sure is smart. The friendlier</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and more professional you are, the better you will do in the auction business.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Purchase Reminder </B>-- Always specify what your customer bought. Many</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people deal in multiple auctions and may have bought or sold dozens of items</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that week. Remind your buyer of who you are and what he bought from you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(He might be asking himself -- “Who is this guy and why should I send him</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$131.95?”)</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Item Number </B>-- Include the number of the item that was <B>issued by the</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>auction site. </B>There are several reasons to do this...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>It will help your buyers to give you feedback because it is done by item</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>number.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Many auctioneers keep <B>comprehensive </B>records. This type of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>organization pays off, especially for tax day. In addition, they are able to get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>confirmation from the auction site, if necessary.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Price </B>-- You surely don’t want any mistakes here.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Payment Options </B>-- Even though those were included in your item</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>description, always review them. Many people forget and this is especially</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>important if you are going to hold a check for 10 days.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Your Address (if applicable) </B>-- The buyer needs your mailing address</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>so that he knows where to send payment. Many people operate on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>principle of the-less-the-world-knows-about-me-the- better. Accordingly, they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have a mailbox to receive payments. Others don’t care. It is strictly a matter of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>personal preference </B>but it is one that you should consider now.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Needless to say, this is not an issue if you are using credit cards or third party</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>payment methods.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) The Cost of Shipping and Handling </B>-- You may or may not have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>included the actual amount in your auction listing. If you did, repeat it. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have not, tell them the cost now.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t know how to figure it? Don’t worry, the <B>next chapter will explain this</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>in detail.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Insurance </B>-- I always let the buyer decide if he wants to pay for insurance</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because he is the one paying for it (or not). Generally, though, the more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive the item is, the more likely the buyer is to desire insurance.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, if the buyer does not pay for insurance, you will need to decide, in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advance, what your policy will be if the package is lost or damaged.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This can <FONT face="Times New Roman">be a real sore spot between buyer and seller. </FONT>The seller may feel</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that if the buyer hasn’t paid for insurance then the responsibility is the buyer’s.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On the other hand, how is the buyer to know that the package was actually</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sent?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>My resolution works this way -- if I am shipping Priority mail, I automatically pay</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for <B>tracking. </B>In this way, I can prove that the package was mailed and I am</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relieved of responsibility.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, if I am not mailing priority, the issue becomes a little stickier because</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>no tracking is available. In the past, I have mailed items and crossed my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fingers. If the item isn’t terribly expensive, I will replace anything that is lost in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the mail. If the merchandise is more expensive, I insist on insurance or state</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>loudly and clearly that I won’t take responsibility for mailing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It seems as though the obvious answer is to simply raise the price to cover the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cost but remember that the more your merchandise costs, the less likely you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are to sell it. I think the best compromise is to pay for tracking, where available.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) Buyer’s Address </B>-- Ask the buyer where he wants you to send his new</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prize. Some pros go ahead and wrap the package for mailing once the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>transaction is completed. Others do not because it is always possible that the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer may not follow through and send their payment. In that case, you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>either have to redo the label, or put “post-its” on the package so that you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know what it contains.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Those wrapped boxes...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>...all look alike after awhile.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>10) Inclusion of the Item Number With the Payment </B>-- If your buyer is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>paying with a check or money order, you might ask your buyer to please</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>indicate the name of the item on his payment. This can save you buckets of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time. If you receive 20 checks in one day, are you going to remember Bill</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wilson’s purchase?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>11) Suggestion to Exchange Feedback </B>-- Always suggest reciprocal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>feedback. The more times you suggest this, the more likely you are to get it.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Critical Record Keeping</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are just going to do a sale here and there, you probably won’t need an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>extensive record keeping system. For instance, let’s say you sell a couple of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>things a month from your home. Depending on how organized you are, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>should be fine.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One summer, I conducted an experiment to see what would happen if I created</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a <B>super-organized </B>system with employees. So I hired my college-age</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>daughter and one of her friends while school was out. It took a short while for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them to get the hang of the auction business but by the end of the summer, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profits were flooding in. In my best week, I made $4700+ in <B>profit</B>, not gross!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Our super organizational system is what paid off. Two examples show how...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>I sold a customer a tote bag and she returned it because she decided she</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wanted a colored one (it was black leather) and I agreed to refund her money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I then received a “warning” message from PayPal because she claimed that I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>had not sent her a refund. In less than five minutes, I was able to prove that I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>had sent her a refund. She looked foolish and end of PayPal problem. Of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>course, I could have eventually proven that I had paid her but it could have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>been a long, drawn out problem.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Another customer won an auction and sent me several messages after the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction complaining about various things. Finally, I told her to withdraw her bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and I wouldn’t send any negative feedback. Frankly, I was happy just to be rid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of her. Approximately two months later, she sent me a threatening message --</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>she was about to report me to eBay because I had never sent her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise. Again, in a couple of minutes I was able to locate her own email</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ending our transaction and forwarded it to her. I never heard another</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sound from her.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The reason for these two anecdotes in to emphasize how <B>necessary </B>it is to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have an organizational system.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I confess! I am naturally a disorganized, haphazard person. Self-defense has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>made me get my act together. If you are one of those organized, everything-inits-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>place people, this will come easy for you. If you’re not, don’t despair. If I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can do it, anyone can.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To build a successful auction business, you need to get a system going</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>immediately. <B>Organization </B>makes a difference...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Good service means happy customers </B>-- If you don’t keep good</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>records, you will soon be floundering and making mistakes. Not the best way</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to impress your customers. Ask me how I know? Let me horrify you with some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of my mistakes...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I once sent a customer the wrong merchandise! For the sake of good customer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relations, I asked him to keep what I sent him and then mailed the correct</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise at my expense. Sure did lose money on that deal! Another time I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>received two money orders and didn’t know why. Eventually the buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contacted me but delivery was late and they were less than thrilled with my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customer service.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you have several auctions going, you will soon get lost and make pointless</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and <B>expensive </B>mistakes. Learn from my foolishness and keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>comprehensive records right from the very first transaction.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Tax Purpose </B>-- Even though there are no Internet taxes at this time, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>still have to pay income tax. You certainly want to claim every single legitimate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>deduction. You need good records to do this so that you will have a complete</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>list of every transaction you have made -- who, what and how much. No last</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>minute rummaging to find the necessary information.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Customer List </B>-- You are creating your own customer list. If Joe bought</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or bid on your antique telephone, he may be very interested in similar items in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the future.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Legal Protection </B>-- In the event of any future problems, <B>have all your</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>information...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... at your fingertips.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, George files a complaint with an auction site, or even a law</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enforcement agency, that he paid you $240 for the Fantasia Sericel but he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>never received it. If your records are complete, it will take you only moments to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>find the tracking number. You can then confirm that George’s package was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>delivered, and you are protected! Without records, you may be in a mad</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>scramble to cover yourself and end up refunding George’s money, while he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>laughs to himself about his free Disney memorabilia.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Identification of profitable items </B>-- How can you know what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise is profitable and what isn’t...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... without agonizing </B>over the computer for hours? If your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>records are good, you will be able to tell at a glance which items are profitable,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and which are not. You can also evaluate degrees of profitability. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, your records will show that with this item your profit is 137% but with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>another it’s 482%. The more <B>distinctions </B>you can make, the more powerful</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your selling will be!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Five Areas of Key Information</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whatever your system, you need to concentrate your record keeping efforts in</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>5 areas...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Merchandise</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Buyer</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Payment</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Shipping</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) </B>Customer Relationships</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you really get involved with auctions as a major player, you will need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>master a 6th critical area which involves <B>profitability. </B>This, however, isn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>necessary when you are first beginning.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Know your merchandise. </B>You may be thinking, “Well, duhhhh! Of course I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know what I’m selling!” Perhaps you do. But to point out how confusing it gets,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>think about some of my sales. I have sold briefcases... dozens of times. Not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>only that, I have sold five different versions on four different auction sites!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps you will do the same, and you get a message from a buyer that begins</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“The briefcase I bought from you...” Yikes! Which one?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is what you must record about your merchandise...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>A <B>description </B>of the item</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The <B>site </B>where you listed it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The auction <B>dates </B>-- both when you submitted it and the day it sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The auction <B>number </B>given to you by your auction site -- you can always</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>track an item if you have the number!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Know your buyer. </B>Recently I received a message that said, “Sorry -- (an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>address).” No name, no explanation, no item description, no nothing. Clearly I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>had sent this buyer an address request, and he expected me to remember.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But, I didn’t. And if you are selling hundreds of items a week, you won’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>remember, either. If you get messages like this, what will you do?...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Choice one</B>... you click “reply” on your e-mail, grit your teeth, and ask (as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>politely as possible) who this person is and what this message is about. Not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the greatest customer relationship strategy.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Choice two </B>-- you spend a lot of time looking through all your buyers trying to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>figure out who this belongs to because at least you have their e-mail address!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(Unless they’ve sent the e-mail from a different address. Horrors!)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Before I got organized, I would spend as much time as it took to plow through</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all my information, looking for the correct address. What an expensive way to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>operate! Always place a <B>monetary </B>amount on your time, based on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>income you want to make and the hours you are willing to spend.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You need the following information on your buyer ...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Name</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>E-mail address</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Auction site user name</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Home address</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I also suggest that you create a folder in your e-mail program and save</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>messages from your buyers. How long do you save this stuff? I usually save it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for about four months but there is no hard and fast rule. I get aggravated with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that stuff cluttering up my computer but it’s a prudent practice.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Know the payment method. </B>Were you paid with a credit card, a money</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>order, a check, PayPal or some other way? For example, you might assume</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that big companies like PayPal or Visa never make mistakes so you don’t have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to know this stuff. Wrong! They do make errors and you may lose money if you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>aren’t paying attention.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Record how you were paid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Keep track of the payment date. This is especially critical if you hold checks</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>until they clear. It is very easy to forget to mail when the 10 days are up! I have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>solved this problem with an calendar and daily reminder. I set my calendar so</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that on the appropriate day I am reminded to send mail to the customer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>It isn’t absolutely necessary but you might want to <B>record the number </B>of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the check or money order, if any.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Know shipping details. </B>Customers want their merchandise promptly. And</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you need to be able to answer questions if Joe sends you an e-mail asking</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about his package.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Who was your carrier?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What date did you mail?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>If your buyer is paying the exact shipping costs, rather than a set amount, or if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they are paying extra for insurance, record the cost once you figure it out</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Several times I have received e-mails from customers that tell me that they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have accidentally deleted or lost the shipping costs or insurance charges. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>definitely don’t want to have to re-weigh and re-figure. Once is enough!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A real time saver... since I use almost always use the Post Office, and the fees</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are set, I have typed them up and keep a copy handy.</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Record any tracking or insurance numbers -- then choose a particular spot in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your office and save those receipts! You want to be able to prove you mailed</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the item. Later, you will want to move those receipts to your tax file. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receive a check for $50, and $9 is for shipping, you don’t want to have to pay</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>learn that poor customer service is a very costly mistake that many Internet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchants make. And, if you are an auction seller, you are indeed a Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchant. So it is in your best interests to provide great service. We talk about</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3><B>Record feedback</B>. Remember... to get it, you have to give it. So include a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reminder to give feedback. I make a habit of giving all my appropriate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>feedback once a week, usually on Friday afternoon. Doing this every time you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receive a payment, or every day, is not necessary. Of course, giving doesn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>necessarily mean that you will receive.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Record profits, losses and taxes. </B>Suppose you hold a Dutch auction of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>25 calculators. If you don’t know all your costs, plus the amount of time you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spent on the auction, then how will you know whether you should repeat it? Or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whether you should change some of the terms of the auction to make it more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profitable?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, you might make more money by selling 50 calculators at a time,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>rather than 75. Or perhaps you need to raise your opening bid. Maybe you’d</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>do better if your auction ended on Monday night rather than Saturday</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>afternoon.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The variables are many but you can’t get an accurate picture without <B>quality</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>feedback. </B>That is why careful records are a powerful money-making tool.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here’s how I tackle this...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• A monthly tracking feature </B>-- This enables me to track and view my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items by month. I need to see when specific items are the most profitable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because some auction months are better than others. eBay states that profits</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are down between Thanksgiving and Christmas and highest in the the first</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>quarter of the year.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Opening price </B>-- this is a great arena for testing. Experiment with different</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>opening prices and see which are most profitable. Great market research</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information! If you study opening prices, over time you will get a better feel for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how to open your bidding, about whether to use reserve auctions and become</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>skilled in setting a minimum price.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Quantity </B>-- this really matters when you are using the Dutch auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strategy. You need accurate feedback so that you will know to only auction 50</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at a time, rather than 500. There is no need to waste money on insertion fees!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Closing date </B>-- You can learn all kinds of information from this. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, you will learn how long your auctions should be. After all, if you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make as much money on a three day auction as a 10 day one, why not receive</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your profits faster? You will also learn how to make your buyer contact</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>procedures as efficient as possible. If your auction closed on January 10, and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you didn’t receive all your money until February 27, you need to re-evaluate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what you are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• End price </B>-- there is absolutely no way to figure profit unless you know what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you received for your merchandise. I have deposited as many as 23 checks in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one day. My checkbook will only list the total. Then I have no idea what each</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>individual item sold for -- unless I keep good records.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Item cost </B>-- This is one of the most critical parts of your record keeping! It is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>crucial to profit and tax records. To figure profits, you need the following</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>What is the auction fee, if any?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>What did the item cost you?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>What did you receive for the final sale price?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, you paid $20 for an item, it sold for $65.30 and you paid $3.90 to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the auction. Your profit on this item was <B>276%! </B>Not bad at all. And your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>actual profit on this item was $41.40, which is your taxable amount.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The best advice on this subject is... <B>don’t rely on your memory for any</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>auction information! </B>Memory may -- or may not -- be reliable if you are only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling two items. Don’t waste many precious (and expensive) hours. Ask me</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how I know!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your record keeping is vitally important to your success so get organized as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>soon as you begin trading. Don’t try and do extensive record keeping at once,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>however. Follow the same process as you do with the rest of your auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business -- start small and experiment. Let your knowledge and experience</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>grow.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now you have to somehow get the sold treasure to your buyer. If you don’t do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it right, it will cost you a lot of time and money. Here’s the smart way...</FONT>
