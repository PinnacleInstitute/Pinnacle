<B><FONT size=4>Start Generating Profit</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>At last, we have come to the really fun part -- the <B>money-making </B>part! Here is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>where you get the information and ideas you need to change your life. It is a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>game in which you can build a successful business with minimal risk.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Net auction business is fascinating and filled with unexpected surprises.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Where else can you spot a package of coca-cola gum that sold for $2500?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Imagine that…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… $500 to chew a stick of gum! </B>Eat your heart out,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Hollywood!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One of the beautiful parts about the auction game is that you begin to make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contacts. As the word spreads, people are soon calling you. Opportunities</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appear. Fresh ideas flower. You begin to see all kinds of exciting new</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>opportunities and intriguing directions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Hopefully, at this point, you have a clearer focus on where you want to go with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions. The next few chapters will give you lots of ideas to get you on your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>way. Work with these ideas. Mix and match and create original combinations.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Shift an idea to a different field. Basically, use these approaches to open the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>door to thousands of possibilities.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Will you like every idea that is presented? No way! Perhaps you may like nine</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the ideas. If so, make a list of these and prioritize them. Or perhaps you see</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the potential of certain ideas for your particular situation but they would have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be modified to meet your needs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The point here is to stimulate your <B>own </B>creative juices, not copy exactly what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone else has already done. A quick word of advice… If you consider this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a chore or a task or a drag, find some other way to win fame and fortune. A Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction business takes serious effort to achieve success and to have fun along</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the way.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you <B>eat an elephant?…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>…One bite at a time. </B>The joke might be getting a little stale</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>but the symbolism remains fresh. Grow your Net auction business piece by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>piece.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This point must be emphasized again and again... <B>be cautious. </B>Experiment</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and do your homework before you buy really expensive items or rush into</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Dutch auctions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We live in the “World of Instant Gratification.” However, auction wealth is a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>process based on <B>knowledge </B>and <B>experience </B>and the only way to get that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is to proceed slowly and cautiously until you know what you are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sorry to be a party pooper but the get-rich-quick folks are deceiving</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>themselves. Only a tiny handful of people in any field hit the top level right out</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the gate. It is prudent to assume that you won’t be an instant success.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On your mark, get ready. Where do you start?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Well, just like anything else, at the beginning. Focus on your customer. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can offer her what she wants, you will be able to get what you want from her --</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>i.e., her business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s think through why someone will choose to buy off the Internet or an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction site. There are, of course, many reasons but the three primary ones</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are worth repeating…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Convenience </B>-- the commodity most in demand in our culture is <B>time.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Personally, I think it is amazing what people will pay to have done for them but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>there are many affluent people to whom money is of much less importance</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>than convenience.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Price </B>-- many other people search the sites for a great price. Sometimes</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an item costs more on an auction site than it does in the store but it’s rare.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) The merchandise is unusual</B>. In our mass-produced world, there are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more and more people who are developing an appreciation for quality, for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>craftsmanship, for uniqueness. That sentiment provides a marvelous</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>opportunity for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whenever you are seeking goods or services to sell, constantly ask yourself if it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>has one of these three qualities -- <B>convenience, great price or</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>uniqueness. </B>If it does, investigate further. If it doesn’t, move on down the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>road.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It goes without saying, no item… no sale. So start looking and be open to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>possibilities. What items appeal to you? Which ones do not? What are the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>latest trends? What might be the next big happening? Search with critical</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eyes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Get out of the house. Visit department stores, hardware stores, gardening and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auto-supply stores. Go to the mall. Get on mailing lists and look at catalogs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Go to trade shows. Read lots of consumer magazines and study the ads. Meet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new people. Make some phone calls. E-mail/write some letters. Try new</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>foods, new hobbies, new sports.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Snoop around. Be curious. Think. <B>Have fun.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This chapter deals with selling your own goods, a popular strategy for Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction business owners. It does not mean you necessarily have the goodies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in your possession, or have spent your own money to acquire them. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>method has three variations...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) Sell merchandise you already own</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) Find bargain merchandise to sell</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>3) Drop ship</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s start with the first variation…</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Sell Goods You Already Own</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The first, and easiest, way to begin your Internet auction career is to sell goods</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that you already own. This is how most people begin and I certainly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>recommend this way for the novice.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Time to clean out your own closets, attics and basements. Obviously, there are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many advantages to this method of spring cleaning…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Forget those garage sales</B>. First of all, you don’t have to sit in a hot</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>garage all day long with a determined and cheery smile on your face. To have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a successful garage sale, someone must be “on duty,” available to answer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions and take money. If you sell those same goodies on the Internet, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can go about your life while the sale goes on. No need to spend your day</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sitting behind a table, chatting with strangers.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) You have access to millions of buyers</B>. You can go beyond your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>surrounding neighborhood.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) There is no risk involved. </B>You can try it out, see if you like it, and then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decide if it is a game you want to play. Do you know of any other business that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can be experienced in such a modest way? I certainly don’t.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After you clean out your own house or apartment, you can start with your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relatives. Surely, grandma doesn’t need that old high chair anymore and Aunt</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Lucy doesn’t read those Golden Books from your early childhood. What a thrill</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it is (and sometimes, an unexpected sadness) to see these old treasures move</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on to new homes and new owners.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, if you are an eager auctioneer, you are eventually going to run out of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>personal goods to sell. Now what? Well, it’s time to put on your shirt with the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>giant <B>“BH” </B>on the front -- your <B>Bargain Hunter </B>shirt and <B>begin looking</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>for...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... bargain merchandise.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The goal is to find merchandise that you can buy at a very cheap price and sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at a much higher one.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Where are the Bargains?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Bargain merchandise might be worth a fortune to someone else. Or it might</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not. But don’t let that deter you. The thrill of the chase is intoxicating. Once it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gets in your blood, you will develop that glint in the eye that marks a true</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>treasure hunter. (Does this mean we are the modern version of pirates?)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So where are the treasures to be found?…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Garage sales </B>-- Follow the <B>signs…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… to Weekend Bargain Paradise.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you have done your homework, decided upon your niche and researched</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prices on the auction sites, then you have a reasonable idea of what you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>looking for and what you can afford to pay in order to make a profit. Many</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>times people have no idea about the value of what they are selling. What</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>looks like an old mismatched dish may be a valuable and rare piece of English</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dinnerware and that old book no one wants may be a first edition.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Tag sales </B>-- These are usually located indoors, often in malls, old barnlike</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>structures or empty buildings. There are many garage and tag sale</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hounds who live for the weekend when most such sales are held. You can be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sure that somewhere amid all this flotsam is a treasure or two. Some of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>best bargains in the world can be found at these sales.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Garage and tag sales aren’t for everyone, though. It takes stamina as great</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items are found only by plowing through tons of junk. And competition can be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stiff.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Estate sales </B>-- Nothing stirs the blood of the pro shopper like hearing,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“everything must go” or “selling to the bare walls.” Such enticements often</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>indicate an estate sale where the entire contents of a home are being sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because someone has passed away, or was moved to a nursing-home or is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>downsizing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes professionals handle these sales. As a result, finding a bargain is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more challenging. The most profitable sales are those in which the heirs live</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>out of town. When this happens, the sale may be handled by neighbors or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>friends. Their main concern is to get everything sold. They just want to go</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>home!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Thrift shops </B>-- When things don’t sell at garage or estate sales, they often</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>get donated to charity for a tax write-off. Some people just prefer to skip the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hassle of selling their throwaways and take the tax deduction. The charity then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sells the goods in its thrift shop to fund its programs.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The stores are often musty, crammed, and disorganized so it pays to be a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>regular and know the days that new donations are put out. Usually the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>employees in this kind of shop know very little about the value of their goods.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That means you have to know your merchandise to find the bargains.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Consignment shops </B>-- These stores receive most of their inventory from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people who want to get rid of desirable items but can’t be bothered with selling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them. These sellers consign their unwanted goods to the shop. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shopkeeper receives a percentage, usually 25 to 50%, of the proceeds when</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the item sells. To ensure a steady turnover of merchandise, most shops limit</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the length of time that goods are held for sale. When that period expires,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consignees must pick up the item. In some cases, ownership reverts to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shop if the owner fails to return for it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many stores start an automatic mark-down after a predetermined time. Not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much haggling goes on before this point in time because the sellers have an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agreed-upon price with the shop owners. When this mark-down time begins,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>opportunity knocks. If you get to know the shop owners, usually they will let</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you know when these times occur.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Flea markets </B>-- they have constant turnover and huge amounts of items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of the dealers are incredibly savvy and others are totally ignorant.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes dealers dump entire estates at many of the bigger markets. If this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interests you, find a local market and work it regularly. As you become familiar</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with the usual dealers and their wares, you’ll be better able to spot items that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>haven’t shown up before.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are pessimistic individuals who contend that there are no bargains to be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>had at flea markets. Yet there are Net auction sellers who regularly make sixfigure</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>incomes just from flea markets. (Maybe they’re the ones who start these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>no-bargain rumors!) The best bargains are found if you’re there at dawn or as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the dealers are packing up at the end of the day or weekend.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Antique malls and co-op markets </B>-- The dealers who rent these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spaces keep them well-stocked with constant changes of merchandise. They</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are also an efficient way to shop, since you can see merchandise from dozens</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of dealers in one relatively small space. The quality of the goods varies from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>garbage to great -- sometimes even in the same stall. That is why you have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know your merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most malls offer a 5-15% discount for dealers or have a dealer price coded on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the tag. To get this discount, you need a business card or resale number or a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tax number that verifies your status as a dealer. This isn’t hard to get and if you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are serious about this part of the business, I strongly urge you to do this.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can also haggle and bargain. Always try to negotiate. Even if the dealer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>turns you down, you have lost nothing. Remember that the items for sale</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>belong to specific dealers. The folks at the cash register only take the money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you have a question or want to make a lower offer, most malls are happy to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pick up the phone and contact that dealer for you. If you find something that’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>great but overpriced, make an offer. Even if the mall can’t reach a dealer, they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may offer you a dealer’s discount whether you have the credentials or not. It’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their way of sweetening the pot. If not, leave your offer and phone number.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The mall can ship the item later if the dealer accepts.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Antique malls often <B>feature…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>…attention-grabbing sales </B>so if you’re buying ahead of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>curve, you might be able to wait until it is marked down. Check back the last</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>week of the month. Booth rent is usually due on the first. If they haven’t sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enough to make their rent, dealers might be motivated to make a sale.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Antique shows </B>-- These are a great place to purchase items and learn</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about the market. Many people falsely assume that shows are overpriced.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This can be true for some but many are not.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Shop in the same way you would for any auction. Make low offers on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everything. You are bound to score on some of it. In some shows you may buy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a premium admission ticket so that you are able to preview and buy early. One</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>great purchase can easily cover the cost of your ticket.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In addition, some antiques shows offer benefit previews for charities and/or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>organizations such as museums. They throw elaborate parties the night</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>preceding the show’s opening to the public. If you are willing to join these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>groups and learn the key elements of this field, you will have the inside track</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on all kinds of merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) Specialized collectible shows </B>-- These are shows that are dedicated</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strictly to one field of collecting. You’ll likely see lots of similar items and be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>able to hold them, inspect them, and learn differences in quality, condition and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>value. Price shopping and haggling is a must.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These shows often include wonderful learning opportunities such as lectures,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>demonstrations and exhibits. Take advantage of these mini-training sessions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>10) Traditional auctions </B>-- These auctions can be a great place to find</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargains and experience <B>an adrenaline rush…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>…as the auctioneer starts his “who-will-give-me”</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>bidding call. </B>However, live auctions and Internet trading differ substantially.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The business of auction houses is to sell items for other people and get the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>best price they can for their customers who consign items for sale. Auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>houses make their money by a commission charged to the consignee and a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>premium paid by the buyer. Both are based on a percentage of the sale.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Net auctions aren’t like this at all because the price is strictly between the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer and the seller. There is no “middleman” except for very minimal fees (if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>any) from the auction site. Therefore, your customers expect to get a bargain.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>11) Specialized clubs </B>-- Whatever you collect, there’s probably a club or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>association for it. Members generally pay a fee to belong, entitling them to a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>newsletter, price information and bulletins on conventions and shows. If there</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is something that fascinates you, join these associations to find merchandise</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and develop your expertise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>12) Small Internet auction sites </B>-- There are many, many small auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sites that have very little traffic. If you are following the prices in your chosen</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>niches, you can sometimes find products on these sites and sell them for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profit on the biggies like eBay, Amazon and Yahoo.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>13) Outlet malls </B>-- Outlet malls are collections of stores that belong to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>manufacturers, rather than to individual shop owners who sell diverse</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise. These stores stock products that didn’t sell and therefore are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“yesterday‘s” goods or they are “seconds,” with slight or even major flaws.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>14) Trade shows </B>-- Trade shows are fabulous places to find merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The vendors themselves are present and may be quite eager to deal with you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One great thing about trade shows is that you can sometimes find the more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unusual merchandise that isn’t in every WalMart.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you live in or near a larger city, you can find these shows by contacting the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Chamber of Commerce. On the Net, some helpful sources are…</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>15) Seconds and overstocks </B>-- There are many stores that buy entire train</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or car loads of “seconds,” overstocks and closeout merchandise, such as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“Dollar Tree” or “Big Lots.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many of their items are definitely not bargains but sometimes there are items</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that can be sold for a very generous profit. This is definitely a method for those</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who love to shop because there will be some fruitless expeditions. It is best to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>discover when shipments arrive and to make a quick tour through the store on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a regular basis, searching only for those items that are new. You also need to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>think about shipping and handling when choosing items.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>16) Specialized magazines and newspapers </B>-- There are many people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who sell goods who have absolutely no idea what their merchandise is worth.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Ads in specialized magazines can be a gold mine! Magazines like the “Thrifty</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Nickel” and the “Trader” magazines (the “Auto Trader,” the “Truck Trader,” etc.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are examples. Almost every community has these “ad magazines” where the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>local citizens advertise goods for sale.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One wonderful phrase to look for is OBO, <B>“</B>Or Best Offer.” That means the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller is very open to negotiation. Jot down this lucrative tip... when you go to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargain with an individual for merchandise, if at all possible take <B>cash. </B>The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sight of actual money is a much more powerful motivator than a check. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller knows that I am ready to buy at that moment. It’s hard for the seller to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>resist because the sale is a done deal -- there’s no “I’ll-think-about-it-and-letyou-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know” response.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another important point about buying from individuals is this... <B>distance</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>matters. </B>My time is too valuable to drive a couple of hours to make $50 or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$100. I am sure that yours is too. The auction game is about making maximum</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money in minimum time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Therefore, if you live in a big city, know your geography before you go looking.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The only exception might be if you want to just practice your negotiation skills.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps you have found something intriguing or interesting and you just would</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>like to try negotiating. The extra time expenditure for traveling is secondary.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I learned a lot about real estate investment from a very successful guru who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>teaches a very important principle... <B>we make money when we buy, not</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>when we sell. </B>This is absolutely true in the auction business. If you decide</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to tattoo any advice on your arm, make sure it is this valuable insight.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>17) Wholesale </B>-- There are many companies that specialize in wholesale</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise. What is wholesale? It is “supposed” to be the price at which the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>manufacturer sells to the retail stores. Of course, we all know that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandising games are played every day so buyer beware -- “caveat</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>emptor.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are really two distinct categories of wholesalers. The first are companies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who wholesale the merchandise they manufacture. The second kind is an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>independent that buys large amounts of goods from manufacturers, stores</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them in big ugly warehouses and resells them. Some of them are open to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>private individuals, and others sell only large amounts to other companies or to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>brokers. It’s simple to find out their policies.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>18) Closeout merchandise </B>-- Closeout merchandise is the greatest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargain around. It usually means that <B>someone wants to…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… unload items </B>onto whoever wants to carry them next.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Closeout merchandise is distressed for some reason (i.e., “shelf life,” trucking</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>accident, end of fad). They are much cheaper than wholesale. The problem is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that normally you can’t buy just one. You must buy in bulk. However, you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>usually buy samples.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Test, test, test! </B>See if the one item sells, and if it does, buy more.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>19) Pawn Brokers </B>-- Pawn brokers are <B>loaded with inexpensive...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… lightweight, easy-to-ship items. </B>They can be a rich source</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of valuable merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, much depends on the actual pawnbroker. His willingness to deal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>depends mostly on the neighborhood he works. Shops in more affluent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>neighborhoods are less eager to co-operate. Whereas in some less</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prosperous areas the brokers tend to be a bit more accommodating. It takes</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some scouting and legwork to find the right people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are some brokers who would do almost anything to help -- including</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>permission to take pictures of merchandise and sell it without the item ever</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>leaving the store. If you decide to do that, be certain to insist on a guarantee</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that they will hold your items. Otherwise, you may sell something and not be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>able to deliver to your buyer.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>20) Ethnic treasures </B>-- Another little-thought-of place to find fascinating,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unique items are ethnic neighborhoods. The auction sellers get to know the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchants and establish a good reputation as folks who can move</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise. As sellers become accepted as insiders, people start bringing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products to them. The sellers no longer have to go hunting. This is the ideal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>situation!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>21) Find bargains on trips </B>-- Any time you go on a trip, keep your auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eye peeled for profitable items. In the mountains of Tennessee, I bought</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>several chess sets that were carved of onyx and quite beautiful. I averaged</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$60 worth of profit on those sets…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>22) Other auction sources...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>Local governments sell property confiscated from criminals, stolen property</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whose owners are a mystery, and equipment and supplies they no longer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need. States and provinces also auction off property that is abandoned in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>safety deposit boxes.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Airlines sell luggage that is unclaimed.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Dry cleaners sell abandoned garments, often simply for the price of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cleaning bill.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>Storage facilities (the kind you rent by the month) are very hot business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>properties. They always have people who don’t bother to keep up with their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>payments and often hold auctions and sell off goods at very low prices.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The owners are losing money if their space isn’t rented. Storage facilities</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>range from very sophisticated ones with their own trucks (who probably sell on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the auctions themselves) to unsophisticated ones who just want that “junk”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gone!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Government Bargains</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are lots of wild, underground stories that make the rounds. You know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the kind. Someone buys a new Mercedes for $25 (well, OK, maybe not that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>good!) However, the reason for the stories is that there are many great,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>legitimate bargains to be had from the government. Governments are often</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more concerned about moving the product rather than getting top dollar.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Big government spends lots of money. There are bound to be mistakes,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>several even. As well, government agencies seize lots of goods for various</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reasons. The IRS seizes property to help pay tax bills. The Customs</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>department takes property belonging to drug dealers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In spite of the urban myths about the bargains, most people don’t really know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>where to find these goodies. Therefore, the search may take a little work but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>there are great deals to be had. An easy place to look is the “legal notices”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>section of large newspapers. Other sources are...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Postal Service Auctions </B>-- The Post Office sells off undeliverable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise which tends to be usually in the gift category. (Not too many cars</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are sent through the mail.) The Post Office operates regional centers. More</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information is available at <B>http://www.usps.com/auctions/</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Customs And Treasury </B>--</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>(http://www.ustreas.gov/auctions/customs/subscrib.html) . </B>The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Customs Department have different types of sales...cyclic (held regularly),</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>specialty (held whenever there is a large volume of items, or for other specialty</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reasons), sealed bid (written bids must be at a certain location by a certain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>date), open bid (potential buyers may use publicly posted forms), quick</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(perhaps the items for sale are perishable, or there are “large amounts of lowvalue</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise”) and consignment.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Department of the Treasury -- <B>( http://www.ustreas.gov/auctions/) </B>The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Customs Service is a branch of the Department of the Treasury so their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions are intertwined. The Treasury Department has a subscription service</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for citizens who are interested in knowing about their auctions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Government Auction Guidelines...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Auctions sell “as is” in almost all cases.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>All auctions have an inspection period. It ranges from a few hours before the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction to a week or two.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>All items must be paid for in full before they can be removed from the auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Cash is always accepted. Cashier’s checks and money orders are the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>preferred forms of payment. Some auctions, if run by a private company, will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>accept Visa, and Master Card. Always check with the auction to be safe.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The <B>National Auction Bulletin </B>at 800-327-2049 lists all kinds of auctions.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Start your creative juices flowing. What can you find that will bring the money</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to you? Let’s start with...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Connect allied businesses. </B>For example, many B &amp; B owners are full</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on weekends and during certain seasons but have vacancies at other times.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Network with B&amp;B owners and receive a referral fee for sending customers. Or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contract with them to auction their vacancies for a commission. Or you could</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buy the bed and breakfast space yourself at a very reduced price and resell it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the auctions. Guests at a B&amp;B will want to go to local attractions and you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can sell event tickets or arrange transportation or set up an customized</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eat-and-play-and-see plan of action. There are many possible opportunities for</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>multiple income streams.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Long term business success on the Net depends on diversification. Try not to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be dependent on a single source of income (i.e., all your eggs in one ebasket).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Visit <B>http://auctions.sitesell.com/ </B>for more information on how you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can reduce risk and effectively diversify your auction business.</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Regional items </B>-- Regional items can be very valuable. Almost everyone</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>has something in their area that is unique and exciting to people from other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>areas, yet ho-hum to the locals. For example a friend recently bought a signed</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Amish basket for $15 and was offered over $100 for it when she returned home</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to Washington state.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The South is famous for certain plants, such as magnolias and dogwoods,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>along with the rich tradition of the confederacy and the civil war. The West has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an entire frontier tradition with the fascinating history of pioneers, Indians and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wagon trains. The smart marketer will romanticize these traditions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is a “regional” product -- look at the price offered for a confederate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sword…</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=CivilWar.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/CivilWar.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Goods from other countries can be very profitable </B>-- Serena and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Willem went on a honeymoon to Ireland and Scotland. They were determined</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to leave their 9-5 jobs and create a business on the Internet. The problem was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that they didn’t have any particular interests that they thought were marketable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>-- until their trip. They returned home with fire in their eyes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>While visiting the wonderful countryside, they found small merchants offering</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goods that they thought were wonderful and began making deals along the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>way. The honeymoon became a business trip, as well as a life-changing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>experience.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They began on the auctions, offering an item here and there. With their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>success, they built a full-time business that they now run out of their home,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling jewelry, books, pub memorabilia, fabulous sweaters and family crests,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all from Ireland and Scotland.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another gentleman makes a six figure income by selling masks. He imports</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them from Africa, Asia and South America. Some are whimsical, many are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fierce but they always sell. If you know what you are doing, as he does, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profits are enormous. If you don’t, you can lose substantial amounts of money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Always start out v-e-r-y slowly if you sell anything that requires a large</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>investment from you.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Event tickets </B>-- Tickets are often hot sellers on auction sites.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Catalog sales from home </B>-- There are some wonderful companies that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will sell you items at reduced prices, drop ship for you and have catalogs that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can use yourself by merely adding your own name.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Examples are Specialty Merchandise Corporation, 9401 De Soto Avenue,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Chatsworth, CA, 01311, 888-990-7468 or the Mellinger Company, PO Box</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>596, Santa Clarita, CA, 91380-9056.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you look in business opportunity magazines, you will find others. Observe</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some <B>caution </B>with these... some of these kinds of businesses are franchises</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with major fees involved. Others don’t call themselves franchises but they are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anyway.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Collectibles are a gigantic business </B>-- Collectibles are hot, hot items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In fact, if you absolutely have no category interests whatsoever, this is a very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>strong </B>category to latch onto. There are sites that are worth studying because</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they will help you to discern the current frenzies...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.nationaltvbargains.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Sell hard-to-come-by merchandise </B>-- Items that are very rare usually</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell quite well indeed. Watch for limited editions or custom-made products.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As I said before, <B>uniqueness sells!</B></FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Passion Rules!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are some very smart auction folks out there. These people have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>researched their interests, found objects they love and learned how to make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money by following their passion. We can study and learn from them…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Be creative with clothing </B>-- Clothing is a strong seller on some of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction sites, and certainly lends itself to a lot of creativity. It is easy to buy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clothing for very, very low prices and jazz it up to become quite an interesting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The auction sites themselves are a great source of supplies for folks who love</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to personalize clothes. For example, old buttons from the 1890’s have a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>listing…</FONT>&nbsp;
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The same seller offered 5 pounds of Victorian buttons. Look at the price for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>these little beauties…</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Buttons.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Buttons.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Sell tools </B>-- A retired carpenter with a fascination for tools, discovered a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>source for tool boxes where he could buy them very cheaply. He then auctions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the boxes and receives a high profit. He often includes specialized tools with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the box. Or he will create a collection for special people. For example, he has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one collection that is for the newbie homeowner or a teenager just getting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>started with tools. The seller has a collection for anyone who wants to build</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wooden furniture. He also auctions gift certificates for his special collection.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Make ordinary items special </B>-- One woman of my acquaintance has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>found a great buying source for inexpensive bed trays. She decorates and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>personalizes many of them while others are sold as is. She also discovered a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>source for marble paper towel holders.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Turn your hobby into money </B>-- One successful seller has a mania for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>teapots. Since she is a smart marketer, she always includes small “extras” with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>her pots... recipes for various teas or cookies, instructions on how to stage a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“high tea” party for your friends, a tiny sample of a unique jelly to put on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>scones, pictures of what the well-dressed woman will wear to a tea, how to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make flavored honeys, or directions for making a tea cozy.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This bright lady illustrates a very important and lucrative idea. It takes very little</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>imagination or creativity to make your items really special. Just add small</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>touches such as these that will delight your audience and make you and your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products memorable. Every seller can go this extra mile, no matter what your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>product.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Outdoor equipment is popular </B>-- One seller who loves the outdoors</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>began by specializing in all kinds of tents. These sold so well that he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expanded his inventory to include all kinds of camping gear, and then added</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fishing and hunting equipment. When you buy one of his products, you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>offered a free subscription to his electronic newsletter. He regales the reader</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with stories of fishing trips, hunting trips, climbing mountains and other such</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>outdoorsy stuff. This seller is a perfect example of someone who has found a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>way to make money (lots of money) by following his passion.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is an example of a seller who understands the power of handmade</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items…</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Stick.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Stick.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The description is clear and the benefits are clearly stated.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Camping equipment is very popular on the auction sites... in the <B>warm</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>months</B>. The power of seasonal attention comes into play. Identify what you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are going to do in the “off-season” to compensate.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Become a specialist in children’s items </B>-- If you are interested in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>children’s items, here is something important to keep in mind. Otherwise</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sensible people will spend <B>incredible </B>amounts of money on goodies for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>children... money they would never spend on themselves.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Advertising signs are popular </B>-- Grant makes almost all of his money</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>off advertisement-related items. He sells tin signs which could advertise Coca</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Cola, Volkswagen, Route 66, Genuine Ford Parts and Shell Premium Gas. As</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>well Grant has older companies like Ronco and Dr. Bruner’s Miracle Tonic.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of his signs are reproductions but he also sells lots of genuine antiques.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He finds these by poking around antique stores and flea markets and making</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contacts along the way. Poking around can be profitable!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Bath items are always in season </B>-- Another smart lady, whom I have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dubbed the “Boudoir Babe,” specializes in bath items that pamper her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers. Some of her best sellers are eye masks. She also sells a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>package that usually includes a stainless steel back brush, a loofah bath mitt</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and a long loofah back scrubber.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is a perfect example of the power of “bundling” items. Boudoir Babe</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>keeps careful records and insists that she almost doubles her profits by selling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them this way. For example, she has five items that normally sell for $5 - $7</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>each. If she groups them under a romantic name, they usually sell for $50 -</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$60. <B>Same items. More profit. </B>Less trouble because she ships several</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items to one person.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Value-bundling gives the customer the great feeling of getting something for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>nothing. Products that have a logical association with one another are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>grouped together and one price is set for the combination.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Value-bundling is a powerful method if the price of your bundle equals the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>price of the <B>most expensive </B>component. Customers are willing to pay that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much for just that single item so, in their minds, the rest of the bundle is simply</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a delightful bonus.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) </B>Specialize in linens -- There are towels, great looking fabric shower</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>curtains, bedspreads, even sheets that are successfully sold on auctions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some sellers add lace, embroidery, appliqué and fabric paint to make one-ofa-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>kind items that sell for a premium.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is an example of a smart way to sell your merchandise. The seller is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling this canvas shower curtain...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The birds on the curtain are embroidered. She has a close up of the bird itself</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>so that her customers can appreciate the details…</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Bird.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Bird.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>10) Pick up seasonal merchandise </B>-- There are smart folks who enjoy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shopping and don’t mind storing items. After a season or holiday is over, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unsold items can be bought for almost nothing because the stores simply want</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to unload them. If you don’t mind waiting for your profits, buy large quantities of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>these. If you regularly do this, you will have profits coming in year round</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because there is always a different occasion looming on the horizon.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>11) Sports memorabilia and cards have a large following </B>-- I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>assumed that most of this memorabilia was vast in quantity but low in price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Well, “it ain’t necessarily so!” Here are some of the pricey items for sale... a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>signed baseball from the 300 Win Club at $400, a picture of Sandy Kofax at</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$2750 and a bat signed by the 1986 New York Mets at $775</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>12) Outdoor activities need equipment </B>-- Rachel auctions mountain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>climbing gear and she uses a great marketing tool --herself. Rachel’s ads all</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>include really colorful pictures of herself, her friends, campfires, great scenery,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the first flower poking its head through the snow and so on. Everyone who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buys something from her automatically receives her very colorful newsletter,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unless they opt not to. And why should they? They’re all mountain climbers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>themselves or at least they fantasize that they are.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>13) Buy food in bulk </B>-- I have a favorite supplier who sells food in bulk</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>( http://www.bulkfoods.com/) . </B>One day, I received an e-mail from Tallie.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>She had been offering dried apricots for sale, without much success. She</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>studied my ads and began copying them. She wrote to thank me for the ideas.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What did I do differently? I offered all kinds of ways to use these food products.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, I had a wonderful salad at a Houlihan’s restaurant which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contained dried cherries. I got a take-home version and included all the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ingredients. A picture finished off my ad. I have also offered recipes for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sugarless muffins and jams made with dried fruit (nice appeal for the weight</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>conscious).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What does all this add up to? <B>Spinoffs. </B>Use your imagination and be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>creative. So many possibilities come to mind... how about creating gift baskets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>filled with product? Or pictures of the items in really pretty bowls or jars. Then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell the bowls and jars, too. Make a cookbook full of healthy recipes. Or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>develop a special edition for diabetics or for weight loss. <B>Diversification </B>in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>action, once again! See <B>http://auctions.sitesell.com/ </B>and find out how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Site Build It! </B>can help you generate traffic and then monetize that traffic</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profitably.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>14) </B>Concentrate on TV products -- The discount on these usually isn’t very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>high, even to wholesalers, so your profit per item may not be great.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Nevertheless, they are usually very easy to sell.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Yellow caution light ahead... just be aware that where the money goes, <B>the</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>chain stores follow. </B>Even if the auctioneer sells a huge number of this kind</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of item, many of her buyers will be very unhappy when they see this lower</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>price elsewhere.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>The Joy of Drop Shipping</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many auction sellers are surprised to find out they can sell merchandise they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t own, may never see and best of all, definitely don’t have to ship. There</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are many companies who will <B>drop ship </B>items for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What exactly is “drop ship”?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is a sales strategy used by many businesses, especially small companies.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These are often the companies who can’t afford ads on the Super Bowl or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>infomercials that run several times a day. They don’t have a large sales staff</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and they can’t afford large spreads in national magazines. Therefore, they will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell merchandise at reduced prices to small buyers like us. We act as their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unofficial sales people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s a win-win situation. The company sells more merchandise than they could</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ordinarily sell. Your Net auction business wins because…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>You don’t have any financial <B>investment </B>in the goods you are selling. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the merchandise sells on the auction you receive payment from your buyer and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>send part of the money to the company. Most of them will mail to your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customer with your mailing label on the box. If the merchandise doesn’t sell,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you have not risked your money and have no capital tied up in merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>You do not need to bother with the <B>shipping and handling </B>of these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items. You are free to pursue your real love -- finding exciting and salable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goods.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Many of these companies have professionally created <B>catalogs and/or</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>pictures </B>that you can use on your auction site. The quality may exceed that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>which you can achieve with your own camera or scanner.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>There are <B>no goods to store. </B>This can be a huge advantage. My dining</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>room often looks like a warehouse, piled high with merchandise and tape,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>labels, bubble wrap, etc. Entrepreneurs who have had cases of products from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>MLM companies stacked in the garage will be especially appreciative of this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bonus!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) </B>This works best with <B>higher-priced </B>items. If you are going to sell 50</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>widgets at $2 each, you are either going to have to take possession of them</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and mail them yourself, or you are going to have to pay a gruesomely</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive shipping charge to your supplier.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are ways to create your own sources. All it takes is know-how and some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>effort…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Use catalogs </B>-- This is the very best way to find companies willing to drop</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ship for you. Get on the mailing lists of every catalog you can find in your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chosen niche! Do this even if you aren’t interested in drop shipping because it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will help keep you informed about your merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are some fine catalog directories. Your local library may have one or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more of them, or you can buy them yourself. While some are expensive, others</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are relatively modest in cost. Here are some of the best...</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>Quebec, J3L 4B3, 514-658-6205</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another way to find catalogs is to read magazines in your field of interest.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There will be all kinds of merchandise and catalogs advertised in their pages.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Not only will the catalogs give you ideas about product and what is hot but you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can often find bargains. Many catalogs have occasional “clearance” issues</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that can be immensely profitable. There is <B>no risk </B>with these kinds of items</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because you have them sold <B>before </B>your order them from the company.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Create your own sources </B>-- This is a very lucrative technique! Almost</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>no one realizes that it is possible to create your own sources of merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Go on a…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… source-hunting safari! </B>Just because a company doesn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advertise that they drop ship doesn’t mean they won’t do it. The worst they can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>do is say no, in which case you are no worse off than you were before.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps a company has just never thought about it!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Begin prowling the large chain stores, looking for items that are intriguing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you find them, check the packaging and investigate the manufacturer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A MicroSoft or Procter and Gamble product? Put it back on the shelf and keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>looking. Huge companies like that aren’t going to make a deal with an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>individual auction seller. But when you find something that says, “Bob’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Garage” in Tickfaw, Louisiana, make a note of the address. This may be the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>exact item you are looking for because Bob may be very willing to drop ship</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this item for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The margin of profit that a manufacturer receives from a chain store is very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>slight. During a discussion with a WalMart employee, I was astonished to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>discover that on a $3.99 item, the manufacturer made less than 40 cents. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>might be able to offer Bob much more than he would make selling to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chains. Even if you can’t do that, you represent extra business. Why would he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>turn you down? You might be able to make quite a deal, especially if you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>going to do a Dutch auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I got this idea when I read an article in one of my favorite newsletters which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>described a gentleman who found an intriguing device in the automotive</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>section at WalMart. It was a small tool that sharpened windshield-wiper blades</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>so that they lasted longer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He bought the item in the store for a few dollars. Then he contacted the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>company who agreed to sell them to him at half-price and drop ship them as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>well.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This smart man sent out a few press releases and managed to get a small</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>write-up in “Popular Mechanics” magazine. He immediately made $7,000+ in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profit on this small item, and orders trickled in for quite some time afterwards.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If I had known him personally, I would have suggested that he use this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>valuable publicity to create a sensation on all of the Internet auction sites. His</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>headline could have included, “As seen in Popular Mechanics...”. This <B>crosspromotion</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would have added greatly to his bottom line.</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I have used this search-and-find method many times...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>TV trays and picture frames discovered at “Bed, Bath and Beyond.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Garden ornaments discovered at “Home Depot.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>A wonderful journal with unusual pictures on the cover, discovered at</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“Borders” bookstore.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>A great money-maker was a galvanized metal outdoor thermometer that sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at “Target” for $14.99. The manufacturer was willing to drop ship it for $6.74. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>had three different Dutch auctions with this item. It sold for $9.99, $10.05 and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$12.20. I made over $1100.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The most important rule to remember when looking for sources? <B>Be a good</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>detective and…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>...keep your eyes open. </B>I went hunting with a friend who is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new to the auction game. We went to only two stores and emerged with a list</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of <B>61 </B>possibilities! Fellow auction fanatics all discover merchandise by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>snooping through large stores. Major furniture stores are good sources for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>finding lamps, baskets and other decorative items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The key is to look for merchandise that is <B>unusual, unique, different, etc.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Remember, someone will buy your item if the price is really outstanding or if it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cannot easily be found elsewhere.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Heavier items are a natural for drop shipping because they are such a pain to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mail. Everyday, china is successfully sold on auctions. Of course, fancy,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive and/or rare china sells well but there can be a lot of profit in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ordinary, too. Plates, bowls and mugs can all be found at low prices.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Find businesses that don’t know how to market </B>-- There are s-o-o-o</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many people who create a business without giving a thought to marketing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When the light dawns, and they realize they have no customers, they are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merely resentful and annoyed about the whole thing. These kinds of people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can be our natural partners to the benefit of us all.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Lucky Jon stumbled across a family with a small, not-very-profitable business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>making tables that really are works of art. Jon sells this fabulous furniture and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the family happily ships to the lucky buyer. The table-makers are thrilled</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because their business has dramatically increased.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This seller used a tactic that can be quite valuable. Sometimes it is possible to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>create a <B>contractual relationship </B>with the producer of a great product. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can sign an agreement that will gain you exclusive marketing rights for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>product. Usually, these agreements are dependent upon a certain number of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sales. They often have a time limit, and/or are renewable for a certain number</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of years.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some auction learners wonder why the producer doesn’t do it themselves.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes the producer tries to change his mind once he understands how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lucrative it can be. An exclusive marketing rights agreement is a way to protect</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yourself.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are some really silly Drop Ship Directories that circulate around the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Internet and home business magazines. I have bought several of them and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have found them to be quite useless. There are usually a couple of companies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that are worthwhile but not many. Develop your own sources!</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To truly show the power of this strategy, let’s look at an item I have auctioned</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>repeatedly, the Torso Track and Torso Track II. I located a source for these two</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>exercise machines and got the pictures for my listings right off my supplier’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Web site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Did I do well? Well, the profit per item isn’t anything fabulous. I made between</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$20 - $35 per sale. And I sold 10 – 20 of these per month. So my monthly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>income from this one item was between $200 - $700 per month. Nothing to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make anyone rich, right?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But here are the important points...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>I didn’t ship anything! My distributor handled all that for me and I didn’t have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to bother with it at all.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>The company guaranteed it for 30 days so I didn’t have to concern myself</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with that part, either.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>I risked no money at all, except for the fee that I paid eBay for my listing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The great part was that most of my customers paid me through PayPal. So</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>when I received their money, I paid my supplier out of the same PayPal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>account and just kept the extra for myself.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) </B>It was so convenient and quick. I ordered my customer’s Torso Track right</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>online. There was an account sheet that was created especially for me,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>complete with ID and password so that no one else could access it. I then sent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an e-mail copy of the order to my customer so that they felt comfortable that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they would soon receive their merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>v) </B>There was no extra work to repeat the auction indefinitely. I spent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>approximately half an hour creating an ad, and I just re-submitted the same ad,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>again and again.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you see the power of locating your own sources? And how did I find my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>supplier? I just wrote and asked if I could sell their products wholesale. When</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you find something you want to sell, locate as many sources as you can and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>write to all of them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Why write to several? Some will say no, or have a minimum number of orders,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or not respond at all. But even if you are turned down, are you any worse off</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>than you were? On the positive flip side, several companies will agree and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you want to find the best price that you can.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>An insight that needs repeating… <B>I never use a supplier without first</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>buying something myself. </B>You do <B>not </B>want to sell something and then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have trouble with your customers because the merchandise doesn’t get</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shipped!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this case, my source said I would receive my merchandise in 8 – 10 days. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wrote the order date on my calendar and kept track of the delivery time which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>was exactly eight days, just like they said.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This chapter basically dealt with auction items of a more general nature. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>emphasis was on propelling your auction business forward quickly. <B>Lowerpriced</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>items attract more potential buyers faster. </B>So by using the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strategies outlined above, you can easily increase your auction experience</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and build your business at the same time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now it’s time to remove the wide-angle lens and examine other equally</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profitable directions that your Net auction business could take. We’ll start witha very <B>creative </B>option… </FONT>
