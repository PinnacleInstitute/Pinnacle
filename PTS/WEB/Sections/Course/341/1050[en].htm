<B><FONT size=4>What Do YOU Want?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To succeed at the <B>Net Auction Game, </B>you must be clear about what you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want from it and what you are willing to do to obtain your goals. A method of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>evaluation is critical as well -- although the money we make, or don’t make,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certainly provides a lot of feedback.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once again the best way to understand the “big picture” is to ask the <B>right</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>questions! </B>Don’t worry. No grades. No tests. This is simply an effective way</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to help your Net auction business reach its <B>full </B>potential. Questions are a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>critical element of success.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So many times, <B>I have just danced lightheartedly into projects with…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… pictures of possible scenarios floating in my head.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Not really thinking about the consequences. I have always been sorry.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It slowly dawned on me that it is much easier to get into something than get out</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of it. The more time I spend in <B>advance, </B>figuring out what will be expected of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>me, looking for flaws, examining my expectations, the more success I have.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This may not be a universal law but it sure seems close!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Big Picture Focus Questions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Fortunately, you have already been reflecting on these questions. Try to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>finalize your answers now…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>How much <B>money </B>would you like to make in a month’s time? Do you want</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to make an extra few hundred dollars in order to make a car payment or pay</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the mortgage? Or would you like to quit your job and make this a full-time</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business? Are you ambitious enough to want to become one of the Internet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>millionaires we all read about?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>How much <B>time </B>do you have to devote to auctions? Be realistic. <B>There</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>are only 24 hours in a day…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… no matter how hard you try to squeeze in one more.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you can only manage thirty minutes a day for your auction business, or five</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hours on weekends, then don’t see yourself making zillions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Know your limits. You may want this to be a full-time job but you can’t afford to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>quit that job right now. So focus on the here-and-now, not the future.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Recognize that if you only have two hours a week, it is unrealistic to believe</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that you can auction hundreds of items.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>What is a realistic <B>time frame </B>for this project? Are you ready to start a Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction business today, or will you need some time to convince your spouse</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that this is a good idea? Will it be a couple of months before you can start</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cleaning out that garage or are you heading out the door with broom-in-hand</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>after this sentence? Do you have a couple of other projects you need to finish</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>first?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Do you already know what kind of merchandise you would like to specialize</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in, or are you unclear at this time? If you have collected something for the past</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>thirty years then perhaps your choices are already made. If you haven’t the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>faintest clue, then have you done the necessary category research?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) </B>Is there something that you already know a lot about, or will you have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>start from zero? If you are already an expert on antique maps, great! If not,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what is your learning curve? Have you chosen an area that requires great</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expertise, or can you learn about it quickly?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) </B>What knowledge do you need? Do you know when you have discovered a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargain? Do you know what to charge for your items? Do you know where to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>get what you want to sell?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) </B>If you don’t have the information you need, do you know <B>where </B>to get it?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) </B>Can you find out whatever you need to know without taking any big risks? If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you need to take a $5,000 real estate course <B>and have to carry home...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... a back-breaking load of books to read </B>in order to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>adequately understand your field, then I suggest beginning with an easier</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>category. Come back to real estate when you have a little experience. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction game is not about taking huge risks!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) </B>What skills will you need? One of the greatest things about this business is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that it isn’t extremely complicated and/or difficult. Yet there is a certain amount</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of discipline and effort required, just like anything else in life. Truthfully, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>most necessary skills for positive Net auctions are <B>persistence </B>and a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>willingness </B>to learn from every failure as well as every success.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>10) </B>If there are skills you don’t have, can you either acquire them or hire</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone to do them for you? Be honest with yourself. Some qualities come</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from within and cannot be bought at any price. However, many others can be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>acquired or hired.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>11) </B>How do you feel about shopping? Do you love going through <B>huge</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>stacks of goods or would you rather…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… get in a boxing ring with Mike Tyson?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I get the shudders at the thought of going to yard sales or plowing through</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“stuff” at the Salvation Army store. More than fifteen minutes at the mall gives</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>me hives. But I have friends whose idea of an ideal day is to get in the car at</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dawn and return at nightfall with their trunks loaded. Which style reflects you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more closely?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>12) </B>Would you prefer to sell a few high-ticket items, or would you rather have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dozens of smaller items for sale? We will discuss this in detail later on in this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chapter but it is much easier to begin with smaller, less expensive items.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>13) </B>Are you comfortable talking to strangers or would you rather deal only with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“faceless” people on a computer screen? If you are negotiating only with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dealers and/or stores who stock your merchandise, you can conduct business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by phone, e-mail or fax. If you are going to flea markets and such, you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>going to have to talk with people face-to-face in order to buy their merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>14) </B>Do you live in a large city where a lot of merchandise is easily available or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will location be a problem? You can live anywhere that has electricity and run</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your auction business! Whether merchandise is geographically convenient</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>matters only if you are planning to specialize in certain fields.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>15) </B>What obstacles are you likely to encounter? When obstacles inevitably</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appear, how are you going to handle them?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I have set up my auction business so that the worst that can happen to me is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that I will lose some relatively small sums of money and a few hours of my time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can create the same kind of scenario for yourself. However, your personal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>situation may be such that <B>you are in a …</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… rat race with obstacles nipping at your heels.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps your spouse thinks that auctions are ridiculous, or your parents urge</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you to get a “real job.” How are you going to handle them?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>16) </B>Am I going to learn from my inevitable mistakes, or am I going to whine</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about them? In one sense, the auctions are a very basic, primal kind of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. Either an item sells or it doesn’t! If it doesn’t, are you willing to work</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on figuring out why not?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>17) </B>Am I willing to persist until I succeed? Or is there a significant chance that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I will just give up? If you think you are going to give up, then be especially</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>careful to invest very little money in merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>18) </B>Does a Net auction business <B>sing to you?…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… or is it just a little tweet? </B>Are you really interested in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this? Is it just for the money? Don’t misunderstand me. There is nothing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wrong with going after money. It’s just hard to maintain enthusiasm if you don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enjoy your work.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>19) </B>What are the possible rewards? While I love the money, I love the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>freedom just as much or more. I am fascinated by the people that I meet and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the merchandise that I find. I feel a real thrill of discovery when I successfully</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>carry something off. What do you want? What are you expecting to happen?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>20) </B>What do you like about auctions?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>21) </B>What do you dislike about auctions? Of course, we never really know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>something until we do it. But based on what you currently know, what are your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>preferences? Are the likes <B>stronger </B>than the dislikes or vice versa?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you know the answers to all those questions from above? If you do, I am</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>amazed. It took me quite a while to answer them for myself. This is the same</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>set of questions that I always ask when I take on a <B>new project. </B>Use them for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anything that you do. I guarantee they will be helpful.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of them seem pretty ridiculous right now, don’t they? For instance, how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can you know if you will like auctions until you have done a few? And how can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you tell what you like and dislike if you’ve never tried it?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Focus questions </B>are designed to get you thinking clearly and deeply. Did</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you ever try focused reading experiments in school? In the <B>first part of the</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>experiment...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... you read story A and then answer questions. </B>For the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>second part, you read story B after you see a set of questions about it. Now</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you know what to look for as you read. The result? You get more correct</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>answers on story B.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Use the focus questions outlined above to get positive results for your Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction business. Now is the time to pour a <B>rock-solid </B>foundation.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So why did we wait until now to present the focus questions? Up until now,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you were learning the “how-to” of maneuvering around auction sites. Now you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are getting into the creative part, the actual <B>how-to-make-money part.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are lots of stories about people making huge profits and having a ball on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the auction sites. But those are their stories. You have to create your <B>own</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pathways and no one can or should do that for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Even if you read that Susie-Q is doing such and such and you want to copy her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>exactly, you can be sure of one thing -- your projects won’t be like hers. That is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what makes us individuals. That is what makes an auction business fun.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Refer to these focus questions and review them periodically. Stay on track...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>the right track!</FONT></B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>The Right Track</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s not always easy to recognize when you are going off course. You need</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some guide posts to provide direction. For an income-generating auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business, look for these markers...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• High Profit Potential </B>-- If what you are selling doesn’t allow you to make a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>substantial profit, you might question whether it is worth doing. Granted, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will need to test anything and everything you want to sell, and your profit may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be small at first. And to complicate things further, your definition of “substantial”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may be different from mine. But if your goal is to <B>maximize </B>your money while</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>minimizing </B>your time (and it certainly ought to be), you need to constantly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>evaluate what you are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, an auctioneer recently sold a computer part for $136.25. He paid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$130 for it and he spent over an hour writing the ad. Not a great return for his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time. If this low profit margin continues, the auctioneer needs to rethink his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strategy and sell something more profitable.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Low Risk </B>-- The auction business is by its very nature low risk. If you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spending more money than you anticipated, it’s a sign that something needs to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>change.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Easy Marketing </B>-- Marketing concerns are minimal if you...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Research and choose the most profitable/in-demand merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Master effective marketing skills. If your products are not selling, this is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>where you need to look. There are no other variables.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Fun </B>-- You may think that having fun is frivolous, something you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dispense with. <B>After all, making money requires...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... serious thinking! </B>But you are wrong! Those people who don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enjoy what they are doing usually don’t have the stamina to stick it out, to learn</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their craft.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I built a business from scratch, one in which I was making more than $100,000</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>per year -- and I did it in less than a year’s time. I woke up one morning with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the realization that I absolutely hated what I was doing even though I was an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>entrepreneur and my own boss. I realized that my reasons for starting my</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business weren’t carefully considered, and that I just needed to make money in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a hurry. I quit that business immediately.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, I completed everything that was currently in process but I sought no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>new business and instead started doing the work of figuring out what I really</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wanted... in spite of all the well-meaning people who assured me that I was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>nuts to walk away from a profitable business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I had some lean times, very lean times, before I figured out what I wanted to do.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If I had asked myself some tough questions in advance, none of that would</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have been necessary.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What’s the point of this personal saga? There are two actually... the first is to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>emphasize the <B>importance </B>of the focus questions. Do your thinking before</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the fact rather than after. The second point is to <B>“reframe” that dreaded</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>word...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... mistake.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In most of our cultures, we are taught from our earliest childhood days to dread</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and despise mistakes. All too often, when we make a mistake we feel shame.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We feel that there is something wrong with us. If there wasn’t, how could we</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have done something so stupid?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As I said earlier, I invite you to see mistakes as merely a necessary part of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>learning. Make your learning process as enjoyable as possible. Consider</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>each experience as a lesson and a way to get feedback on your actions. Live</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and learn. <B>Analyze </B>rather than judge yourself. Have <B>fun.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Make a plan that fits with your passion, take action and be positive to feedback.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A perfect formula for success!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Two Basic Selling Strategies</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you want your auction business to make lots and lots of money, there are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>only two possible strategies...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) Specialize in smaller profit items, and sell a lot of them.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) Sell a few large items.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you sell a Porsche, it is easy to make $1000 in profit. If you are selling $10</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>books, you need to sell 100 of them to make the same amount of money. Of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>course, you can use a combination of these methods. For example, you might</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to sell trucks, books about trucks and toy trucks.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Like everything else in life, each strategy has its <B>advantages </B>and <B>pitfalls...</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Fewer items mean simpler choices. Choosing to sell expensive items narrows</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your choices immediately. There is only a relatively small handful of items that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can gross thousands of dollars in profits -- vehicles, art by famous people,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive jewelry and so forth. By contrast, there are thousands and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>thousands of inexpensive items to choose from.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>More expensive items require more <B>specialized </B>knowledge. Generally,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>those who sell the more expensive items need greater knowledge. I don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to know much to sell Star Wars posters. A valuable painting is a whole</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>different ball game.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Inexpensive items reduce risk. If my $10 book doesn’t sell, it is an annoyance.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If I have bought a $10,000 piece of equipment and don’t sell it, that can be a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>financial disaster! There is a safer way to auction expensive items, and we will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>discuss that approach in detail in later chapters. Briefly, it involves selling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goods that belong to others for a fee, and not assuming financial risk of your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>own.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Expensive deals become more critical. Each deal becomes <B>much more...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... sweat-inducing </B>if you are working with larger numbers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Obviously, there are fewer of those kinds of transactions than there are the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>smaller priced ones. It is much like commercial real estate. Each deal is much</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more lucrative but there may be twenty successful residential closings for every</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>commercial one.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can begin more <B>quickly </B>with inexpensive items. It is harder to get started</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with bigger money deals. And this isn’t only because of the increased</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>knowledge that you must have. It is often harder to find those opportunities</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>than smaller ones. Also, once you get a reputation for successfully selling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain kinds of goods, you will have people seeking you out. But at first, no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one knows who you are and no one has any reason to believe a word that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>say.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Fewer transactions mean less record keeping. Larger items usually mean no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shipping and handling. You can almost, or entirely, eliminate shipping and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>handling when you are dealing with large items. Those folks who buy a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Lamborgini are going to come pick it up themselves. No <B>UPS </B>for them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Cheaper items mean a much larger audience. You have a much greater</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>audience if you are selling lower priced items. Nevertheless, this doesn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mean that there aren’t lots of folks who want to buy expensive items...</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>A Preview of What’s Ahead</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The next five chapters detail various money-making methods. Some ideas will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>overlap and/or fit into more than one category. What should be your main</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>objective for the rest of this book? Find ideas that excite you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you feel fairly confident about where you want to go, feel free to skip to that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chapter right now so you can get started sooner. Then come back and read</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the others later. Ideas are like plants. They <B>cross-fertilize, </B>if we let them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So let’s see what’s ahead...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 14 </B>-- <B>Start Generating Profits</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 14 </B>reveals the first major way to generate profits... <B>sell your own</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>goods.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most people start their auction businesses by cleaning out their attics and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>garages, selling off the accumulation of “stuff” that they have. But then once</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your home treasures are gone, what do you sell? You’ve now got auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fever.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The easiest way to find goods is to start haunting garage sales, flea markets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and the like. These are just the most obvious ways to find products, however.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are so many more possibilities.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For instance, what about selling merchandise that isn’t in your possession, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may never see and you definitely don’t have to ship? (Sounds very appealing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to me!) And the coolest thing about this is that there is absolutely no risk! After</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the merchandise is bought, you order it with the money you receive from your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>MYNAS! </B>is filled with stories of “ordinary” people who have realized their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goals on the auction sites and then gone on to set even greater goals. Where</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>did I get these stories?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Many of them are friends and acquaintances that live in my city. Others are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people I have met on the Internet, in chat rooms or on auction sites. Some of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>these I have met in person. Others are friends I have never seen and most</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>likely never will.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In other cases, I have seen interesting sellers on the sites and written to them. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>explained what I was doing and asked them to tell me about themselves. We</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all like stories. Knowing that other people, just like ourselves, are succeeding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is very empowering. I would like to share a short e-mail I received from a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>former buyer named Tony...</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3>Hi Sydney! 
<BR>Remember me? You sold me the Stefanchik course on eBay. 
<BR>Well I got a few good ideas from him and have definitely 
<BR>improved my business!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Isn’t that great? Of course, the money is cool but helping others is truly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>satisfying!</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 15 </B>-- <B>Stand Out With Unique Items</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are all kinds of reasons why people shop on the Internet, but one of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strongest is because the Net offers unique items. <B>Chapter 15 </B>honors the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many talented and creative people who want to <B>express themselves...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... by creating beautiful and different items.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are an increasing number of home businesses being started by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>craftspeople... people who take pride in their work... who do what they do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because they can’t help it... who see themselves as more than an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interchangeable part in a corporate machine... who simply must express</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>themselves or endure lives of frustration.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do you have something you would like to do, something you want to create?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Or do you know people who feel this way but know nothing about marketing or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how to sell their products?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 16 </B>-- <B>Sell Goods You Don’t Own</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For the most part, Chapters 14 and 15 concern themselves with the high</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>volume sellers -- those who choose to sell lots of smaller-priced items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In <B>Chapter 16 , </B>we concentrate on those who would prefer to sell fewer and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>larger profit items. These bigger ticket items are usually such things as cars,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>industrial equipment, airplanes and the like.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Even though it seems hard to believe, there are millions and millions of people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who don’t own a computer, or aren’t on the Internet yet (imagine that!), or know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>nothing about auctions. And they don’t want to learn either.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I can guarantee you that there are people very near you who can’t dispose of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some large ticket items and don’t know what to do. <B>They are...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... frustrated and discouraged. </B>You have an opportunity to be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their white knight. After all, someone sold an $8,000,000 hotel on an auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site so the possibilities are as vast as your imagination.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 17 </B>-- <B>Promote Your Business</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 17 </B>is for those folks who have their own business (or want to be their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>own boss). Don’t be alarmed by this. We’re not talking about the owner of an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>office building with 200 employees.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We’re talking about... <B>You!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If your office is in your basement or spare bedroom, and you are the CEO,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receptionist, marketing director, accountant, sales staff and janitorial service of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your small business, you have come to the right place.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, larger businesses use auctions too but mostly it is the e-playground</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the entrepreneur, the owner of the one-person or family business (Small</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Small Businesses -- SSBs).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And when you add <B>Site Build It! </B>to your marketing toolbox, your small</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business will flourish. <B>Site Build It! </B>will help you harness the power of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Net to attract more potential buyers. And then you can monetize this traffic by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>introducing other streams of income off your Web site to complement your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction selling.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 18 </B>-- <B>Learn from the Pros</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I have learned the auction business through my own experiences, and by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>observing what my fellow auction sellers are doing. <B>Chapter 18 </B>shows you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some really great listings... and some really awful ones. Keep in mind that the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>terrible ones can be just as valuable as the superior ones. If we know what not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to do, we can avoid costly mistakes.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 19 </B>-- <B>Where to Sell Your Goods</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you want to maximize your returns, you need to choose carefully where you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sell your goods. <B>Chapter 19 </B>gives you the criteria to help you in your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decision-making and suggests some potential sites.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Chapter 20 </B>– <B>The Wrap-Up</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And then there is “The Wrap Up,” <B>Chapter 20. </B>Its content reflects its title!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The most common way to get into the auction game, but definitely not the only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>way, is to sell products you already own, or that you can acquire for a low price. 
<BR>So let’s use that as our launch pad to begin a truly remarkable and excitingbusiness venture...</FONT>
