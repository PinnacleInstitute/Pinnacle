<B><FONT size=4>Introduction</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Like so many others, I stumbled into the Net auction business by accident. I 
<BR>had heard about them and decided to see what all of the hullabaloo was 
<BR>about. So I bought a couple of things and had a marvelous time. Even at that 
<BR>point, I could see the profit potential of Net auctions. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Searching for this information myself, I discovered only two kinds of material 
<BR>were available… 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>1) Read and Guess... </B>You can find a few quite good auction books on 
<BR><B>eBay. </B>Unfortunately, they don’t tell you exactly how to make money. There is 
<BR>a lot of talk that goes, “Get some merchandise to sell, and then...” Isn’t that the 
<BR>problem? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>What merchandise? Where do I get it? What kind should I get? Do I buy it and 
<BR>hope, or can I know in advance that it will sell? What do I charge? The list of 
<BR>questions goes on and on. And the answers get harder and harder to find. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>2) Get-Rich-Overnight... </B>There is the ever-floating foolishness that 
<BR>“guarantees that within two weeks you will be making $50,000 a month with 
<BR>your auction business.” There are CDs that promise to give you a list of 
<BR>1,000,000 places to buy merchandise. However, when you call or write to their 
<BR>sources, they’re all out of business. Neither type of material is <B>productive </B>-  
<BR>unless you are cultivating frustration. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>A favorite marketing word is “secret” -  a neuron-charging word that tingles 
<BR>your brain. Suddenly, a picture pops into your mind of someone <B>whispering</B> 
<BR><B>in your ear…</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>… “I know a secret </B>and I will share it with you if you pay me a 
<BR>whole lot of money.” 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Guess what? <B>There aren’t any secrets in Net auctions.</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Of course, like anything in life, you must <B>master </B>the basics and <B>understand</B> 
<BR>what you are doing. This is true if you are picking up trash or creating secret 
<BR>weapons for the Pentagon. No successful business, online or offline, happens 
<BR>by accident. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>This book will provide you with usable and do-able information and ideas. You 
<BR>get everything you need to know to carry out successful auctions, <B>how to…</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>write powerful ads and listings 
<BR><B>• </B>figure out your costs so that you sell at a profit 
<BR><B>• </B>master record keeping 
<BR><B>• </B>arrange shipping and handling 
<BR><B>• </B>accept payment 
<BR><B>• </B>build traffic 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>You also get information regarding…</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>suppliers and auction sites 
<BR><B>• </B>money-making ideas 
<BR><B>• </B>how to avoid mistakes that cut into your profits 
<BR><B>• </B>studies of successful sellers that are making huge sums of money 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>Bottom line?</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>I can promise you that you have the information to do whatever you want with 
<BR>auctions. Keep in mind that <B>this is an art, not a science. </B>And isn’t that for 
<BR>the best? By developing our own skills and abilities, we become the kind of 
<BR>wealthy and successful people we all want to be. Knowledge is only 
<BR><B>potential </B>power -  without action, it is useless. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>So if you want to become a master of the auction game, get in there and 
<BR><B>experiment. </B>You will learn, make new friends, earn some money, create 
<BR>some messes, waste some money, learn value, have a great time playing the 
<BR>game, make ever-larger sums of money and increase your freedom. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Even better news. An auction business is easy compared to other kinds of 
<BR>businesses. I have worked for other people for years, taken orders and toed 
<BR>the line. As an entrepreneur, I have made money at real estate, information 
<BR>selling, mail order, multi-level marketing -  all the standard stuff. I can tell you 
<BR>definitely, positively, that Internet auctions are easier than any of those. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>This doesn’t mean that money just falls into your hands because it doesn’t. But 
<BR>it does mean that you don’t take orders from others. <B>You </B>make the decisions. 
<BR>And... you don’t have to go looking for your customers because they’re already 
<BR>waiting for you. What could be better? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>What is it like to play the auction game? It is exciting, challenging, frustrating, 
<BR>fascinating, nerve-wracking, rewarding, and on and on. But it is never boring. 
<BR>I love this business and I hope that you will, too. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>It’s an e-commerce party, a celebration, <B>a happening... </B>and you’re invited tojoin the rest of us on the <B>road to online success!</B></FONT>
