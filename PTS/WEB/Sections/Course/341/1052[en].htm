<B><FONT size=4>Stand Out With Unique Items</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The primary reasons why people buy at Net auction are for uniqueness and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>convenience. Make that your Net auction mantra and lodge it firmly in your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mind. Selling at an auction automatically provides the convenience that many</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers are seeking. So let’s zero in on uniqueness, the idea of something</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>being one-of-a-kind... or, at least, something that you can’t buy in Wal Mart.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Basically, there are four strategies to find and sell unique items…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Create them yourself.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Publish your own high profit product.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Acquire exclusive rights.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Choose private-labeling.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Create Your Own Product</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What’s the most common lament heard from the lips of the average consumer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>today? “Same old. Same old.” The same chain restaurants, the same labels on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>our clothes, the same furniture design and the list goes on. Add a decline in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customer service and product quality into this pot of emotional flatness.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And what boils up?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Golden opportunities </B>rise to the surface for the entrepreneur or business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>owner to develop their own unique product.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The profit potential can be terrific because costs are so low for the craftsperson.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is no manufacturer to pay and the materials are usually very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>inexpensive. However, these items are costly in terms of <B>time </B>which is why</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they can often command very high prices. Anyone involved in this end of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business must truly be passionate about what they are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are literally hundreds, probably thousands, of wonderful items on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions every day. We could have an entire series of books just on products</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and ideas. However, to keep this chapter within reasonable bounds I have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>chosen examples that demonstrate certain principles to follow in choosing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items to create and to buy.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One of the most powerful profit-producing principles is to minimize</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>circumstances that are beyond your control. The best way to do this is through</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>exclusivity. </B>Whenever possible, <B>own </B>the product you are selling. We’re not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>just talking about the possession of an object. We’re talking about owning the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>rights to a design, an intellectual property, or an invention.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One powerful way to do that is to create your product yourself...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Use what Nature has provided for free </B>-- An enterprising jewelrymaker</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>picks up stones on the beach and makes jewelry out of them. While her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>actual jewelry supplies may have a minimal cost, obviously the stones do not.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is almost total profit and a great example of creativity and ingenuity using</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what nature provides.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Turn ideas into profit </B>-- Need some type of spark to get your neurons</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>firing? Make way for your own personal switchboard for idea generation…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Niche Idea #1</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One enterprising lady named Priscilla turned a nuisance into a profit center. In</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>her backyard there were many kumquat trees planted by a former owner.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These trees produced huge amounts of these tiny fruits and the current owner</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>couldn’t begin to use it all. In fact, the fruit fell to the ground, rotted and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>attracted all sorts of critters who also ate her other plants.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unlike some grocery store produce, her kumquat fruit is very sweet with never</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a trace of bitterness. Mostly out of curiosity, she bought some inexpensive</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>baskets and filled them with her fruit, and listed them on eBay. To her surprise,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this liability sold for very high prices. She guaranteed the sweetness and sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everything she had, making several thousand dollars in profits. This season,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>she plans to enlarge her product line by adding other items such as kumquat</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>muffins and jam.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It must be noted that already-prepared food that isn’t packaged in a factory is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>relatively rare. But exceptions can be found. Quality, freshness and great</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>packaging are essential in you decide to go this route.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The disadvantage to Priscilla’s kind of product is that it is so seasonal. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Priscilla decides she wants a year-round business, she is going to have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expand what she does. It wouldn’t be hard, however, to create a reputation as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the “Kumquat Lady.” Creating a niche in the market is the best way to build an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Internet business... or any other kind of small business for that matter.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Priscilla could branch out with recipes, jams, cakes, gardening advice, a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>column in a magazine, a cookbook and more. She could promote all these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items on a Web site.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>An avid gardener in Atlanta grows attractive and popular flowers called</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>impatiens. But hers are unusual because they re-seed themselves. Nurseries</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prefer to create plants that do not re-seed themselves so that they must be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>purchased again each year. (From the nurseries, of course.) In fact, it is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>virtually impossible to find these plants in the usual garden stores.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This lovely lady had an ad in a small gardening magazine and decided to try</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>out an Internet auction. They were an immediate hit and she could have sold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many, many more. It was the beginning of an auction obsession with her.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Since then this entrepreneur has sold countless numbers of plants.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is a perfect example of the power of the Internet auction. She has made</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tons of new friends, from as far away as Japan, and acquired many new plants.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>She now spends almost as much time on her computer as in her garden!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When plotting and scheming for your business, pay attention to the ideas that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>surround you. Borrow from other businesses. For example, Book of the Month</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Club, Literary Guild, all the CD and tape clubs, have made zillions of dollars</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>providing such services. Why not offer one yourself?</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>Four teachers in Indiana all quit their jobs within a few months of each other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because they wanted to stay home with their young children. They formed a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>social group and remained friends for about three years before they decided</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they wanted to make some extra money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It took them a few months of trying and discarding ideas before they decided</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they wanted to focus on the idea of creating outdoor rooms. Warm months in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Indiana are very precious so they decided to capitalize locally on the mania for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>outdoor living. Their first products were garden stakes made of metal. Some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have glass inserts as sun catchers and other have holders that provide space</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for a candle. <B>The stakes all add to…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… the beauty of the surrounding nature. </B>They were so</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>successful that they slowly added other products, such as outdoor furniture,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>umbrellas and plant holders.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, they live in a tiny town and felt the market was becoming saturated.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Much of their merchandise was too heavy to haul to flea markets so they had to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>settle for photographs. Folks in their area were suspicious of buying from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pictures and the method didn’t work all that well. In addition, the flea markets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are most popular on weekends and this was against the ethics of the group.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>After all, the reason they quit a regular job was to be with their families! If they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>were gone all weekend, they were defeating their purpose.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So for these ladies, the auctions are a godsend. One of the greatest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advantages of an auction is that you don’t have to be there to sell! And for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>folks who value weekends and family time, auctions are awesome!</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>He spotted a picture of the famous old flag, “Don’t Tread on Me” in a history</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>book and had it copied. The print was from 1800’s so therefore it had no</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you choose a seasonal product, think about what you can sell in your “off”</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>George’s wife Sharon really understands marketing. When they ship a cart, it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>always contains an unadvertised bonus that the customer didn’t expect. The</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>or unusual kitchen tool, gift certificates for coffee or baked goods, beautiful</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>paper napkins or packages of bread mixes. Since they don’t mention these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items in their ads, the customer is always delighted.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Keep an eye out for specials. They make great bonuses that you can include</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>personalization. They can create more product in a shorter time that way. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, they buy the headboards as a very stripped-down, basic model and</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>makes more money selling kites than he makes at his job. His wife Gwen is a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>graphic designer. She has created a gorgeous brochure that he includes with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>every kite. It is filled with details the history of kites as well as teaching how to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fly one.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is a great example of a <B>targeted niche. </B>Based on your experience or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hobby, what type of product could you create that would capture the attention</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of other like-minded folks?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Niche Idea #15</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As a child, Lewis had a heart condition that prevented him from most physical</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>activity so he became interested in music -- specifically, the dulcimer, a very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>uncommon musical instrument these days. It seemed inevitable that he would</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someday begin to make his own. Soon he had so many that he could never,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ever, play them all. He tried giving them away but there were very few people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in his small town who were interested.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He finally set up a booth at an annual Labor Day craft fair near Atlanta, and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>began to find people who might be interested in his passion. But sales were</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>still slow. When the Internet came into his life, he found interested people</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>online and began selling to some of them. And then when the auctions came</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>along, he was jubilant and became an early seller. He now has a thriving</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business as a full-time instrument maker and often plays for audiences to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>further promote his business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The Internet is a perfect venue for someone like Lewis who was unable to find</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>people with the same passion in his own small pond. The Net auctions open</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>up the world and Lewis has sold many of his instruments in eastern European</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>countries.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What’s the take-home message? Uniqueness is the result of thinking “outsidethe-</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>box.” Examine what you do and use daily. Is there a potential product or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service that you could create and auction?</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Publish Your Own InfoProduct</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>High profits... the goal of every business owner. Possibly the most lucrative</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products to sell today are <B>information products. </B>There is an insatiable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>demand for information, especially in smaller, niche categories.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Everyone has information that is of value to others. It’s a matter of putting it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>together into a marketable product.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>At a recent entrepreneurial meeting I mentioned this idea and was met with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>overwhelming opposition. All of the objections centered around two</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>perceptions: that there is very little profit in information products and that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain skills are needed to create these products.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Wrong on both accounts.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>No matter what is your business model (i.e., high price/low sales volume or low</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>price/ high sales volume) people are willing to pay for the convenience of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>knowledge at their fingertips.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are lots of ways to create an information product…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Write your own manuscript. </B>All that is required is brain power and time.</FONT>

<BR></FONT><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Turn your speech into a book. </B>Author and speaker Mark Nolan relates</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how he was paid $1500 to make a speech. The speech was taped so Mark</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>had it transcribed by a secretarial service, tweaked it a little bit and published it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>as a book.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Use a “teaser” to attract customers. </B>Intellectual property can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>effectively be used as a “teaser” to get interested parties to your Web site. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example, you might have a garden site and during the middle of the summer,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you offer a special report on plants that thrive in blazing hot sun. You offer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enough information for your prospect to use but you let them know that there is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more... much more. Where? On your Web site, naturally.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Find a local class. </B>If you are scratching your head and thinking that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t know anything worth writing about, then find someone who is teaching an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interesting subject in your local area. Speak with them about making an audio</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or videotape of their class and turn it into an information product.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You don’t need to limit your product to printed or electronic material. You can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>successfully sell cassettes or video-tapes or do video/audio online</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>productions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Use a ghost writer. </B>If you are not sure of your writing abilities and/or don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have much spare time, <B>hire a…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>… ghost writer. </B>You provide the content. Your ghost writer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provides the style. Often it is possible to hire a non-professional or a student</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for a very modest price.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Review government publications. </B>Take advantage of some of that tax</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money you pay to the Feds. The U.S. and Canadian governments have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reports written on all kinds of amazing subjects. And none of them are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>copyrighted!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, you wouldn’t want to try to sell them “as is” because they are dull,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>duller and dullest. But you can take the information and flesh it out, add your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>own personality, and create an interesting piece.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Go to <B>Consumer Information Center </B><B>( http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/ ) </B>for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ideas.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Find a partner. </B>Another possibility is to work with someone else and split</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the profits. They do the writing and you provide the knowledge, experience</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and research for the information product.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Interview an expert. </B>A very simple method is to get a telephone recorder</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and interview an expert. From your notes, develop a print or electronic</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>product, or both. If you decide to use the tape recordings, create a simple</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>guide to go with them.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Encourage people to tell their story. </B>The “Chicken Soup” books are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>composed of a collection of stories written by different people. Each</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>inspirational book is geared to a certain target group. The success of this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>brand illustrates the profit potential of human interest stories.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Make money from research. </B>Another great possibility is to compile a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>directory. Perhaps you want to research Web sites that deal only with crafts.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You could divide your product into various categories (knitting, crochet, cross</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stitch and needlepoint) and find relevant sites and annotate each one.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Or you might compile an anthology or a collection of interviews of other people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this case, you would create a guide or questionnaire, give it to each person</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you are interviewing to complete and then you simply edit the collected</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Cookbooks are a great example of this kind of product. Think of the infinite</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>possibilities of cookbooks... special occasion books, books for specific targets,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>books with cultural cooking, books for specific foods, books for special diets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>like low-fat or high fiber. In other words, the combinations are almost infinite.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And as an added bonus, cookbooks can be produced cheaply.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When the copyright on a book expires (or perhaps it never had one in the first</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>place), the book becomes “public domain” which means that it is available to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anyone who wants it, with no restrictions or strings attached. These two sites</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are great resources for public domain books… <B>http://www.promo.net/pg /</B></FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>OK. Your mind is racing -- so many possible directions to go in. Before you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spring into action, use these tips to ensure success…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Copyright your intellectual property. </B>Here are some copyright</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>protection techniques…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>Write the idea down, get it notarized and mail to yourself via registered mail.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Have the envelope seams date-stamped by the Post Office. Don’t open the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>envelope but keep it sealed and put in a safe deposit box along with the postal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receipt.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>You can have an attorney write letter saying they have a copy of your idea</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on file in their office as of such and such a date and are keeping it in a sealed</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>file for you.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Vary your format. </B>You will skip over huge profits if you assume that your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers only want information in one format! Multiple formats accommodate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>different <B>learning styles. </B>People have a dominant way of processing what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they hear and see. For example, I am a visual learner and I much prefer to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>read. The audio books that are so popular now hold little appeal for me.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you have a written product, you could broaden its appeal by adding…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Electronic versions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Videos</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Audio</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Teleconferences</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>CDs and diskettes</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Seminars</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Games</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Calendars and daily inspirations</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One-on-one consulting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Small elite-membership groups</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Radio and TV presentations</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Retreats</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Monthly newsletters</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Hard goods like mugs and T-shirts</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can create different formats, too. Why not on-going study courses with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>weekly lessons or more in-depth, advanced material? Or what about licensing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products? Stand out from the crowd and be seen and/or heard.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Acquire Exclusive Rights</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Believe it or not, it isn’t difficult to get <B>exclusive rights </B>to a product. You don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>even need up-front money. Probably the easiest way to do this is to get an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>exclusive on a <B>method of distribution.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What does that mean? Good question. Let’s say that you invent the Fancy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Gizmo Super Spud Peeler, patent it and find a company to sell it in grocery</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stores. A year later, along comes Eli Entrepreneur who wants to promote this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>great peeler through mail order. Eli agrees to a five-year agreement with you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for the Internet only. He pays you no money up front but the agreement is void</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>if he doesn’t sell a minimum of 50,000 Super Spuds a year.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Who wouldn’t agree? There’s no risk involved. Either you sell an extra quarter</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of a million products with no effort on your part or the agreement is void. It</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>costs you nothing and on the plus side, you get a new and valuable method of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>distribution.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now let’s turn the tables around. This time you are the entrepreneur looking</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for products to market. Where can you find these products?…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Inventors Clubs </B>-- There are many brilliant people who take a little bit of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this, <B>add a little of that…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>…and create wonderful products. </B>But the catch is that they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know nothing about how to sell and market them. Here is where you ride to the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>rescue.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This industry is filled with rip-off artists who charge struggling inventors large</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>amounts of money to promote their products. And in the end, deliver nothing.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You would be a refreshing change from all of those sleazy people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are hundreds of inventors’ associations all over the United States and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Canada. Many wonderful products are available for you to market. For more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>details, visit these helpful Web sites <B>http://marketlaunchers.com/ </B>and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>http://www.uiausa.com/ </B>The <B>U.S. Patent Office </B>has a wealth of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information as well <B>( http://www.uspto.gov/).</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are extremely wealthy people like E. Joseph Cossman who have made</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>millions of dollars by promoting someone else’s ideas. Cossman’s book, “How</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I Made $1,000,000 in Mail Order (And You Can Too),” is a bit dated. The last</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>revision was in 1984. In spite of that, it makes for fascinating reading.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, Internet auctions didn’t exist when he was creating his fortune. But</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>his marketing principles endure. Even though we use electrons and he used</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>paper, he can still teach us a great deal about successful auction selling. Here</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are three of his key principles that are totally appropriate for our Net auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>Find products that are selling well but are reaching only a limited market. He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would ask the owners of the products to let him sell the items in a different way.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Isn’t that perfect for the auction business?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In fact, the auction business has exploded because individuals and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>businesses are marketing products in this new format. For example, millions of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cars are now sold at auctions -- a method which didn’t even exist only two or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>three years ago.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Never fall in love with your products. Great advice. I am often surprised by</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what sells and what doesn’t. If you follow the auctions for a while, you will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receive many surprises as well.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The best advice anyone can receive about this principle is test, test, test! Don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make a major investment in any merchandise, no matter what anyone else</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>says, until you have sold a certain amount of it. I have known auction sellers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who were positive that something would sell, and bought huge amounts of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchandise -- only to be stuck with it. Don’t let this happen to you.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Look at your products with “new eyes.” To illustrate this, Cossman</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>described a situation where he was stuck with 5,000 necklaces. Each one had</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seven stones in them. Around that time, a famous case involving hypnotism</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and reincarnation was one of the hottest news stories of the day. A hypnotist</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>explained that a “point of fixation” was needed to hypnotize someone.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Cossman realized that his 35,000 stones were perfect points of fixation. So he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sold them individually, along with a book on hypnotism. They were a smash hit</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and he sold over 100,000 of them. By looking at his loser necklaces with new</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eyes, he made a lot of money.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Library </B>-- Back issues of popular magazines can reveal a treasury of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lucrative products for you to market. A five-year-old gizmo may be ready for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>another turn in the spotlight.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Our mentor from above, Joe Cossman, really does have the golden touch. He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>recycled a fad from years past. It was known as a “fly cake”-- an alluring</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concoction that flies can’t resist. He sold more fly cakes on the second-goround</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>than were sold during its market debut.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Ads in all kinds of publications </B>-- Ads in newspapers, newsletters and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>magazines sometimes have some great products. For example, a recent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>newsletter wanted Americans and Canadians to sell native clothing from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Liberia and Sierra Leone.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>4) Standard Rate and Data</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.srds.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The <B>SRDS </B>is a superb resource for the home business. It is very expensive to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>own so go to your library and find it. Believe me, it’s worth the hunt. Trade</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>journals can be an incredible source for ideas and products and the <B>SRDS</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>has an extensive list of these. It also has sections on consumer magazines,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>international magazines, business publications, mailing lists and newspapers.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Patent Attorneys </B>-- This is a tough way to find products because patent</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>attorneys are very reluctant to work with strangers. But if you can persuade</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them to cooperate, they often are a great resource.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Offline sources </B>-- You can even advertise for products. Let people know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that you are actively searching for products. Here is an ad that a private</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>individual inserted into the Sunday business section of his local paper...</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff size=3>Millionaire consultant seeks inventors, manufacturers, 
<BR>importers, authors, etc., with unique products suitable for 
<BR>promotion to homeowners, do-it-yourselfers, gardeners and 
<BR>hobbyists. Send your information in confidence to (contact 
<BR>info).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>He received 280 replies!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Do Private Labeling</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You most likely have some <B>privately labeled products </B>in your home.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are many companies in Canada and the United States who sell “stock”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or “standard” formulas of products to many different companies. The only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>differences between these and dozens of other companies are the product</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>names and labels.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Marketing expert, Dan Kennedy, describes a distribution scenario for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fabulous weed killer. The manufacturer sold thousands of cans of this product</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to a chemical company that distributed only to restaurants and hotels. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>same manufacturer sold many more thousands of the same product to a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>national hardware chain under a different name. And finally, Dan’s company</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sold this same product with its own label.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Same product. Three companies. Three different labels.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can have all kinds of products manufactured and sold under your name in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>surprisingly small quantities.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Every industry has these private label manufacturers and they advertise very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>extensively in trade journals for their industry, and they attend many of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>trade shows. Some of these manufacturers even supply product liability</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>insurance that will cover your tiny home business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, one pet food owner has created a glucosamine supplement for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dogs. (In case you’re wondering, as I was, it’s good for joints.) It has been so</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>successful that she is planning to expand with seven new privately labeled</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products. The grocery and health industries have been doing this for years</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with their generic products.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>No matter which strategy you choose, you need an action plan to make your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time most productive and to achieve the results you want. For example, here’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an on-target plan of action…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Day 1 </B>-- go to the library and look at the “Standard Rate and Data.” Make a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>list of every magazine and trade journal that relates to your category.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Day 2 </B>-- write a simple letter/e-mail contacting each source and asking for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>copy of its publication.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Day 3 </B>-- while waiting for magazines and journals, create a data chart that you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can use to list each interesting product, its source, actions you can take, results</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and whatever other information that is relevant to your subject.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Day 4 </B>-- create a folder for different kinds of ideas. For example, a folder for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interesting products, one for experts you might interview for information product</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ideas, one for books or other information you might want to send away for to do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>research, one for names of companies that do private labeling, etc.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Day 5 </B>(and on) -- as your publications arrive, go through and highlight each</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interesting product, person or merchandise possibility.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Day 6 </B>(and on) -- write letters, call or e-mail about all the ideas, companies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and people you have identified as worthwhile in the publications reviewed on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Day 5.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Repeat Days 5 and 6 tasks until you find lucrative ideas that you can use to sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the auction sites. By doing this, you will develop successful items that aren’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>being sold by 50 other people. <B>Uniqueness </B>is the goal.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Time to move on to a profitable type of auction business where you sell 
<BR>merchandise that you have never even seen and where you don’t have to 
<BR>invest a penny of your own money. 
<BR>&nbsp;I thought that might tweak some curiosity …</FONT>
