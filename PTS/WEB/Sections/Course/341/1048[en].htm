<B><FONT size=4>Arguments, Disputes and Fraud</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Truthfully, my experience in auctions has been remarkably pleasant, efficient</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and error-free. My respect for my fellow auctioneers is very high.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Nevertheless, there are a few horror stories floating around the ethers, and it is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>always smart to be prepared for the worst. The more business you do, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more likely you are to run into some dishonest people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And besides, if you happen to run into the Jack the Ripper of Cyberspace, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to know how to handle him -- as best anyone can...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Disputes</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are the inevitable disputes that happen. Your deal goes sour but there</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>isn’t any fraud. Just two (or more) people who are both convinced that they are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>right. It’s the other guy who is wrong, wrong, wrong!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Picture the possibilities in your mind...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Your buyer doesn’t respond </B>-- What if your auction is over but the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer doesn’t respond? First of all, don’t panic! There might be valid reasons</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>why they have ignored you. Don’t rush out and give negative feedback about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this buyer right away. Give the guy a little breathing space before jumping to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>conclusions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Send your buyer a <B>gentle reminder, something like…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… “Just what is the matter with you, Dork??” (Kidding, of</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>course.)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Mention your last message and remind them that the auction site considers a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bid a valid contract. Remind him that you have held up your part of the bargain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and you expect him to do the same. <B>Specify </B>a date by which you expect</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>payment.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If after a couple of weeks, you still haven’t heard from the buyer, the only</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>recourse you have is to leave bad feedback on the buyer. Refuse to ever allow</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>him to bid on your merchandise again.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unfortunately, you will have to relist your item and start again. That is just part</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of the risk of the game. Or you can check the bids on your item and contact the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>second-highest bidder and ask if he is still interested in your merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you post your feedback, be <B>professional </B>about it. Calling someone</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>horrible names and being really ugly does not serve your seller image at all. In</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>short, Mr. Bogus Buyer isn’t worth it!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) A bad check </B>-- Earlier, we discussed the importance of deciding on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>method of payment in advance of your first auction. As you recall, you either</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hold the check, or only accept money orders, or use a third party like PayPal.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Veteran sellers say that most often a bouncing check is just a mistake that the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>embarrassed buyer will correct when it is pointed out. If you are uncomfortable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with the risk, don’t assume it. And, of course, I would never ship a really</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>expensive item until I was certain I had my money.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Damage </B>-- What if you send an item and when the buyer receives it, it’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>damaged? I urge you to take responsibility for this problem, rather than ignore</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unless you are selling a zillion dollar item, your reputation as a professional</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and honest seller is much more important than a single item. It is best to either</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>replace the item, if you have one, or refund the buyer’s money. You can then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>take your claim to your carrier. With the Post Office, if it is under $50, they will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>give you a money order at your local office.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What I do know, however, is to stay tuned for some hassle. As mentioned</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>earlier, all of the carriers will insist that if it wasn’t properly packed, that they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t owe you. (Of course, they don’t mind accepting “improperly packed”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items but that’s a different story apparently.)</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Merchandise not as advertised </B>-- If you are the seller, and you made a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mistake, <B>rectify </B>the situation. Perhaps you misunderstood something about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your merchandise. Perhaps you thought it was an original, and it wasn’t.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps the buyer still wants the item but at a lower price -- so refund some of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their money. Or take back the item and refund all of the money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The kind of seller who deliberately misleads customers won’t last in the auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Buyer’s remorse </B>-- What if your buyer changes her mind? For some odd</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reason, there are people who just like to bid, and who never plan on buying</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anything. Their participation is short-lived as their reputation gets around.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>These buyers receive all kinds of negative feedback and comments in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>discussion rooms and on message boards.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On eBay, after two non-payment claims, the buyer receives a warning. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>next time, it’s a 30-day suspension. After that, they are permanently</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>suspended.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Irreconcilable Disagreements</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes, it just isn’t possible to amicably settle a dispute. In that case, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have several possible remedies. Just be aware that if the deal isn’t really a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>major one, all veterans will strongly urge you to forget it. This may not be fair...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it may not be right... but it is definitely <B>smart.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here are your options...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Formal Complaint </B>-- Provide the facts in a <B>calm </B>manner. If it becomes a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>matter for law-enforcement agencies, the site may not notify you of the results.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The buyer or seller can become a <B>NARU </B>(Not a Registered User).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Unfortunately, unscrupulous people may simply re-register under a new name.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If it isn‘t a law-enforcement problem, you will be notified that customer service</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will contact you. This is a pretty overworked crowd and you may not hear from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them for days.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The auction sites can’t compel someone to honor their agreement with you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Their only course of action is to suspend the guilty part from the auction site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and hopefully from the auction business. Ultimately, auction sites are a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>community, </B>and like any small town, word gets around. Your outstanding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and fair dealings will become known, as will the actions of undesirable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>deviants.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Insurance </B>-- In any event, if you have used wisdom in your dealings, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will have used an <B>escrow service </B>for any expensive items and thus</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eliminated your risk.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of the sites themselves offer insurance but this is usually for buyers, not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sellers. If you are careless enough to ship merchandise for which you have not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>been paid, you are on your own.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>eBay has contracted an specialized service called <B>Square Trade</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>( http://www.squaretrade.com/ ) </B>to help resolve disputes between buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and sellers. It is a <B>free Web-based forum </B>which allows users to attempt to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>resolve their differences on their own. You can file a complaint and Square</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Trade will then contact the other party.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, if you are dealing with a genuine crook, this system is of no use</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because they won’t abide by the results. On the other hand, this method is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>effective between two honest people who have simply become outraged with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>each other.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Outright Fraud</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sellers are definitely in a stronger position than buyers. We are the ones in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>charge of the merchandise and we don’t need to ship until we are sure we</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have been paid. As well, credit cards and the intermediary services like</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>PayPal make it so much safer than in the past.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you happen to find yourself involved in a fraud dispute, in addition to notifying</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the auction site, you may also want to use the services of the following</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agencies...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>National Fraud Information Center</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.fraud.org/welcome.htm</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Internet Fraud Complain Center</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>https://www.ifccfbi.gov/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Federal Trade Commission</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.ftc.gov/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Better Business Bureau</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.bbb.org/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you have a problem with a seller or vendor, a complaint to the BBB may have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some effect. They are the best-known “policing” organization. There are lots of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consumers who check with them before doing business with a company.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If there is a bad report from the BBB, many customers will back away and most</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>companies know this. Therefore, no legitimate outfit wants bad information in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their files and many will go to great lengths to prevent a bad reputation --</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>including dealing fairly with you.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Postmaster General (if you used the Post Office)</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>800-275-8777</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>All of the above agencies handle fraud complaints in the same general way.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Since we are dealing with Internet fraud, correspondence is handled on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Net. If you are ever involved in this unpleasantness, you will first be asked to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fill out a form. Then you will be assigned a case number. The agency will ask</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you for specifics and generally no action will be taken until 30 days has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>elapsed. After your form is filed, they will notify the opposing party.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If there is fraud involved, the law enforcement agencies may or may not take</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>legal steps. They are secretive about their criteria for legal action. If you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the one and only person to complain, I realistically doubt that much will be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>done. However, the power of reporting someone to a law enforcement agency</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can be tremendous. Just filing a complaint may accomplish everything you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>desire.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One important tip is to save every bit of <B>correspondence </B>you have from and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about this person. I have a separate account just for my auction selling and I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>save e-mail for weeks, sometimes months.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Bottom line?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>The best protection is the one you create yourself.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Consider this “fraud” tactic. Sometimes a buyer is contacted by someone who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>falsely represents themselves as the seller.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Like a masked bandit...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>... he (or she) directs the buyer </B>to make payment to a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain address.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Obviously, if you have sold your prized collectible to Sandra, you don’t want</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>her sending her money to the wrong seller. So respond promptly to your buyer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>before someone else can solicit their money. If a buyer gets two messages</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>requesting payment, she is going to contact the auction site to see who is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>legitimate.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are really only three ways that you can be defrauded by a dishonest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Non payment </B>-- You can protect yourself from this scam if you <B>carefully</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>choose your payment options. If you do accept checks, allow plenty of time for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the bank to clear them. Be sure to make it crystal clear to your buyers that this</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is your policy. Once the bank has informed you that the check is good, you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>protected.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) The buyer claims they never received their items </B>-- This possibility</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is why I am so ferocious about some sort of tracking system with any packages</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I send. On the rare occasion that the buyer wants a really cheap mailing option</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that doesn’t qualify for tracking, I send him an e-mail stating that this is his risk,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not mine. And I save the e-mail. My e-mail system also allows for a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>confirmation that the recipient has received my e-mail. I do this for all auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>correspondence.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) The buyer claims the merchandise was damaged </B>-- This issue is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the toughest to handle. Perhaps it really was damaged, in which case we have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an obligation to satisfy the buyer and then deal with the carrier.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Preventing fraud in this area depends on your guarantee. Do you have one?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What are its terms?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>With a more expensive item, you can take a <B>photo </B>of it, along with the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>shipping label before you send it. For less expensive items, you will have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decide if it is worth the trouble to you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One seller told me he has an occasional fraudulent return where the buyer will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>insist that it was damaged when he knows it wasn’t. But he is making so much</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money that the seller states it isn’t worth his time to argue. He simply</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>substitutes or returns the buyer’s money.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your best protection is <B>good records </B>so that you can prove that you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>telling the truth. There are many more buyers defrauded than sellers so the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sympathy leans toward the buyer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Key point? <B>Protect yourself.</B></FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Unethical Activities</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I see myself as a professional auction seller, and I suggest that you view</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yourself that way, too. It is in our best interests to keep our auction community</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clean and safe for all. Therefore, it is our responsibility and privilege to report</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>any unscrupulous activities that we see, even if we aren’t directly involved. For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Suspect Feedback... </B>Feedback is designed as a protection for honest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyers and sellers, a way to forestall problems and keep all the players honest.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do not allow unscrupulous people to take advantage of the system.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The big sites like eBay, Amazon and Yahoo have thousands and thousands of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items, and no matter how hard the site crew works, there are bound to be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cheaters. There always are. So if you see the following kinds of abuses, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>must make a personal decision about whether to report them...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) Shill feedback </B>is used if someone’s feedback rating is lousy. They may try</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to get around it. Either Mr. Unscrupulous can have friends register on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction site and give rave reviews or he will create several accounts and use</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one account to give positive feedback to another account. The system surely</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>isn’t foolproof or “crook-proof.”</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) Feedback extortion </B>is defined as trying to force someone into a certain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>action by threatening negative feedback. It’s hard to believe that someone</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would be so stupid as to do this. All the intended victim would have to do is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mail the extortion threat to the site authorities. But many veteran sellers assure</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>me that this happens.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) Feedback solicitation </B>occurs when someone wants to bargain -- no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>threats, just a solicitation for feedback. “I’ll buy your widget if you’ll give me</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>some great feedback,” or “I’ll give you positive feedback if...”</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Bidding Abuses... </B>We discussed sniping earlier. Although many</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctioneers complain about it, it isn’t illegal. There are, however, bidding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>practices that are considered illegal and can lead to expulsion from the site...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) Shill bidding </B>is probably quite common, although it may not be obvious</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from the outside. It is a way of protecting your price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Suppose you want to sell an item for at least $500. As we have previously</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mentioned, many buyers won’t bid on an item with a reserve price. So that’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not an option. You could start your minimum bid at $500. This will turn off</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many buyers and you know that hot sellers begin at a lower price. So what if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your $500 items sells for $50? One way to protect yourself is by shielding the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bid. This means that you get friends and relatives to bid on the item, either to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>run the price up or to prevent a sale at too low a price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The auction sites know the outcome of a sale but they have no way of knowing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whether the merchandise ever actually changed hands. If neither seller or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyer ever complain, they assume all is well.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) Bid siphoning </B>is a practice that can truly bring a quick end to your auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>career. Suppose Joe is selling an item and the current price is $50. You email</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the bidders with the information that you have the same item and will sell it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for $40, thus undercutting the seller.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) Auction interference </B>occurs when someone e-mails the bidders in an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>open auction and warns them away from the seller or a particular item. This</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>occurred to me once when someone sent me an e-mail warning me that a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>certain person who had bid on my item was not to be trusted. What could I do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with this kind of information? Not much.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As a seller, you have the right to refuse to do business with a particular person.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But I certainly wasn’t going to invoke that right based on an anonymous e-mail.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And the way I have set up my selling system, it is impossible to cheat me out of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>my goods. This person didn’t win the auction anyway so it was a moot point.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Was this comment from an anonymous sender meant to be helpful or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>destructive? Who knows?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iv) Bid manipulation #1 </B>refers to a suspect duo. Suppose that Susie is an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wild-eyed collector of Dukes of Hazzard lunchboxes and her arch-rival, Jodie,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is the high bidder on a particularly tasty box. If Susie is unscrupulous, she</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>might bid higher and higher until she discovers Jodie’s highest price. And then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>she retracts her bid.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3><B>Bid manipulation #2 </B>is the other half of the duo. On eBay, if an item</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receives 30 bids, it becomes a hot item and receives a favored position at the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>very beginning of the category. Some sellers will request that friends bid on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their item just to propel it into this category.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>v) Chronic bid manipulation </B>involves folks who chronically bid and then</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>withdraw.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Unlawful Identity... </B>Some people have represented themselves as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>employees of the auction site. There are also dishonest individuals who have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>used the identity of other users to post rotten feedback or insult others with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>impunity. There are some who for some bizarre reason delight in making bids</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in the name of other people.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Finally, there are those who use false information when registering. If you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a seller, you may soon be found out if any charges accrue to you and the site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>tries to process your credit information. And if you are a buyer, you will have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>supply correct information to the seller, or you won’t get your merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Miscellaneous Offenses... </B>Naturally, there are offenses that are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prohibited because they jeopardize the site and the safe auctioning of items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Surprise, surprise! Interfering with the site (i.e., hacking) is prohibited. So is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Spam </B>but you are going to get some.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Once you have dealt with a buyer or seller, you then have their address.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Revealing any information other than e-mail addresses online is definitely an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>outlaw act. I know of some instances where people have gotten mad and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>published full contact information. Definitely a no-no.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This may sound like a broken record but it’s worth repeating. Once you begin</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to make significant amounts of money on the auction sites, you will realize that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>being suspended, temporarily or permanently, is a <B>serious </B>problem.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is akin to getting fired -- only the auction game is a whole lot more lucrative 
<BR>and fun than most jobs. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>To maximize your profits, you have to become an <B>expert. </B>The next chapterwill show you how to naturally become one...</FONT>
