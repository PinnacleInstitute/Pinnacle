<B><FONT size=4>Promote Your Business</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One thing is for sure. If you want to turbo-boost your business profits, seriously</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consider the following plan of action… <B>increase targeted customer traffic</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>to magnify income.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We all know that to make money on the Internet, you have to sell something.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is no other way. You may be selling a service or a product (this could</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be an actual physical object, or a digital one that can be downloaded from the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Net) or a combination of both.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And no matter what your business sells, you need customers to be successful.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As I said earlier, you have to attract <B>targeted </B>buyers to your product/service - </FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>buyers who are interested in what you are selling and <B>value </B>its benefits.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>An Internet auction is an exceptional way to promote your business. Auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your product/service at high profile sites like eBay and Yahoo to attract the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>attention </B>of hundreds or thousands of people. Then once you have their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“eyes” and interest at your auction listing(s), you can persuade these target</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers to click through to your Web site for more information and to buy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>other items.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are literally thousands of businesses that are promoted each day on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction sites. The ones that are included in this chapter illustrate key profitstimulating</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strategies. As you read, remember that the products and services</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>being sold aren’t nearly as important as the way in which sellers are using the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction sites.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, it is obvious from the picture below that this retail establishment is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling right out of the store. What does this illustrate?...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Table.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Table.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Simple. An ad on eBay is definitely <B>cheaper </B>than a tiny one with no picture in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the local newspaper. It also beats the high-cost cost of a Yellow Pages ad and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>its space restrictions!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, there may be some limitations on this idea. For example, if you are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a barber trying to auction haircuts on the Net, your target market is somewhat</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>restricted <B>unless your motto is…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... “Have scissors will travel.”</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But what if you have <B>additional income streams </B>beyond hair cutting?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps you private label some hair-care products for men. Or you sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>magazines for men, or have a mail order business of fashion accessories, or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>refer customers to hair transplant establishments, or sell a line of hair coloring</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products, or ... well, you get the idea. Auctions would be an ideal way to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>promote all of these. List one product and have buyers/visitors click through to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your main sales site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>By opening up other options, eBay no longer has the same grip over your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business as the sole money-making source. <B>This independence allows</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>you to use eBay, rather than the reverse </B>- where eBay uses you. Take</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advantage of their well-oiled gigantic network to drive traffic to your auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>listings and to supplement your own traffic efforts to your Web site.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some people make the mistake of seeing customer traffic flow moving only in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>direction way - from Web site to auction site. Nothing could be further from the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>truth. <B>Traffic goes in both directions. </B>Find some products that have high</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>demand on the auction sites and then create a Web site “theme” based on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>OK. Time to examine some more bound-for-success auction strategies to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>promote your business...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Your Own Product</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Auctions are a great way to easily <B>get the word out </B>about your product.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s look at how one seller does it effectively. He uses a Dutch auction to sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a neck cream that is supposed to reduce wrinkles. The cost of the cream is $3.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What’s his plan?...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Promote the Product’s Value </B>- The seller carefully promotes the value</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of his product. He claims that the “normal” cost is $240 per session. What a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bargain and it’s only for eBay customers...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Milan.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Milan.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A premium product for a premium group at a premium discount!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Promote your Web Site </B>- This smart seller has an accompanying Web</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>site which he promotes in his listing. As you will see, within two paragraphs he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gives the address three times. He reduces the chance to nil that surfing eyes</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will breeze over that important reference...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Contact.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Contact.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Promote other auctions </B>- Never miss a chance to promote your other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Before.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Before.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Promote through pictures </B>- “A picture is worth a thousand words.” The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller uses a professional picture to <B>reinforce </B>the quality of his product and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by extension, his whole business...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Beauty.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Beauty.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, the emaciated Vogue model look may not appeal to everyone but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>we can be sure that she doesn’t have a wrinkled neck. Or so the picture</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>suggests.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Use these four easy-to-do promotional techniques as a springboard to get you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>started. Keep track of new ideas that you discover on your Net travels. <B>All</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>visitors to your auction listing(s) are potential customers.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Funnel that auction traffic to your main business site and then monetize that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>traffic through different income sources - affiliate programs (see below in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>17.3.), e-books sales, services, etc. For more information about “monetization</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>models,” visit <B>http://auctions.sitesell.com/</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For a business owner, income from the auctions is the biggest and most</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete benefit. But you also win in the area of <B>customer acquisition. </B>For</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>without customers, there are no sales.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Market Penetration</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When asked how to begin a business, marketing guru Dan Kennedy once</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advised... “Give it away!”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you auction your goods or services for low prices, you can begin to create a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>huge clientele base immediately. You are able to penetrate the market quickly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with this business model.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Ken used this strategy for <B>Make Your Site Sell! </B>(his first product). He set its</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>price at least one tenth of what its major competitors were charging even</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>though it overdelivered in every way <B>( http://myss.sitesell.com/ ) .</B></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Why would you choose this model? For the same reason that Ken did...</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Because you recognize that each customer has a lifetime value. That value</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>can be hundreds of times greater than some small profit you might make on the</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>first sale of your product. It’s so much cheaper to keep a customer than it is to</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>recruit a new one.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Take a closer look at the listing below. A satellite dish ... for a <B>penny?</B>...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Satalite.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Satalite.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How in the world can this be profitable? The first thing we need to understand</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is that he is the <B>representative </B>(salesman or affiliate) for a satellite TV</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>company. He is not paying for these dishes himself. Instead, he makes money</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by promoting the company’s free dish offer. That is his “business.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can go to any Search Engine, type in “free satellite TV” and find this offer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everywhere. For example, I did just that at AltaVista and the first ad I clicked</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>brought up this offer ...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=FreeDish.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/FreeDish.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Our seller is getting a <B>commission </B>or <B>referral fee </B>on each sale. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>company makes its money by collecting the monthly fee for the satellite</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>channels. It gives away as many of the satellites as it can, knowing the real</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profit comes from a fee structure. This smart person has two key concepts firmly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>rooted in his mind...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Customer acquisition </B>- He is using an incredibly high-traffic Web site</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(eBay) to promote his business. Before the auction was completed, he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>received bids from 362 people. We have no way of knowing what he will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>receive from the satellite company. But let’s say that his fees were $400. He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>made $10 per customer which equals $3,620. What a great <B>ROI (Return on</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Investment).</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Lifetime customer value </B>- Most likely, the greatest profit from this deal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will come later. He acquired a large number of new customers who may buy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>all kinds of other products in the future. He probably will receive <B>residual</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>income </B>from these people, as well. I contacted a couple of these companies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and each time a customer re-signs with the satellite company, the salesperson</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will receive a percentage.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Another great way to acquire and keep customers is by publishing your own ezine.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>Hundreds, then thousands, of your own visitors will sign up for your zine.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>This is important because...</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>1) </B>Most visitors subscribe before buying anything. You need to build a trusting</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>relationship first.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>2) </B>An e-zine makes it easy to generate recurring revenue. You can contact</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>your subscribers about relevant updates, upcoming auction items, new</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>products you are representing, etc. Your business stays on the radar screen.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>3) </B>A growing customer/prospect address list is the very foundation for building</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>a business with equity (i.e., a business you can sell). Sure, you’ll get some</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>sign-ups from the eBay traffic and you’ll add a few more from your buying eBay</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>customers. But now you can really grow your own traffic - which is essential</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>for owning your business and reducing your dependency on eBay.</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Products You Represent</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this situation, the business product you are selling is not your own creation.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You are <B>representing </B>a company that pays you a commission for every sale</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that you generate. You may belong to an <B>affiliate </B>or <B>associate </B>program or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be part of a <B>Network Marketing </B>company. (Representing a product may be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your sole business or it could be an additional income stream.)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The more exposure and credibility you can create for the product/service that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you represent, the higher the chance for a sale. And higher sales translate into</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more commission for you. Auctions are an easy and effective way to increase</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>exposure.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Highlight </B>one item through an auction. Within your listing, promote your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>merchant’s Web site address. Targeted visitors will click through to the main</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>selling site for more information or to buy other products. Each “click through”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is potential income for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Want to know what kind of products are being promoted this way? A quick</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>survey of different auction sites shows the following...</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>World’s Cheapest Ad</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Jim, a friend in Atlanta, created an information product to promote his software</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. He offered this infoproduct on eBay for one cent and created a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Dutch auction with 10 of these products. His insertion fees (at the time) were</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$2.50 and he ran these auctions for 10 days at a time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Jim and I compared costs. One week in the “Atlanta Business Chronicle” was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$56. Ten days in the “Atlanta Journal Constitution” would have cost $134. If</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Jim so desired, he could have run this same ad every day of the year for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$91.25 on one of the top Web sites in the world. Quite a bargain!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Does Jim care if he actually sells his report? (Especially for one cent which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>would be a giant pain to collect.) No way! What he is doing is <B>building</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>traffic </B>to his Web site. He attracts dozens of new visitors (i.e., potential</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyers) each week.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s look at another business that uses this strategy...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=FreeBook.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/FreeBook.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This gentleman is advertising his free book on Yahoo auctions. There is no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>charge for listing on Yahoo so this publicity costs him nothing.</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>Why does he say the book is free, and yet lists it at one cent? The answer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(even though I’m sure you knew it anyway) is that these are auction sites, <B>not</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“ad” sites. Therefore, all merchandise must have a price, no matter how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>minimal.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>His goal is crystal clear... to promote his Web site for free.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Your Professional Services</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Products are definitely the overwhelming majority of what is sold on the auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sites. But there are a few services that are auctioned as well. So if your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business involves some sort of service, an auction is a very feasible option to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consider. Use the auctions to promote <B>features </B>of your services...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Save time </B>- Time is the most precious commodity in our society. Many</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>busy people will pay exorbitant amounts of money for services. Cleaning</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services can easily be auctioned. Notice the Web site link?...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Cleaning.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Cleaning.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Supply specialized service </B>- Sometimes a particular service is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sought-after because it is so specialized that the customer doesn’t have the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>skills required to do it. In the listing below, you will find a very “specialized”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Lasik.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Lasik.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Provide a service with modern technology </B>- Here is an interesting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service. For $29.99, this service-provider will provide you with a…</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>“new beauty system that will help you select a modern</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>hair-style that revitalizes your appearance and transforms</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>you into a more attractive woman!”</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The buyer sends her picture and receives 75 shots of herself with all kinds of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>different hair styles. To make the offer more attractive he adds two bonuses - </FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>an additional “free” 25 pictures for the same price and free shipping.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) Teaching services </B>- One seller offers the opportunity to learn several</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>different professions and become certified in them. He also offers course in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>such fields as massage therapy, pressure point therapy, medical billing, fitness</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and weight training, Web design and numerous computer functions. All of his</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>listings link to the Southeastern Institute of Computer Technology and Career</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Training Web site.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>5) Auction an entire team </B>- Here is an unusual service example...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=DOTCOM.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/DOTCOM.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I have never seen the services of an entire management team being auctioned</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>before but why not? Talk about a turn-key operation!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>6) Provide keepsakes </B>- Keepsakes are always popular and this auctioneer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>takes advantage of that interest...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>"You are bidding on a 16 x 20 Photographic Reproduction</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>printed onArtist-Quality Canvas. The photo will be scanned</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>on a high definition scanner,lightly retouched if necessary,</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>and printed on Artist-Grade High Quality Canvas and a</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>protective coating applied. This makes a BEAUTIFUL GIFT or</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>ACCESSORY FOR THE HOME."</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>7) Sell services to other auction sellers </B>- There are famous marketing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stories about the 1848 gold rush in California. The majority of the people who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>made the money weren’t those out digging with a pick and shovel but those</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>who sold them the tools to do the job. You can sell these types of “shovels” to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fellow auctioneers or sellers...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>Provide necessary auction services. For example, other sellers would bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for your time to write their ads, research suggestions for domain names, create</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>easy-to-use design templates for sites, create tools to track customers’ buying</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and Web-surfing habits, or create banner ads, etc.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>Provide services for people who want to sell goods but don’t want to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>personally participate in the auction process. You can provide marketing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services at no risk to yourself and people will gladly give up a percentage of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the profit.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I have a friend who sends merchandise to me. I sell it and we split the profits. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>asked him why he didn’t sell it himself, and keep all of the money. He said he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>thought about it this way... 50% of the profit and no work or 100% and a lot of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>work, including having to learn the auction process. The former suits his needs</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the best. He is busy with other businesses and doesn’t want to take the time to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>learn.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>Provide very specialized services for people. For example, you can create</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an <B>alliance </B>with companies that ship large, bulky items. You then can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>manage the shipping needs of an auctioneer who doesn’t enjoy that part of the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. Or you can provide materials needed for shipping, like wrap or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>boxes.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>8) Sell convenience </B>- Susan and Bill are making thousands of dollars a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>year auctioning freeware and shareware that they have put on a CD. Why is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this considered a service, rather than a product? Simple. They aren’t selling</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the programs. They are selling the work they did in collecting it. After all, if it’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>on the Internet, a customer could find all of it for herself without buying their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>CD.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>9) Sell information to other companies </B>- Our time in history is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>frequently called the “Information Age.” In fact, information is the most valuable</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>commodity we have. There are lots of companies who will pay, and pay well</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for specialized information. Those companies and individuals who are skilled</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>researchers and know how to gather and report information will always be in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>demand.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What kinds of information do your customers want and need? Here is just a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>small sampling...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Surveys</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Demographics</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>Observe a Money-Making Master</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Gin Ho is an entrepreneur well worth studying. Gin is my local dry cleaner who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>came to the United States only 19 years ago, not even speaking English. He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>started his own cleaning business in a small shopping center. It is definitely a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>modest little shop and the owner, or his wife, is always there. They keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>incredibly long hours. However, Gin is a shrewd business man. He totally</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>understands that to become wealthy you need to have <B>multiple streams of</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>income.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In his case, he owns the shopping center. The rents more than make the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>monthly mortgage payment. So he has used the extra money to accelerate the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pay-off and will soon own the entire place, free and clear.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Gin has also created several private label products, including one that cleans</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>leather. He not only markets this product in his store but also through other</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>stores. Furniture stores that sell leather furniture and a couple of stores that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>specialize in leather clothing and handbags carry his label.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As a final note, Gin has four independent contractors who go and pick up and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>deliver laundry and cleaning... for an extra charge, of course. He doesn’t make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much money on the pick-up and delivery but he has a much greater volume of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cleaning.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Gin is very quiet about his activities. He was willing to share the story with me</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>when I made a couple of suggestions on how to use auctions. He now buys</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>abandoned clothing from many other cleaners. He pays the other stores the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>amount of the cleaning bill, then he sells his products through me and we split</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the profits equally. Our relationship has now developed so that I take a lot of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the clothing on consignment. It costs us nothing but the insertion fee and we</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>often make big profits.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Does Gin sometimes buy clothing that is not saleable? Sure, it happens. And</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>what does he do with it? It is a tax write-off, of course. Here is one of our ads...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Dress.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Dress.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We sold the dress for $171.02. (Why in the world didn’t the owner come back</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for a garment like this?)</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=4>Other Profitable Options</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s look at some other situations where Net auctions do a sensational job in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>promoting and building a business...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Import/Export Business </B>- The import and/or export business is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wonderful for auctions. You are dealing with unique merchandise that is not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>widely distributed. Remember, people are willing to pay more for something</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that is exclusive.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you have ties to suppliers in other countries, there is a wealth of merchandise</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that would make perfect niche products to sell. And there are all kinds of folks</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>from other parts of the world looking for someone to represent their products</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>outside their home countries. Of course, the import/export business has its</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>own rules like everything else and it is necessary to know what you are doing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>before you rush into it.</FONT>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• Business Expansion </B>- Jana Lynne and Georgina run their own partyplanning</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business. At first, their business was strictly local but as they added</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more and more choices for their customers, there were more and more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>products to sell. Some of them were suitable for mailing, and many were not.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So they created some “party planning modules” to sell on their Web site and at</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions. This offers the customer a design for an entire theme party and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>accounts for every detail. Of course, many of these products mentioned in their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>modules were available only from them. They also sell supplies at reduced</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prices. The two women use eBay’s regional centers to promote their local</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>services.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Jana Lynne and Georgina are demonstrating an important marketing strategy...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>provide <B>one-stop shopping </B>for the buyer. If a customer gets the plan from</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one place, it’s simply easier to get all the supplies there, too.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The two women have supplies, such as tablecloths, cutlery, plates and cups,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unusual food items, fireworks (in some states) balloons of every kind and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>variety. They can supply such things as moon walks, personnel such as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clowns, jugglers, fortune tellers, comedy troupes, look-a-likes, dunk tanks, a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>petting zoo and the list goes on.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You might argue that if you are a party planner in Seattle, you can’t supply</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>personnel for one in Baltimore. But you are overlooking a huge profit center, if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you don’t. You can get on the phone and make contacts in Baltimore and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>collect a <B>referral fee </B>- another potential profit stream. You could end up with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>contacts all over North America, creating income streams in every city.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For ever-greater profits, keep adding to your product and service list. Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions allow you to expand with very little risk involved.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is so easy to create all kinds of profit streams with a little creativity and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ingenuity. For example, suppose someone wants a murder mystery party.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What could you offer?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are costumes and fake weapons, such as daggers and knives. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>could offer “Poisoner’s Pie” and “Murderer’s Roast Beef.” All of the guests</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>could receive a copy of a Miss Marple book as a party favor - and you supply</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the books, naturally!</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And here’s another “expanding” example...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Anne was fed up! Every time she walked into her closet she became</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>depressed because of the clutter and mess. (I know exactly what she means!)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Every morning when she got dressed for work, she couldn’t find anything. Her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clothes were a mess. A missing shoe was common.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One Saturday, she took action. She was at the home improvement store when</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>it opened and bought everything on her long, long list. At home, she dragged</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>everything out of her closet, into the guest room, and began “project closet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>renovation.” When she finished, she was so thrilled she started on her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>husband’s closet and then on to the two kids and from there to the linen closet</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and the pantry.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Anne’s family had a tradition of a Christmas Open House. Her closets were</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>finished shortly before this annual tradition. Her proud family bragged about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their new space and every guest at the party had a closet tour. The result was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>four separate requests from friends wanting her help to fix their closets. Others</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>mentioned her efforts to friends who told others, who... we all know how</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>effective <B>word-of-mouth </B>is.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Less than one year later, Anne was a full-time closet consultant. She was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>making almost twice the amount of money that she had made in her office job,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and having a wonderful time. Much of her success results from the fact that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>she spends a lot of time understanding exactly what the closet owner <B>wants</B>.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This, of course, meant that her business had to be strictly local. Until now, that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is. Anne developed an information product which teaches her principles and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>outlines focus questionnaires. (For more information about how to develop</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your own information product, please check out <B>http://myks.sitesell.com/ </B>)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Where do you think she began selling this product? Right on the auctions, of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>course! She built a Web site so that she can continue to grow her business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profile. She perfectly exemplifies how it is possible to start at the <B>local </B>level</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and through the auctions, expand your business and reach a much larger (and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more global) audience.</FONT>
