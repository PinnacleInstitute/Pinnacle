<B><FONT size=4>Five Minutes to Start</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Before you can play the Net auction game, you have to get on the team. 
<BR>Registration is absolutely free and it only takes about five minutes to fill in some 
<BR>information. Once again, I must point out that we are using eBay rules 
<BR>primarily because the other sites have mostly copied their lead. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>STEP #1 </B>-- <B>Register. </B>There are three requirements for registration... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>1) </B>You must be 18 years old. Recently, the horrified parents of an 11 year old 
<BR>boy discovered that their son had bid over $300,000 on eBay items. The 
<BR>sellers were not amused! 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>2) </B>You must provide a credit card number. It costs nothing to browse eBay 
<BR>listings, yet to participate in any way requires a number. Buyers pay nothing to 
<BR>the auction sites. Only sellers pay charges. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>3) </B>You must have a valid e-mail address. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Next comes personal information to insert. Please note... you will be asked to 
<BR>check whether you prefer <B>SSL transcription </B>or not. The answer is yes. 
<BR><B>Secure Sockets Layer </B>makes your information much less vulnerable to the 
<BR>After-School-Hacker Club. Privacy is a tough Internet issue. Don’t make it any 
<BR>easier for the snoops to find out about you. In fact, it is wise to only shop at 
<BR>sites with SSL. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Provide eBay with your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. 
<BR>Unless you tell the truth here, you won’t be an eBay member. When you are 
<BR>buying and selling, there is frequent communication between you and your 
<BR>auction site. Depending upon your ambitions, you may want to create a 
<BR>separate e-mail address just for your auctions. It is more efficient if your 
<BR>auction messages are separate from your family reunion ones. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>eBay promises that your personal information will be given only to law 
<BR>enforcement agents or eBay’s watchdog program, “Verified Rights Owners.” 
<BR>They only reveal information if fraud is involved. Other users may need your 
<BR>contact information to complete a transaction. eBay guarantees that they will 
<BR>send you an e-mail giving you the name and full contact information of anyone 
<BR>who requests information about you. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>STEP #2 </B>-- <B>Choose your User ID.</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>STEP #3 </B>-- <B>Pick your password. </B>For safety’s sake, auction sites 
<BR>recommend the following <B>safeguards...</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>Never give your password to anyone 
<BR><B>• </B>Don’t pick anything obvious. Of course -- but what is obvious? I have often 
<BR>used the years of my children’s birthdays. How many strangers have this 
<BR>information? 
<BR><B>• </B>Use nonsensical combinations of words and numbers 
<BR><B>• </B>Change your password if you think anyone else might have it. 
<BR><B>• </B>Stay away from really weird and funky names that might turn people off. 
<BR>“Son of Sam” might be amusing to you but it also might cost you a lot of dollars! 
<BR><B>• </B>Refrain from using words that might reflect negatively on your products. 
<BR>“Garbageman” may convey an image you don’t want. 
<BR><B>• </B>Don’t make your ID too long -- “GreatguidefortheLewisandClarkexpedition” 
<BR>might be a tad difficult! 
<BR><B>• </B>Don’t use underlined names because they are a big pain. 
<BR><B>• </B>Don’t use ALL CAPS names because many Net users consider this 
<BR><B>SHOUTING.</B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>The auction sites have some rules of their own to consider… 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>They don’t want case sensitive names like SyDnEy. 
<BR><B>• </B>Foul language is prohibited. 
<BR><B>• </B>No names with just one letter. Some symbols, such as &amp; and @, are 
<BR>prohibited. 
<BR><B>• </B>IDs that use the company names, like “ebayseller,” “amazonkid” or 
<BR>“yahoocowboy” are prohibited because they seem to imply that you are an 
<BR>employee. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>STEP #4 </B>-- <B>Agree to have a personal page. </B>eBay, for example, has 
<BR>created “About Me.” The way eBay views it, their members are part of a 
<BR>community, a family. And anyone who wants to share information about 
<BR>themselves is welcome to do so with a personal Web page. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Here is what you can do with a personal Web page... 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>Create a storefront for yourself. 
<BR><B>• </B>Show off your fabulous finds. 
<BR><B>• </B>Display your items up for bid. 
<BR><B>• </B>Educate the world about your favorite hobby. 
<BR><B>• </B>Promote who you are in the eBay community. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>If you browse the eBay categories, you will see that very few people take 
<BR>advantage of this option. Privacy is such a hot issue on the Net that it seems 
<BR>like a personal page is a contradictory idea. But a personal page is an 
<BR>absolutely fabulous <B>marketing tool. </B>Take advantage of it. You get free 
<BR><B>advertising </B>on some of the most heavily-traveled consumer locales in the 
<BR>world. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Again and again, eBay urges its trading community to check feedback, to 
<BR>check the reputation of the seller. When you auction your products or services, 
<BR>you can be sure that many buyers will indeed do just that. The Internet is 
<BR>famous for its anonymity but that isn’t wise if you want to sell over the Net, 
<BR>whether on an auction or not. If your customer doesn’t trust you, she isn’t going 
<BR>to buy. Period. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>When you go to a store, do you buy brands that are familiar to you? Would you 
<BR>buy a highly technical product without knowing the company and having 
<BR>contact information easily available? Personally, if there is no way to contact 
<BR>an Internet company, I don’t buy from them -- ever. The more <B>confidence </B>you 
<BR>inspire, the more money you will make. So what’s the million-dollar answer to 
<BR>the question, “Do you want a personal page?” Yes, yes, YES! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>OK. Now what do you put on your page? 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>1) </B>Be creative and think about what would inspire confidence. Definitely 
<BR>include pictures. Allow your customers to see you as a human being like them. 
<BR>This is very reassuring. For example, if you sell dolls, definitely include a 
<BR>picture of yourself surrounded by dozens of your little friends. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>2) </B>The best kind of information reinforces your expertise. Perhaps you sell 
<BR>cars, own a garage and can personally verify the condition of everything you 
<BR>sell. Or you teach classes on pottery and ceramics, which you also auction. 
<BR>You have written a book on antique jewelry and you sell bracelets and 
<BR>necklaces. You own a restaurant and you sell specialty food items and 
<BR>cookbooks. 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>• </B>Show pictures of items you have successfully sold in the past, and always 
<BR>mention your Web site, if you have one. 
<BR><B>• </B>Use testimonials if you have them. What you say about yourself will never be 
<BR>as believable as what someone else says. 
<BR><B>• </B>Don’t use those hokey, phony ones, “Joe S. of Utah says ...” Nobody, but 
<BR>nobody, believes those. Use pictures, if you can. Provide contact information. 
<BR><B>• </B>Use your imagination. Record some of your fans talking, and use it as a 
<BR>testimonial. 
<BR><B>• </B>Be subtle. But if you have a business or a Web page, always include 
<BR>references to it. For example, if you specialize in paperweights, you might say 
<BR>something like… 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR></FONT><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>“After several years in the business, I have learned 
<BR>how to recognize the most valuable paper weights. 
<BR>In fact, if you would like to read my article on 
<BR>‘The Ten Most Valuable Paper Weights in North America 
<BR>and How to Recognize Them,’ you can download it for 
<BR>free on my Web site paperweightking.com.”</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B>STEP #5 </B>-- <B>Provide your credit card number. </B>The fees for selling an 
<BR>item are very minimal. In fact, selling on an auction site has to be the biggest 
<BR><B>bargain </B>in town. Sellers are charged an <B>insertion fee </B>when a product is 
<BR>placed for auction. If it sells, they are charged a <B>final value fee, </B>based upon 
<BR>the final price of the item. Each seller receives an invoice for the previous 
<BR>month’s fees. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>In my first week in business I made over $1,000. (Actually, it was $1,027.53.) 
<BR>Out of that amount, I paid eBay $38. A very minimal cost for doing business! 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>So where do you stand now? 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>You are registered, have your personal page and are ready to begin an actual 
<BR>transaction. Actually, you are more than ready. You are roaring to start. 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR>Now here’s a strange-sounding statement... <B>The best way to make money</B><B>is to spend some money! </B>So get ready to buy something you really want… </FONT>
