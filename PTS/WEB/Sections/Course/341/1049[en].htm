<B><FONT size=4><B><FONT size=4>Become an Expert</FONT></B>&nbsp; 
<BR></FONT></B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are going to succeed at the auction game, you must understand your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>category, the value of particular items and the market. In short, you must</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>become an <B>expert!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Is your heart sinking as you read those words? Perhaps you are saying, “Well,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that lets me out, I’m not an expert in anything.” Don’t despair. You don’t need</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to become a world famous expert, especially not all at once. In fact, you don’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have to know a whole lot at first.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Just remember the&nbsp;se pointers and you will be fine...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Keep your spending low.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Reduce risk.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Refrain from buying any large amounts of merchandise until you know what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Don’t use your lack of knowledge as an excuse to take no action at all.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, I am interested in books. I recently spoke with the father of a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>friend who is an expert in the rare book field. He’s actually one of the top</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>experts in the world. This man is in his 70’s and has been a book fanatic since</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>early childhood and a book dealer his entire adult life. I will never know as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much as he does. I will probably never know a fourth of what he knows. But</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that doesn’t prevent me from making money by selling books or anything else</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at auctions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be prudent but don’t get “paralysis of analysis”! All successful businesses</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have two things in common… <B>passion and effort. </B>Narrow your choice(s)</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>down to the best fit and then go for it!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Choose Your Niche</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now it is time to be serious about your choices. If you don’t really love what</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you are buying and selling, learning the necessary knowledge will be a chore</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>rather than a joy. And if it is a chore, you won’t stick with it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are some “rules” or guide-lines to follow when choosing your niche…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Start small </B>- Begin with only one, or at most two, categories. Don’t deal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in multiple categories until you know what you are doing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Make sure you are truly fascinated </B>- If you don’t feel passion for your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>subject it will frankly be a big drag. Learning about something you aren’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>interested in is too much like school, isn’t it? Did you just memorize</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information to get a good grade? Information <B>you forgot as soon as…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… you ran out of the test room?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This listing clearly shows why you need to love your merchandise...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Yankee.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Yankee.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Is this bat worth $3,000? I have no idea. But I do know that studying baseball</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>memorabilia is not appealing to me. However, many people are obviously</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fascinated with it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You also won’t fool your buyers. They will know it you are doing it “just for the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>money.” Your lack of enthusiasm will show through in your listings and affect</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your sales. It may sound corny in our cynical age but this is really golden</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>advice. Be passionate about what you do.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Don’t limit yourself </B>- Categories are very helpful but don’t <B>limit </B>yourself</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>by focusing only on one field of interest. In my case, I spend time studying the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions to see what is selling really well. Then if I have a good source for that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>particular product, I will begin selling it. If it is general merchandise, I may not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>need to know much about it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, here is a profitable item of mine...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Briefcase.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Briefcase.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I have run this&nbsp;&nbsp; auction item again and again. I begin the price at $.99 and it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>continues to rise as the bidding becomes more frenzied. I run this same listing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>each time and have made thousands of dollars with it. The customer gets a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>very good value because the briefcase is attractive and all leather.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What do I know about leather goods? Not much. But this is a type of general,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>inexpensive merchandise that doesn’t require in-depth knowledge. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>crucial strategy is to figure out what people <B>want </B>to buy and sell it to them!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>A great tip </B>- whenever you list an item, you must declare a category for it. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spent hours searching eBay looking for appropriate categories until I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>accidentally discovered the “Category Overview” page. For some reason, it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>isn’t well known but it has saved me enormous amounts of time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The url is <B>http://listings.ebay.com/aw/listings/overview.html</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To give you an idea of how valuable this knowledge is, look at an item that I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have sold...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=EyeMassage.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/EyeMassage.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is an eye massager that can improve vision, reduce wrinkles, etc. Where</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in the world does a product like this fit? Without the “Category Overview” page,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>too much of my time would have been spent seeking an appropriate spot. (By</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the way, I put it in Health and Beauty.)</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>What Do You Want to Sell?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You may not have a clue about what you want to sell. Or maybe you do, but</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you are unsure whether it is profitable or not. For both situations,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>researching </B>Net auction sites is critical. That’s how you will find the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>information you need to make the right decisions.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As you can see, it’s not difficult to find something that fits with your interests.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The challenge is <B>narrowing </B>your choice to the best fit - the one that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>nourishes your passion and feeds your profit line.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How and where to begin?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Simple. Start researching on eBay. It has more categories than anyone else</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and enough information to start an avalanche of ideas rolling in your head.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Keep in mind that each category has a sub-category which in turn usually has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>a sub-sub-category. You may be surprised where you end up!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Who Are Your Customers?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Suppose you decide to sell the following item advertised as a “Navy Seal</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>multifunctional tool”...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Knife.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Knife.jpg" align=baseline border=0> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Who might be interested in this? What about campers? Hikers? Sporting</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>goods outlets? Scouts? Martial Arts practitioners? Mountain climbers?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Women? Fishermen? Boaters? Kitchen workers? Divers? Hunters?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Brainstorm ideas about the people in each category. If you choose campers,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ask yourself...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What are their interests?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Are they more likely men or women?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What is their age range?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What is their income range?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What do they want, and not want, from their camping experience?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this way, you get a picture of your customer, and can direct your listing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>toward his needs. How could a camper use this tool to have a better camping</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>experience? To open a soft drink or a wine bottle? Cut a fishing line? Trim a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>branch?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you understand what your customer wants, you will be in a better position to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>give it to him. A powerful “trick” to help you write an ad is to create an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>imaginary person and address all your copy to him.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s pretend you are writing an ad for campers. Create a guy named Jeff.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Jeff and three of his buddies…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>…are out in the woods, playing weekend frontiersmen.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What is going on? Imagine them unshaven, sitting around the fire at night,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>telling jokes and talking sports. How would Jeff use the Navy Seal tool? He</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>might use the knife blade to sharpen a stick to stir the fire. He would definitely</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>use the bottle opener.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Picturing your customers makes it easier to understand what your customers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want, rather than writing to the faceless “them.” Always try to become your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers. Put yourself into their <B>mindsets.</B></FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Are Price and Value the Same Thing?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Items can be hot with a high price tag. The value doesn’t necessarily have to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>correspond. Whenever you can jump on a “hot” trend - do it! The ultimate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>profit comes when you catch a trend <B>just as it is beginning.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you determine true value? There are countless books and magazines</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to use as resource material. There are also media programs, like the “Antique</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Road Show.” Online, there are several reference options. For example…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.collectingchannel.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.collectoronline.com/</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/cmart/</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Just be aware that these sources are only guides, not the final word. For your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction business, the only thing that matters is what your buyers will pay for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>My experience has been that researching auction sites is the most productive</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>use of your time. You can view current and past sales. Let’s use our Navy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Seal tool to illustrate. Type those words into an auction search function and it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will give you all kinds of information in a concise, compact form.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Some of the auction sites feature resource information as well. It may or may</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not be helpful depending on what you wish to sell. Ask yourself these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Is there some big trend that I can capitalize on? For example, “USA Today”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reported that when “Seinfeld” (a T.V. show) was nearing its end, everything</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>related to the show sky-rocketed in value.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>What about timing? Should I sell this now, or wait and sell it later? This can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>be tricky. If it’s hot today, it may be even hotter in 20 years but do you want to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wait that long?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Is a company discontinuing an item that I might want to buy and stockpile?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Perhaps there is a recall associated with this item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Is there a growing interest in something that I might detect early in the game?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Elvis memorabilia wasn’t all that valuable until he died. The King seems to be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>worth <B>much more dead...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>... than alive!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Do your hard thinking before you commit to action!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Report Violations</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Since auction sites can’t possibly monitor all the items they are selling, they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>rely on the <B>membership </B>to help them. Why would anyone report another</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>seller? Perhaps they are your competition! Or they may be infringing on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone else’s property and you don’t believe in that. Or some people just</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>believe that everyone should <B>follow the rules</B>... period.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How does the reporting process work?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Each site has its own rules for reporting behavior. The most advanced of these</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is eBay’s <B>VeRO (Verified Rights Owner) </B>program. If you own “intellectual</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>property,” you can be a VeRO member. This means that if someone is using</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your ad copy, your course information, your logo or copyrighted item, you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>do something about it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Members of the VeRO program include hundreds of law enforcement officials</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and representatives from companies who are very zealous in the protection of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their property. eBay doesn’t prosecute people but it will suspend them</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>permanently. Federal governments sometimes prosecute offenders.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You can report suspicious activity. The easiest way is to go to the <B>Community</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Watch Forum...</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>http://pages.ebay.com/help/community/index.html </B>.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What if you mistakenly break the rules? Chances are nothing will happen, if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can convince eBay that is was an honest mistake.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Repeat offenders </B>don’t receive the benefit of the doubt.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Are you ready to focus totally on what you want from your business? Without 
<BR>being crystal clear, you will end up floundering and lost in a fog. That will <B>not</B>happen to you, if you spend some time with the next chapter...</FONT>
