<B><FONT size=4>The Bidding Process</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The word “easy” keeps popping up when you talk about Net auctions. It’s easy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to register and it’s easy to bid on an auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A look at a sample bid confirms this...</FONT> 
<P><IMG alt=Frank.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Frank.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Each item will state a <B>minimum </B>bid. In the example above, it’s $190. If you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>agree to match this bid, two things happen. The auction site asks you to review</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your bid and then to give your password and user ID.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In a very short time, you will receive a confirmation e-mail from the auction site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As was mentioned earlier, there is <B>no charge </B>for bidding.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Bid Increments</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The auction sites have bidding <B>increments. </B>eBay, for example, has the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>following guidelines...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=IncrementChart.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/IncrementChart.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This means that if the item you are bidding on is currently at $261, and you bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$262, your bid would be refused. You must bid a minimum of $266 to stay in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the game.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you place a bid, do you win? The answer is a loud and clear... <B>maybe.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You only win if you have the <B>highest </B>bid when the auction closes. One great</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>feature of Internet auctions, however, is that they will notify you if you are outbid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and by how much. Got to keep that auction frenzy going somehow.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Your Computer Will Bid For You</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Proxy bidding </B>is an interesting feature of auction sites. Picture this...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is a signed edition of “The Firm” by John Grisham being auctioned. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have a signed collection of all his works, except this one. You are desperate to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have it and are willing to pay up to $325 for it. At this point, though, the bidding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is only $202.50.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What is your best strategy? Are you going to sit by your monitor, waiting and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>watching? Should you bid the $325 right now? Thanks to proxy bidding, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>don’t have to do either. To win the book, all you must do is click “proxy</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bidding” below the minimum bid amount and enter your proxy bid of $325. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>computer will bid for you. Whenever your arch-rival bids on your book, the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>computer will automatically bid the next accepted amount for you. And each</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>time the computer bids for you, it notifies you via e-mail.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t worry. Your maximum bid is a secret. When and if the price exceeds</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$325, the computer will not bid any longer.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Reserve Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When bidding on an item, you will sometimes see “Reserve” by the bid.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whenever a seller lists an item, she must list a minimum bid. This is not the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>same as a reserve. A reserve is a price <B>below </B>which the seller will not sell</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and the amount is kept secret during the auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You will often see some strange items sold this way. When I was a novice, I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>was startled to see a diamond bracelet with a minimum price of $1. However,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>there was a large reserve price on this bracelet.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Why do sellers do this?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>One reason is to have a <B>lower insertion fee </B>to pay. Another reason is to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>create <B>interest </B>on the part of the buyers. Here is an example of a sale item</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that deliberately was started low just to create interest ...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=NewPalm.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/NewPalm.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you look at the line entitled, “First bid,” you will see that the seller began the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bidding at 99 cents. For a “new/barely used” palm pilot? The seller absolutely</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>did not expect to receive this tiny amount. Instead, he set the reserve high</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enough to achieve whatever profit he thinks is reasonable. As you can see,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the current price is $360 and the reserve isn’t met yet.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here are other examples of reserve items...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Chevy.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Chevy.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is a typical reserve auction. After the description is the notation “Res.”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This lets prospective buyers know that it has a reserve price.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On this car, the reserve price isn’t met at $10,100...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=10100.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/10100.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If it is not met, the car will not sell at the end of the auction, even though it has</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>received 29 bids.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Are reserve auctions a good selling strategy for you?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A reserve seems like a really cool idea. You can sit a tiny minimum price and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>yet be covered so that you don’t have to sell your Rolls Royce for $10. The</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>downside, however, is that there are many buyers who will not bid on reserve</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>items. They “don’t want to waste time playing games,” as one buyer put it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I once bid on an item seven times in a couple of minutes, and each time</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>received the “reserve not yet met” response. I gave up in disgust and I haven’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bid on an item with a reserve price since then.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This is an individual decision, without question. But as a seller, be aware that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many potential buyers will pass you by. Reserve auctions are definitely in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>minority.</FONT> 
<BR></FONT><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Bidding Strategies</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Really serious auction players and collectors develop <B>winning </B>strategies to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make sure they get the items they are craving. They manage to buy items that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>they can then resell for a nice profit. Mastering effective bidding strategies</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>means more cash for your pocket. Here are a few to consider...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Strategy #1 </B>-  <B>A few cents can make the difference. </B>Most buyers bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in nice, round numbers like $5.50 or $10.75. But those who study the auctions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>learn that a few cents can make a difference. Instead of bidding $12.50, bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>$12.53.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes these few cents will be a difference between winning and losing.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Power tip… </B>Don’t use this strategy at the very beginning of an auction. Wait</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>until near the end of the bidding period. Why? Because your competitors will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>realize what you are doing, and you will lose your edge.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Strategy #2 </B>-  <B>Snipe cautiously. </B>A last-minute flurry of bidding is called</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“sniping.” This is the fine art of waiting until the last possible second to defeat</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the current high bidder. Many scream that it is not playing fair but it is totally</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>within the rules of the auction. And it can be a lot of fun. Sniping is the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>electronic equivalent of parents in the toy store fighting over the last Robo</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Laser Geek on Christmas eve! Be prepared, though. You may be on the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wrong end of a snipe one of these days!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you are a serious sniper, try this next tactic. Computers take a few seconds to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>record bids so the bid entered 10 – 20 seconds before the end of the auctions</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>usually wins. Many people take this very seriously. They use pagers, alarm</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clocks, etc., to sound the alert. Some even schedule their entire afternoon</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>around an expiring auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Then they may regale the crowd in the chat rooms <B>the next day…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… with play-by-play tales of their savvy moves!</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Strategy #3 Use the two screen strategy. </B>In the event of a bidding</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>war, really serious bidders use this strategy to acquire a treasured item. First,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>make sure your clock is set to the time of the auction site. You wouldn’t want to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>miss out on your treasure because you lost track of time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you press the Control (Ctrl) and N key together (Command and N together for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Mac users), you will open a <B>second screen </B>on your browser. You can use</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one screen to bid and the other to watch a flurry of last minute bids. To keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>up with the bids, keep hitting the <B>reload or refresh </B>button on your computer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In this way, you know what all your opponents are doing. Feel your adrenaline</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>spike!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you use this tactic, be aware that it takes precious seconds to fill in your ID</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and password so have that part of your screen filled in to save time. And...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>good luck!</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Strategy #4 Don’t bid high and early. </B>If there are several people who</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are determined to acquire the item that you want, you will only be forcing the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>price up and up. Wait until closer to the end to make a determined series of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bids.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you are selling, you will see this happen again and again. Many buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wait until late in the game to bid just because they don’t want to run the price</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>up.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Strategy #5 Don’t get carried away</B>. Keep some perspective. Don’t bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>more than the item is worth to you. Keep in mind that if you lose, there will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>probably be another one available tomorrow.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Why am I including so much information about bidding? Simple. <B>The more</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>you know about the auction process, the more effectively you will</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>sell. </B>I can’t repeat that too often.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Ken constantly advises that the better you know your customers, the more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>successful you will be in your business. In short, you need to know how your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customers feel and behave. You have to get into your customer’s <B>mindset.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff><B><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You need to understand your customers’ thoughts and feelings, figure out their</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>personality type, sense what makes them tick. Basically, you have to get inside</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>their heads. Once you know your customers, you can anticipate their wants,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appeal to the right emotions and show them how your product/service will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>benefit them. That’s what effective <B>PREselling </B>is all about.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For more information about PREselling, see <B>http://auctions.sitesell.com/</B></FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Another powerful reason for understanding the what’s-what about bidding is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that as a seller you might want to stock up on good deals that you see for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>resale later. Here is a great example. This seller bought 50 pairs of earrings in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>9 days. She bought them for resale...</FONT>
<P><IMG style="WIDTH: 657px; HEIGHT: 77px" height=77 alt=bulk.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/bulk.jpg" width=730 align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Or consider this approach. There is a <B>“Wholesale” </B>category on eBay where</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sellers can buy items to resell later...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Wholesale.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Wholesale.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Personally, I prefer to find my own sources. But some sellers beg to differ.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>They insist this is a profitable way to buy merchandise.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Again I have to emphasize, <B>really know your prices before you invest</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>in any merchandise.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Buyer’s Remorse</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Retracting a bid is a huge no-no. Nothing can ruin your trading career more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>quickly than backing out on your bids. Why? This business runs on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>reputation </B>and if you get a bad one, you will be damaged, possibly beyond</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>repair. Many buyers won’t do business with you. In the worst case, you can be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>suspended from the auction site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So it’s important to know the “ins and outs” of withdrawing a bid...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) Acceptable grounds for retraction </B>-  Retracting a bid is so serious that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I <B>strongly </B>advise you not to do it unless under extreme circumstances. Here</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are a few “sort-of” acceptable “grounds”...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) </B>You accidentally enter a wrong bid amount. For instance, you bid $99.50</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>instead of $9.95. However, if you retract a bid because you “meant” to bid</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>something else -  you bid $29.95 but meant to bid $25.95 -  you won’t get any</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sympathy and you will be judged harshly by your fellow auctioneers.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) </B>The item description of something you’re bidding on has changed a lot.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sellers will sometimes add to the description of an item. If this changes,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bidders will sometimes withdraw their bids.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>iii) </B>You cannot verify the seller’s identity, or she won’t respond to any of your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>questions. Even though this is sometimes accepted by sites as a legitimate</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>excuse, you really should figure all this out before bidding, not after.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Unacceptable grounds for retraction </B>-  There is no sympathy if…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>a) </B>You change your mind about the item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>b) </B>You decide you can’t really afford it.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>c) </B>You bid a little higher than you meant to.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Make your decisions <B>clearly </B>before you bid.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) Failure to comply </B>-  “They can’t make me buy it”... this statement is quite</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>true. However, watch your step here. Auctions sites consider a bid a contract</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and expect the bidder to fill out a form explaining the reason for the withdrawal.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If you absolutely must retract, do it before the auction is over to reduce the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>damage. It is unfair to leave the seller hanging after the auction is over. Even</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>if your explanation is accepted, it will go into your feedback profile and make</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>future sellers and buyers wary of dealing with you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A seller may always refuse to sell to any particular person, and needs no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reason for her refusal. You might find this happening to you a lot if you decide</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to retract your bids.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Twice I have bid on items and then found them elsewhere at a cheaper price. I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>decided to honor my more expensive bids. In one case, I was outbid and got</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>off the hook. Phew! The other time, I just paid the extra and vowed to do better</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>research in the future. I am not telling you this story to be nominated for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sainthood! <B>It’s just smart business practice.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now let’s see where we can apply our bidding strategies…</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Kinds of Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The typical auction is the nice straightforward kind of winner-takes-all.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>However, there are special auctions, and one kind in particular is critical for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>any seller who wants to reach the top pinnacle in the auction business.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is a quick overview of the different kinds...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>1) Reserve Auction</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>We have already explained this kind of transaction. Reserve auctions are a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>very small minority and are usually reserved for <B>higher-priced </B>items.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>2) Dutch Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Dutch auctions are vitally important to us. They are the key to substantial</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>income generation!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Dutch auctions are very confusing to understand at first so don’t despair. (We</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>will discuss them more in the chapters ahead.) A Dutch auction is one in which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the seller offers <B>more than one </B>of the items she is selling. For example, if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you have 25 Nascar models to sell, you can create 25 different listings, or you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>can put them all in a Dutch auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sometimes it is appropriate to create single listings. Other times, Dutch</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auctions are the way to go. There are different strategies for either approach...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>i) Rules </B>-  On most sites, brand new traders cannot participate in a Dutch</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction. For example, on eBay, you must be a member for 60 days and have</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>at least 50 feedback points. This restriction isn’t to pick on the “new kids.” It’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>because it takes some skill and practice to manage them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There can be no reserve price in a Dutch auction. There is no proxy bidding,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>either. The winners in a Dutch auction purchase the item at the <B>lowest</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>successful bid.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This can get a little confusing, so stay with me here. First, let’s make up an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>imaginary auction just for the sake of explanation. After that, we’ll look at some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>actual auctions...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Example 1... </B>Let’s say that Jane is auctioning 10 pairs of earrings, with an</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>opening bid of $5. If 10 people (or less) bid $5, no problem. They all get a set</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of earrings.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Example 2.... </B>What if 16 people bid on those 10 sets of earrings? Who gets</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>them and for what price? We’ll pretend the bids went like this...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer A - $13.50</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer B - $12.75</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer C - $12.25</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer D - $11.80</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer E - $11.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer F - $10.43</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer G - $9.10</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer H - $7.50</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer J - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer K - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer L - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer M - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer N - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer O - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer P - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyer Q - $5.00</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Buyers <B>A to K </B>get the earrings. But why would J and K get earrings, and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>buyers L to Q not get them, when they bid as much as J and K? It all has to do</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with the chronological sequence. The <B>first buyers who bid a winning</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>price </B>are the lucky ones. Perhaps J and K bid on Tuesday morning, and the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>others didn’t bid until Tuesday afternoon or sometime on Wednesday.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now for the tough question. What does everybody pay for these earrings?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The price is based on the <B>lowest </B>successful bid which in this case was $5.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Therefore, everybody pays $5.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Yes, you read it correctly. <B>Everybody! </B>Even though Buyer A bid $13.50, she</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>only has to pay $5. <B>Arrgh!...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>…WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I promise, it will get very clear when you start to wheel and deal in the Dutch</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction arena. For now, just be aware that Dutch auctions are something you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>want to master. They are the source of super profits.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Let’s look at two actual Dutch auctions that might make this whole thing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>clearer.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Situation A… </B>This seller began her auction with 5 digital cameras and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>opened the bidding at one cent (knowing full well that the cameras would climb</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>much higher than that)...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Camera.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Camera.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>74 people bid on the cameras. The five winners are listed below. The two top</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bidders offered to pay $55 and $52. The next three bidders offered $50.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Mini-quiz... Did they pay different prices? Or did the five people all pay the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>same thing? If the latter, how much did they pay?...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Winners.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Winners.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The answer is... (drum roll)... all five people paid $50, even though two of them</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>were willing to pay more. Why? Because $50 was the lowest successful bid!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here is our second example, an auction in which I bid...</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Jewelry.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Jewelry.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The seller offered 250 garnet pendants for one cent, and the # of bids is 283</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bids. The bidding stayed at one cent for days, and that is what I bid as well.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The pendant sold for $2.50, since this was the lowest successful bid. The top</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bidder was willing to pay $25, yet it only cost $2.50. I’m sure she was</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>delighted.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A word of caution, however -  if you ever bid a high price on an auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(assuming that you won’t have to pay that much) you may be unpleasantly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>surprised. <B>Don’t bid any sum unless you are willing to pay it!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There are three other interesting comments to make about this particular Dutch</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction example. These details affect your profit as a seller...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>The listing above has the number <B>283 </B>in the bid column. This is another</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>difference between a Dutch and a regular auction. The number of bids is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>actually the number of people. But each of the 283 may have made multiple</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>bids, and so there might be 1,000 requests for earrings for all you know.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Did I win? No, I didn’t because I didn’t bid high enough. I would definitely</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>have been willing to pay much more than my one cent bid but because I didn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>constantly follow this auction, I lost track of the bidding. Each day, I received</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>an “update” from eBay recapping my sales and my bids. However, this isn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>nearly as powerful as receiving <B>constant </B>updates, which is what happens</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>with a single auction item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>This reality can depress the price if you are a seller. How come? When there</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is only one item for sale, the sites immediately notify the losing bidders when</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone bids higher. This doesn’t occur in a Dutch auction. Therefore, your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>prices may not move up as quickly.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>It may cause a seller to gnash her teeth in frustration to see that these buyers</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>were willing to pay so much more. That’s just the way it is. Those are the rules</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>of a Dutch auction, and we either have to abide by them, or not participate.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>ii) When to use Dutch Auctions </B>-  Dutch auctions may be an important</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>wealth tool but you will only want to use them when you have <B>tested </B>a certain</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>product and are <B>confident </B>that you know what you are doing. For example, if</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you have never sold solid gold widgets and you auction 5,000 of them, you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>may be in for a real shock. There is an insertion fee for all 5,000 of them - </FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>whether you sell them or not!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Dutch auction is definitely a <B>power strategy </B>but one to use prudently. If it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sounds intimidating, don’t worry about it. As you gain more and more auction</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>experience, your comfort level will rise and you will become more</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>experimental. Personally, my largest Dutch auction was for 150 items. But I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>am very careful.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Key learning point... <B>TEST, TEST, TEST!</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>3) Reverse Dutch Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Reverse Dutch auctions are sometimes found at specialty sites, but they are</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not very popular. In a reverse auction, the price begins dropping at <B>specified</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>intervals. The buyer’s job is to figure out when the price is acceptably low.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Wait too long and someone else will buy the widget.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It is similar to a Dutch auction, however, in that everybody will buy at the lowest</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>price. However, you had better be willing to pay whatever you have bid. Be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sure of your bid -  don’t hope or expect the price to drop because it may not.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So far, this doesn’t seem to be an especially popular format. I have yet to talk</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to anyone who has participated in such an auction.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>4) Restricted Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Restricted auctions are usually for “adult” auctions. To even look at the items in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>restricted auctions, the site requires credit card information which means the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>browser must be 18 years old. (This is the Internet auction equivalent of</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>putting “Penthouse” magazine in plain brown wrappers behind the counter.)</FONT>
<P><IMG alt=Restricted.jpg hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/341/Restricted.jpg" align=baseline border=0>
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>5) Private Auctions</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In a regular auction, the identity of the bidders is available for all to know. In a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>private auction, this isn’t the case. There are usually two reasons for a private</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>If the item is very expensive, the bidders may not want the world to know</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that they can afford a Van Gogh.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>In the case of adult auctions, the bidders may not want anyone to know they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are bidding on a particular item.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Please note that Dutch auctions cannot be private.</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Side Deals</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>By “side deals,” we mean those transactions that occur <B>outside </B>the regular</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>auction.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As you might imagine, the auction sites are very opposed to side deals. They</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>lose revenue and control whenever this occurs. If you participate in side deals,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the auction site may suspend you, if it finds out. And, if something goes wrong,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the site won’t help you in any way.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Of course, these transactions occur all the time. My second week in the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>business, I received an e-mail from a customer. She said that she had no</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>hope of winning the regular auction for an item of mine because she couldn’t</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>afford it. She asked me if I would copy the videos for $75.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>I was green as grass and didn’t even think about eBay’s reaction to this so I</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cheerfully agreed. <B>Consider this as personal proof…</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>… that you can run afoul of the law without even</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>meaning to!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So are you biting at the bit to auction your first item? Let’s get to it…</FONT>
