<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>It’s NOT about selling...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>It s about PREselling.</FONT> 
<BR>- Ken Evoy 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>To be successful, <B>the needs of your target group have to be your #1 Priority. </B>Your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>desire to earn income comes second.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Use great content to create an open-to buy/hire mindset in your visitor. Deliver strong,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appropriate editorial content that <B>PREsells</B>.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>PRE</B>sold visitors convert more easily and more frequently into paying customers - </FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>higher <B>Conversion Rates (CR) </B>– which is exactly the result that your online business</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>has to achieve in order to flourish.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Bottom line?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>There is no such thing as “passerby traffic” on the Net. You have to build and attract</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>warm, willing-to-buy traffic on an ongoing basis.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A great content site helps you achieve that goal. It increases targeted traffic, which</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>produces more sales, which in turn produces more income. In other words, the key is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to develop great content that leads to the money-making click...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Valuable Content = Credible Recommendation = Turned ON customer = High </B><B>CR</B><B>.</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Don’t push your visitors to the click, make them <B>want </B>to click through. It makes all the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>difference if your visitors feel that it’s their idea to deliver your <B>Most Wanted Response</B></FONT> <FONT size=3><B>(MWR) </B>- in other words, what you most want your visitor to do on your site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your <B>MWR </B>is to get your visitors to click through to your order page (or your particular</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>income generation source) so that you can make the sale!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And it all begins with effective PREselling...</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Understand The Difference Between…</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>PREselling And Selling</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As we discussed earlier, people use the Net as a searching tool. They search for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>credible high-value information or solutions that can fulfill a wish that they hold dearly or</FONT> <FONT size=3>solve a troublesome problem that they are experiencing. Surfers, for the most part, <B>do</B></FONT> <FONT size=3><B>not know </B>who or what can provide this - they just know that they want to find a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>trustworthy </B>someone or something that can make it happen.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>That’s the winning advantage of a content-rich site. It clearly shows to your visitors that</FONT> <FONT size=3>you understand their search for quality answers to their questions... and that you aim to</FONT> <FONT size=3>provide exactly that. A content-rich site builds trust and credibility. In your visitors’</FONT> <FONT size=3>eyes, you are a knowledgeable expert who cares!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What happens then when a visitor arrives at a content site that is really just one big</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sales site?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Put yourself in that visitor’s shoes for a moment. She does not see inspiring, relevant,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>editorial content - she sees only a sales effort.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>But she was searching for content!</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>Selling… Patience is Golden!</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Selling </B>is trying to get the sale. Before you sell, PREsell. While “selling” might be your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>first priority, it does <B>not </B>come first. Your site’s first job is to satisfy your visitors’ needs</FONT> <FONT size=3>and then lead them to your <B>Most Wanted Response. </B>It’s only at that point that selling</FONT> <FONT size=3>enters the picture.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Most people, as you can well imagine, resist sales efforts. So if your content is heavily</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>pitching something, visitors will resist you rather than <B>embrace </B>you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Add to that resistance, as well, feelings of frustration and annoyance because she didn’t</FONT> <FONT size=3>find what she was looking for. She wanted information not a sales pitch!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Simply put... pure selling does not work right off the bat. You need to warm up your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>visitors and you do that by…</FONT> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=4>PREselling… The Profitable Heat Wave</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>PREselling</B><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">, </FONT></B>on the other hand, <B>warms up your visitor </B>with high-value information that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>fosters trust and credibility. Your information fulfills a wish and/or provides a much</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>sought-after solution for her. As a result of this positive/beneficial experience, the visitor</FONT> <FONT size=3>begins to <B>like and respect </B>you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Great content encourages your visitor to think about you as a “friend” making a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>recommendation rather than a stranger making a sales pitch. And if you create a truly</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>info-rich site, you’ll actually become a trusted expert, sharing your wealth of information.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Effective PREselling creates an <B>open-to-buy (or open-to-hire) </B>frame of mind in your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>visitor and gets the click through to your monetization model. It’s this “openness” to find</FONT> <FONT size=3>out more about you and your business that produces higher <B>Conversion Rates </B>and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>generates more income for you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The key is to reinforce your credibility to your visitor/potential customer every step of the</FONT> <FONT size=3>way. To accomplish this, get inside your visitor’s head and think about how she will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>react to your PREselling efforts.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whatever you do, consider the impact on your visitor...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If it does not make her more “open to buy or hire,” don’t do it. PREsell your way to high</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Conversion Rates</B><B><FONT face="Times New Roman">.</FONT></B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>It’s easy to summarize the whole point of effective PREselling with this question...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Which person would you respond to?</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A stranger with a sales pitch...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>or...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A knowledgeable friend making a recommendation?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>No matter what your business may be, the key is to building targeted traffic is…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Deliver excellent content that pulls in warm, motivated visitors, who become PREsold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about you and your business and who then buy your products/services, or click on your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>ads, or visit your merchant’s site or whatever other monetization models you use.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Successful PREselling is all about looking after the needs of your visitors <B>first </B>and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>foremost, and putting “the sale” <B>second</B>. Believe it or not, although this seems</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>paradoxical, it is only by following this mantra that you will actually begin to earn real</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>income on the Net.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In short... Take care of the needs of your audience. Good things will follow. <B>Give,</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>then take</B>.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So here’s the million dollar question…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Where do you find all these great words, all this great content? And the answer is…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>inside you!</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Because <B>you </B>know stuff other people don’t... things people would pay to know.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You might have learned it “on the job” or through your hobby. There’s a good chance</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>that you don’t even realize what you know. It’s often right under your nose. Everyone</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is an expert about something.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As an example, let’s assume that you have a rather unusual area of expertise. You love</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete. Yes, cement! It’s been your hobby, your passion, for years...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Concrete statues. Concrete painting. Decorative concrete. Concrete in the garden.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Repairing concrete. The various types of concrete. Hand trowels. Things to do with</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cement blocks. Concrete trade shows. Concrete and swimming pools. Concrete</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>molds. Cleaning concrete. Ready mixed concrete. Concrete countertops.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Anyway, let’s say that you decide to create a theme-based site that is all about</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete. Your home page explains how your site is <B>the </B>site for everything</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete, from structural to esthetic.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You also build lots of content pages – each one focuses on a keyword that a searcher</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>might use to find your theme.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT color=#0033ff><FONT size=4>(SIDEBAR!)</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff><B>Site Build It! </B>makes it a snap to identify profitable keywords for your theme (i.e.,</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>keywords that many people are searching for but that very few sites provide information</FONT></FONT> <FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>about). Just click on a button, and <B>SBI! </B>does the research for you! Hours of tedious</FONT></FONT> <FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>research reduced to minutes. And all you have to do is wait for the results!</FONT></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3><FONT color=#0033ff>http://buildit.sitesell.com/</FONT></FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>For example, your page about concrete statues explains all about how to make and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>repair striking statues for the home and garden. You could even expand it into an entire</FONT> <FONT size=3>“Statue Section,” with a page on the history of concrete statues and another one about</FONT> <FONT size=3>how to market and sell the statues that the visitor makes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The main point, though, is that you create truly excellent, high-value content that</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>delivers what your reader sought at the Search Engines. See! It happened again! By</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>writing about a niche that you know and love, the content is easy.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>OK, a second “concrete” example that comes at you from a different angle...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>John A. Smith is a passionate lover of all things concrete, and owner of “Smith’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Concrete Repair Service.” Mr. Smith’s company repairs foundations, retaining walls,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>driveways, statues, swimming pools - heck, if it’s concrete and it’s busted, he’ll fix it!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The first thing of note is this...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Smith’s “Concrete Repair Service” is a locally-based service, but Mr. Smith has great</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>vision. He builds a Web site that appeals to both local and global interests. Here’s</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>how…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>His well-written concrete-related articles provide a valuable information resource</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>for all visitors, regardless of their geographic location.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) Local visitors </B>(who are not currently clients) come to trust Mr. Smith as he</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>demonstrates over and over again through his articles, and his e-zine, two very</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>appealing attributes - his unwavering commitment to the "putting-the-needs-of-the-customer-</FONT><FONT size=3>first” philosophy and the breadth of his knowledge pertaining to all things</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Before long, Mr. Smith becomes established in his visitors’ minds as “The Concrete</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Man.” When these local prospects need a concrete repairman, guess who they’re going</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to call?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Local visitors come to recognize Mr. Smith as more than “some guy with a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete repair service.” Thanks to the bio (About Us) page, they learn he’s a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>dedicated father, an active member of the community, and a little league coach, as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>well as being the owner of a company. This information adds to his credibility.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Global visitors produce a secondary income stream for him. Mr. Smith can refer</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>these surfers to merchant-partners (and their products) that he represents (ex., books</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>about landscape design, a retailer of concrete statues, a garden supplier for</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>concrete molds, trowels, etc.,). And, of course, he could also <B>sell </B>his own e-book,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>consulting services, Google’s AdSense, etc.</FONT> <FONT size=3>Mr. Smith’s warm-and-willing-to-buy visitors trust his knowledgeable advice. His</FONT> <FONT size=3>PREselling efforts make it easier for him to convert these visitors into customers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Bottom line?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>PREsell effectively… to sell effectively. </B>It’s as simple as that! And this means…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The <B>needs of your target group </B>must be your <B>#1 priority</B>, the reason behind every</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>action you take. always comes second.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So keep your visitors in constant focus and…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>PREsell... don’t sell! Use great content to create an “open-to-buy/hire” mindset in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your customer. Warm up your visitors first.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Maximize profit by maximizing your traffic (by delivering lots of topical content) and</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Conversion Rate (CR).</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Your <B>CR </B>depends upon what you do and how you do it. You will achieve higher</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>Conversion Rates </B>if you...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Reach targeted traffic in a reputable fashion (ex., visitors find you via the Search</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Engines).</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Deliver valuable, appropriate editorial content that PREsells.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Recommend visitors to your income-generating source (ex., your sales/order page,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the site of the merchant-partners that you represent, your online store, etc.) <B>after </B>they</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>come to respect and like you.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>OK, let’s build on this extremely important foundation. We introduced the term “<B>Most</B><B>Wanted Response” </B>earlier. Now it’s time to go into more depth about this concept…</FONT>
