<BR><FONT size=3>Got your <B>MWR </B>firmly planted in your brain?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Fantastic! Have you also made notes from your assignment about those six key</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>components - <B>MWR</B>, Opening Headline, Opening Paragraph, Sub-headings, links to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the <B>MWR</B>, and Body Copy?</FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3>What do you mean by "The dog ate it”? If you have not yet done so, review the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>example site now <B>(http://auctions.sitesell.com/). </B>You'll learn a lot more, if you do the</FONT> <FONT size=3>exercise. Or if you cannot identify with auctions, go to <B>http://find.sitesell.com/. </B>Find </FONT><FONT size=3>your type of business there and click to <B>that </B>site and review its sales copy.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Read it with the following in mind... How are these <B>words </B>affecting me? What are these</FONT> <FONT size=3>words trying to do? See how the copy is trying to get into the targeted customer's </FONT><FONT size=3><B>mindset</B>.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Okay, we're ready to work on the foundation for a successful e-biz…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Surprised? Are you thinking to yourself?...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>”Where's the keyboard action?”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>”What about formatting?”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>”No headline creation?”…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Well, just like most things in life, you can't skip to the front of the line, without some</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>unpleasant consequences. Effective <B>PREselling </B>and <B>selling </B>are no different. Every</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>word-headline-sentence-paragraph has a persuasive role to play… a powerfully</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>persuasive role.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A firm foundation is critical for whatever actions you take from now on. So let's go back</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to ground level. Your business, whether it is...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>big or small,</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>pioneer or mature,</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>high-tech or labor-intensive,</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>top-end or bargain-basement,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>... depends on the perceived value of your product (or service) by your customers.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>If they do not see a benefit or "what's in it for them," then their relationship with you will</FONT> <FONT size=3>go no further. Your prospective customers will look elsewhere. And your competitors</FONT> <FONT size=3>are always willing and waiting to greet them.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>How do you prevent this?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Know your target or ideal customer first... put yourself in her shoes and get</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>inside her head</B>…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>She represents the majority of people who would be specifically interested in your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>product or service. No tire-kickers… no curious cruisers… just prospects with a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>specific interest in your specific business. You have to understand her thoughts and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>feelings, figure out her personality type, sense what makes her tick.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Basically, you have to get inside her head. Once you know your customer, you can</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>anticipate her wants, appeal to the right emotions and show her how your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>product/service will benefit her. We both know what happens then. Value always</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>outweighs financial cost in a shopper's mind.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You PREsell by providing valuable content! Then, and only then, you sell by providing</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>valuable <B>benefits. </B>A satisfied customer becomes a lifetime customer, as long you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>“overdeliver” on everything you say and do.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>On the Net, you don't have the luxury of face-to-face contact or a slow pace to get to</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>know your customers. That's why it's critical to develop a thumbnail sketch of your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>target or <B>ideal </B>customer before you begin to write any copy on your Web site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Remember your words are like a virtual salesperson, behind the counter or stationed in</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the aisle.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your sales copy has to make your <B>ideal customer </B>feel that you are talking to her,</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>one-on-one, welcoming her, providing attentive service and fulfilling her wants. You</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>cannot write effectively unless you know her mindset.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Oh, by the way... when we talk about a customer, as you may have noticed, we use</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the feminine pronouns (she, her). Why? Two reasons…</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>To jar your thinking - we are all so used to reading "he" and "his." Reading the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>female pronouns will remind you to think that people, males and females, will be reading</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your words.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>To drive home the fact that women account for up to 80% of purchases on the Net</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>(depending on your niche, of course). "Normal" use of the male pronouns would keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you "thinking male."</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A thumbnail sketch of your ideal customer, paints a picture in your mind of whom you</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>are dealing with... and more importantly, to whom you are writing. Success will not</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>come if you write for yourself. You don't need to be persuaded. <B>You </B>already know and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>love your product/service (or those that you represent). Write for your target</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>customer…her needs, wants, worries, interests.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Boil your target down to a single, ideal customer. Picture her. Now write for her.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Thinking of a single person automatically helps your copy feel "one-to-one" as you write.</FONT> <FONT size=3>If you think of thousands of people as you write, your copy will take on an impersonal,</FONT> <FONT size=3>broadcast" tone. You know her best so talk to her!</FONT>
