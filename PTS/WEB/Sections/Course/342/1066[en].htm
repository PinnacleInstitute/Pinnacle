<BR><B><FONT size=4>Not Features!</FONT></B> 
<BR>&nbsp; 
<BR><FONT color=#0033ff>Words are the most powerful drug used by mankind.</FONT> 
<BR>- Rudyard Kipling 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Great copy grabs a reader's attention and holds it by intensifying her interest in what is</FONT> <FONT size=3>being presented. It <B>d-r-a-w-s </B>the reader down the page and lands her “open-to-buy”</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>right at your order form (or your income-generation source). As long as the information</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>is realistic, relevant and answers the question, "What's in it for me?", the reader will</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>continue to scroll… for as long as it takes.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Slip even once, though, and the mouse finger clicks. Your words alone increase the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>perceived value of your product or service. And it’s your words that persuade your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>reader to become a customer.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>What you write has to reflect your knowledge and passion about what you are <B>selling</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>or representing</B>. Insincerity, unsureness, and a lack of enthusiasm will easily be</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>detected "between-the-lines." Hype is in a (sub)class of its own... fatal.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So become the expert on your product or service. Build a sense of trust and credibility</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>in your visitors so that they won’t put up a hurdle between you and their credit card.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>"Isn't that obvious?"</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Yes and no...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>You know your product from <B>your </B>perspective, for sure. But you must know it inside</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and out, from every possible angle...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Ask for opinions from other people. Do they see it the same way? Have they</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>discovered a new dimension?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Compare your product with your competition. How does it measure up?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Look at what's happening in the marketplace. Where is its position?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Be a real sleuth. Uncover as much detail as you can - positive and negative.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>And then... you guessed it! Get out that pencil and paper again (or your keyboard and</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>word processor will do!).</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Write down all the features (i.e., what your product does or is) of your product or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>service. This will be a very long and objective list if you spread your sleuthing net far</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>enough. Finished? No feature left unexamined?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Great job!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Now bring out that thumbnail sketch of your customer and put it beside your just</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>completed “features” list. Imagine that your ideal customer is examining those</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>features. Will she be persuaded by what she sees? Will the features immediately</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>trigger a "must-have" reaction?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Sadly, the answer is <B>no</B>… at least not for the majority of customers. And why not?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Because most folks don't have the imagination to immediately see "what's in it for them"</FONT> <FONT size=3>just by seeing features. People buy with their emotions, not with their logic. So you</FONT> <FONT size=3>have to transform that list of features into a list of benefits.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Only benefits tap emotions.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>Only benefits answer the critical question... "What's in it for me?"</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So make the change. Do the transformation. Take that thumbnail sketch and <B>become</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>the customer. Work through the features and figure out how each one benefits you, the</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>customer. Don't rush. Really become your customer. Get the mindset right.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here are some examples to get you started...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Does a certain feature save time, especially if someone is presently over-extended at</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>work?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>That's a benefit.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Does a key feature encourage a child to read, just for the fun of it?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>That's a benefit.</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>Does another feature provide independence, a chance to make decisions for oneself?</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>That's a benefit.</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Starting to get the hang of it? Want to see some “live” benefit-focused content? Check</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>out one of the following sites (or all three if you are keen)…</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Benefits for information publishers… <B>http://infopublishing.sitesell.com/</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Benefits for network marketers... <B>http://networkmarketing.sitesell.com/</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Benefits for local business owners with local clients… <B>http://localbiz.sitesell.com/</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Same product. Different benefits. All the time.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In summary...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Features are elements of a product (or service) that <B>do, </B>or that <B>are</B>. Benefits are the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>results that <B>do for your customer. </B>They connect at an emotional level by delivering a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>gain or curing a pain. Let your benefits list grow and grow. You can never have too</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>many.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>All benefits add to the perceived value of your product or service, the higher the</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>perceived value, the greater the chance you have for a sale... or a download... or a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>subscription… or contract, depending on your <B>Most Wanted Response. </B>Always keep</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>this foremost in your mind.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Confusing features and benefits is <B>the </B>#1 copywriting problem. That’s where <B>MYWS!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>comes to your rescue. It will help you develop a huge list of the <B>most relevant </B>benefits</FONT> <FONT size=3>quickly and easily through its “<B>SWAT?” </B>technique. You just keep swatting those</FONT> <FONT size=3>features until they are rock-solid, irresistible benefits. The <B>SWAT? </B>technique is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>indispensable for all small business owners, online or off, experienced copywriters or</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>not. Why?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Because benefits will always be the bottom line that <B>sells!</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>A long benefits list provides the key information you need to write persuasive copy on</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>your Web site. Benefit-laden <B>words </B>strike visitors "where they live." They fulfill wants</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>and provide solutions for your ideal customer. They guarantee that you will keep her</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>attention and increase her interest. And that puts you well on your way to a sale!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>So what's the key to using the Web to multiply sales or contracts?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Provide high-value, benefit-oriented copy, not a straight "sales pitch." This type of copy</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>builds motivated traffic and develops a sense of warmth and confidence in you as</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>someone who “knows” their pains or dreams.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>People buy from folks they like and trust. It's as simple as that. Targeted PREsold</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>visitors will click through to your order page (or other revenue locations). The sale is</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>99.9% of the way home!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>The benefits list has a second function and this function is really just an extension of the</FONT> <FONT size=3>first. It will help you create your <B>Unique Selling Proposition (USP).</B></FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your <B>USP </B>tells your reader what differentiates you and your product/service from your</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>competitor. It is your single best benefit that every visitor to your Web site will perceive</FONT> <FONT size=3>as being unique to you. It tells your visitor why they should buy from you and not the</FONT> <FONT size=3>business on the next site.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Your <B>USP </B>is your service or product’s <B>most powerful benefit, </B>in combination with a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>strong, unique feature of your business. It answers that critical question... Why</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>should potential customers buy from or hire you?</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Here’s a simple exercise to help you develop your <B>USP...</B></FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>1) </B>Write down what your business provides.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>2) </B>Outline the key benefit(s) to your client. What pain does it cure, what solution does it</FONT> <FONT size=3>provide? Just the most important benefits(s), please.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>3) </B>Identify your unique feature. What makes you stand out from the competition? Keep</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>working on this until you can clearly separate yourself from the field. There must be a</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>convincing reason for doing business with you, instead of your competitor. If not, create</FONT> <FONT size=3>a unique positioning statement.</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>4) </B>Summarize all of the above into one tight, powerful, motivating phrase that</FONT> <FONT size=3>will <B>persuade </B>your client to do business with you, to trade their money for the benefits</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>you can deliver. As you start to work through these four steps, you may find this to be a</FONT> <FONT size=3>lot harder than it looks. It is! But don’t give up! Your competition is only a click away.</FONT> <FONT size=3>Use your <B>USP </B>to differentiate yourself!</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>As the Net expands, a compelling <B>VPP </B>will be essential. Your business has to be able</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>to stand out from the crowd.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Ready for a homework assignment?...</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Go back to your benefits list. Start by narrowing down your choices, one by one.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Whittle them down until you are satisfied that you have identified the very best benefit.</FONT> <FONT size=3>Not sure? Ask for a second or third opinion.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Then package this benefit into...</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>a sentence or phrase that persuades</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>a collection of words that highlights an outstanding benefit that a visitor/ reader can't</FONT> <FONT size=3>ignore</FONT> 
<BR><B><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></B> 
<BR><FONT size=3><B>• </B>a message that makes her think "Your product/service is the only one for me."</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>Building the perfect <B>USP </B>will be the hardest thing that you'll ever have to do. And it will</FONT> <FONT size=3>be one of the most important. (Yet another reason why the <B>SWAT? </B>technique is an</FONT>
<BR><FONT size=3>indispensable tool in your Netwriting toolbox, <B>available in Make Your Words Sell!... </B>it</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>does more than help you identify the maximum number of benefits. It will help you build</FONT> <FONT size=3>the best possible <B>USP</B>.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>When you are working on this assignment, the key is to keep your customer's mindset</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>up front and center at all times.</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>&nbsp;</FONT> 
<BR><FONT size=3>In the next Chapter, we'll see why it's worth some extra "cyber elbow grease" to get your <B>USP </B>exactly <B>right</B>... the absolutely best it can be…</FONT>
