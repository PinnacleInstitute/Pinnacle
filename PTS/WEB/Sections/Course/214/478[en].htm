<P><FONT size=3>The three step process in the career planning requires that you first make an informed career decision.&nbsp; Career decision making is a dynamic and ongoing process where your knowledge of self, your values, interests, temperament, financial needs, physical work requirements or limitations, etc., the effects of past experiences, new information, and changes in your life situation and environment all intertwine. It requires constant review of decisions already made and consideration of decisions yet to be made. Good decision making requires you to engage in a process that requires you to: </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Once you have made a career decision and a choice of an occupation, then develop an Action Plan. An action plan begins with the identification of short-term and long-term goals. Before you set short-term and long-term career goals, you should have taken informal or formal assessments. Using the results from these assessments, as well as labor market information, identify careers that will match your abilities, interests, values, personality, development stage, financial needs, transportation and family needs. An effective career plan broadens your horizons and make the achievement of your dreams far more likely. An effective career plan requires you to set both long-term and short-term goals and they are equally important. Long-term goals give you a more clear idea of the things to accomplish in the long run as they are usually big and central to your life. The steps taken to reach long-term goals are short-term goals. Short term goals are achievable within a relatively short period of time (six months to a year). Short-term goals may also be accomplished daily or attained within a month. </FONT>

<P align=center><FONT size=3>5. <B>Desirable </B>-  wanted </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Plan both short term and long term goals. For example, your short term goal may be taking a minimum wage job while simultaneously pursuing post secondary education in preparation for a career, or your short-term goal might be taking several part-time jobs until you find a stable full-time job. A long term goal takes much more time to reach. For example, if your long-term goal is to become a doctor, then you need to set aside eight years out of your life to pursue a medical career. Identify your goal, then list steps that you enable you to reach the goal. Intermediate steps should be listed on a minuscule basis. In as fine a detail as possible, list every step necessary for you to take to reach your goal. Include in the steps, any necessary course work, training and preparation that might be required in order to enter the occupation. Goals are more effective when they are periodically evaluated to determine if they are realistic and attainable and modified whenever necessary. </FONT>
