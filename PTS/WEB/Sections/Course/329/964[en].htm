<FONT face="Times New Roman">With so many options and people to choose from, choosing a dog trainer to help you with your dog can be a daunting task. There are no licenses or requirements necessary for somebody to claim themselves as a dog trainer. Anybody can hang a shingle and pass out a card and they are instantly a professional dog trainer. This complicates things when trying to find the right person to train with. Below are some tips to help you in your search.</FONT>

If you’re dealing with a specific issue, find someone who has experience dealing with your specific issue. Determine if you’re interested in group classes, board and train packages, or private lessons and then contact a variety of trainers that offer what you’re looking for. </FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Locate trainers:</B> there are several places you can look. The International Association of Canine Professionals (<A href="http://www.dogpro.org/">www.dogpro.org</A>) has a list of trainers in their organization. Ask local veterinarians, groomers, boarding facilities, and even friends with well behaved dogs who they have worked with. Look in the yellow pages and/or the internet. Again remember though that anybody can claim they are a trainer.</FONT>

Find out how long they have been training dogs for, what methods they use, what programs they offer, and if they have any specialties. Find out if they are a full time trainer or a hobbyist (both can train just as well depending on the person). Ask for referrals from dogs they’ve trained and if they offer group classes, ask if you are welcome to observe a class. (DO NOT hire a trainer that will not let you see their work before they start working with your dog. Be aware however that many group class trainers have a specific class they would allow you to see…personally I don’t allow people to come to my orientation because I teach problem solving in my orientation and I would solve all the problems for a potential client in that one session, thereby eliminating potential clients) Ask if they offer any guarantees. NOBODY should offer a guarantee that your dog will be trained in a specific amount of time etc. Training time is based on the personality of the dog and owner, how much time the owner is willing to put into the training, methods used etc. The only guarantee that should be offered is how much the trainer is willing to help. Ask if they have experience working with your particular breed or problem. Find out if they are a member of any training organizations (the APDT, IACP and NADOI are specific trainer organizations.) Be aware that “certifications” are offered by various groups. If a trainer claims they are “certified” find out by whom and what the “test” was like. Written tests are fine but they don’t necessarily test “hands on” experience working with a dog. Most “certification tests” are biased and reflect the likes and dislikes of the certifying body. Ask what equipment an individual has experience using. Most longtime trainers have experience using a wide variety of equipment. They should be well rounded enough to know that different dogs require different types of equipment and different types of training. Beware the trainer that is so SET on one particular method that they can’t see the forest for the trees. </FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Determine if the trainers approach coincides with what you are looking for:</B> If you have your heart set on a specific style of training (clicker, remote collar, etc) let the trainer know. A good trainer should be able to tell you the pros and cons of each individual style and help you to make a decision that is most appropriate for you and your dog. When observing a class or speaking with referrals, ask if the trainer was friendly and instructed in such a way that their instructions were easy to understand. Make sure that when narrowing your choice of trainers down that you can get along with the trainer of your choice. </FONT>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">You get what you pay for:</B> Training isn’t expensive, it’s priceless. Realize that you are paying for the time and expertise of a professional. A trainer should not try to “sell” you themselves based on the fact that they’re cheaper then the competition. Good trainers know what they are worth and will charge accordingly. If you try to find a trainer based solely on how much they charge, you may be VERY disappointed with the results. </FONT>

These statements may sound good to the novice ear but you may be very surprised by the results of such “politically correct” thinking. Although it is possible to train a dog with “purely positive” or “positive reinforcement” styles of training, the results are not always 100% reliable and it could take months or years to accomplish the same results a well timed and fair “correction” could solve in a matter of minutes. With many trainers this is a ploy to entice you into purchasing more and more lessons (because it takes longer to train this way). If a trainer states that they use “operant conditioning” methods, ask them what the 4 quadrants of operant conditioning are and if they are balanced enough to use ALL 4 quadrants.(The four quadrants are: Positive Reinforcement, Negative Reinforcement, Positive Punishment, and Negative Punishment.&nbsp;Also beware the trainer that refuses to use ANY positive reinforcement. Old school trainers may train ONLY with corrections and not use ANY type of motivation. The best trainers will realize that every dog learns differently and will have MANY tools in their toolbox to work with you to get the results you desire. Ask what the prospective trainer uses for a reward and what types of corrections they use. A good trainer will tell you “whatever works for the individual dog and owner to get happy and fast results”. A well timed and fair correction could include a pop on the leash and collar, a squirt bottle, the removal of a reward, etc….beware the trainer that only has enough skill to focus on one type of correction for EVERYTHING. Keep an open mind about styles and ask if the prospective trainer can demonstrate for you. </FONT>

<P><FONT face="Times New Roman"><B style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;</B>Once you have narrowed down your search, keep an open mind and let the trainer do their job. If there is something they are doing that you don’t like, don’t be afraid to say so and ask WHY they’re doing it and what the end results will be. Good trainers will be willing to adapt what they’re doing to the benefit of the dog and the owner; if you don’t tell them this and you just walk away…you’re not allowing them to do this. If you DO decide to move along to a different trainer, ask for their recommendation and THEN start the search all over again. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman">The key to training a dog is consistency. You must be prepared to follow the recommendations and instructions of the trainer to the letter. You must also be prepared to put in the time and energy necessary to train the dog. No self respecting trainer wants to spend months on end with a client that won’t do the work to get the dog trained. After all, THEIR name is on the line as well. Be realistic in what you want. Now that you’ve decided to train the dog and you’ve found the right trainer for you…sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride to the obedient companion you’ve always wanted.</FONT>
