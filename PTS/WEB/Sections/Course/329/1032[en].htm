One of the first things people usually ask me is "what&nbsp;equipment should I use to train my dog?". That's a good question&nbsp;since there are&nbsp; many different&nbsp;tools available and many different temperments of both dogs and owners. This section will cover the pros and cons of each collar as well as some basic tips for use. We will also cover other tools needed for training your dog&nbsp;during this course. 
<P>&nbsp;When teaching a dog, we first want to&nbsp;find a way to reward&nbsp;the dog&nbsp;for performing the exercise correctly, and THEN help the dog make the correct choice using our equipment humanely. We will be using food to help a dog begin to learn some of the basic behaviors taught. We can also use toys, access to things the dog wants, petting, etc to reward the dog for a job well done. You are in charge of finding the tool that makes your dog happy. We want his tail to wag in anticipation for whatever you choose. I personally use food to start off with because it's a GENERAL rule that most dogs like food. Treats need to be soft and easily swallowed to prevent too much time wasted on chewing. <B>food:</B> I prefer Natural Balance roll cut into strips that I can break apart easily, rollover, fat free turkey dogs, cheese (not TOO much), pupperoni sticks, etc. You want whatever treat you use to be easy to break down into small pieces (about the size of a pea for a lab size dog). I also like to use Turkey if I'm working with a dog that is hyperactive or easily stressed (it has the added bonus of tryptophan in it).

<P><B>bait bag:</B> Next you will need a "bait bag" of some sort to hold your treats in. I prefer to use a "bait bag"&nbsp;instead of my&nbsp;pocket because it makes my rewards quickly accessible. A fanny pack works well (with the top flap folded back) as does a carpenters apron. You can also purchase "bait bags" from your local pet store. 
<P><B>leash</B> : A good 6 foot leash is imperative. It's important to have 6 feet because we will be using it for teaching distance on the stay and 4 feet is too short. The width of the leash should be in proportion to the size of your dog. A 1" leash would be WAY too big for a chihuahua. If you own a large dog, consider purchasing a nice leather leash. Leather lets you have more "give" in a leash correction and also won't burn your hands the way nylon or cotton will. I prefer leather leashes that are braided at all connection points (as opposed to stitched). This helps the leash&nbsp;&nbsp;last much longer.

<P><B>long line:</B> You are also going to need a 20-30 foot long line. Cotton or nylon webbing with the size and width being in proportion to your dog. Many of my students like to use rope tied to a snap. If you have nothing else, this is acceptable however be forewarned you will probably get a few rope burns along the way. Also, retractable leashes are NOT acceptable for use as a long line.

<P><B>Training collar:</B> This is the hardest part of this lesson to help you with. There are MANY types of training collars available. Determining which type of collar is appropriate depends entirely on the dog and the skill of the handler. This is impossible to do online. Please be aware that ALL collars can be abused. Used incorrectly many collars can hurt a dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrong collar on a dog can be an ineffective training tool as well. In this section we will go over each of the types of training collars and their pro's and con's. We will also cover some appropriate uses for each of the types of collars. 
<P>&nbsp;<U>Chain training collar:</U> This is more commonly referred to as a "choke" chain. Placed on the dog with the dog sitting next to your left side...the collar should resemble an upside down letter "P". When the slack is pulled taut, there should be NO MORE THEN 2 INCHES OF SLACK! This is very important if this is the collar you will decide to use. Many people don't use this collar correctly. They let the dog drag them around with it thinking the chocking action will stop the dogs pulling. This is incorrect and could harm the dogs trachea by applying constant pressure to the lower side of the neck. Used appropriately there should be a sharp tug on the collar (the amount of pressure you apply depends on the breed, size, and temperment of the dog). In the beginning phases you will not use too many corrections so on ocassion MAY use steady and light pressure on the collar to "guide" the dog into position. Pros: the sound the collar makes can soon be enough of a correction, it can be used with a variety of dogs. Cons: the propensity for trachea damage when used incorrectly. Some dogs are not phased enough by this collar. 
<P><U><IMG alt="slip chain training collar.jpg" hspace=0 src="http://www.pinnacleti.com/Sections/Courses/329/slip%20chain%20training%20collar.jpg" align=baseline border=0></U> 
<P><U>Pinch or Prong collar:</U> Although this collar LOOKS like an old torture device, rest assured that it can be used appropriately to bring about excellent results in a way the dog understands. As with any collar, this tool can be used inappropriately and can hurt a dog. Its corrections are more easily distributed then the "choke" chains and it cannot close all the way down across the trachea. I have yet to see this collar cause any damage when used correctly(except for when it is left on indefinitely without owner supervision). If you have ever watched two dogs roughhousing with each other, you will notice that they spend alot of time biting on each others necks. Their necks have the muscles and fur to be able to tolerate this. This collar gives you, the owner...TEETH. It enables you to correct the dog in the language he understands.&nbsp;To&nbsp;put this collar on: open one of the interlocking prongs. Place the collar around the neck, and lock the prongs together again. Fit: For&nbsp;tiny toy dogs you can find a&nbsp;"micro prong" collar. For small dogs or for fine tuning on large dogs use the&nbsp;small pinch collar. For Large dogs use a medium pinch collar. In this collar the "width" of the collar is what determines the size. I have never yet used a large pinch collar. They don't have&nbsp;as much of an effect.&nbsp;Once on, the collar should fit snug against the neck (no slack) without digging into the neck. The leash goes on the ring that swivels.&nbsp;Pros: Many dogs respond quickly to the slightest amount of pressure on this collar. It can be used effectively for "fine tuning" any dogs basic obedience. It works wonderfully for large, and rowdy dogs that pull continuously on the leash, or ignore corrections on other collars. Cons: It can be used incorrectly and hurt a dog (swinging the dog around on it, hanging on a dog on it etc). for sensitive dogs it is "too much".&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to unlock the prongs. Also, if one of the links is loose it has a tendency to snap the whole collar off. To prevent this I simply clip the leash on an oversize choke chain in addition to the pinch collar so that if the pinch comes off, I still have the leash attached to a back up collar.&nbsp; This is typically my collar of choice for boistorous or active dogs.

<P><U>Premier collar/Greyhound collar/martingale collar</U>- this collar is sometimes appropriate for very thin skinned breeds and breeds with large necks and narrow heads (like the greyhound or the whippet). It can be used the same way a buckle collar is used except it's harder to slide out of. I don't care for using this dog with overly active dogs because it doesn't seem to settle them down as quickly as say the pinch collar. It is good for overly sensitive dogs however.

<P><U>Headcollar</U>: This collar works on the same concept as a halter works on a horse. The straps come up over the nose and around behind the ears. The concept is: where the nose goes, the body follows. Also it applies pressure over the muzzle, supposedly the same way a mother dog applies pressure over the muzzle of a pup. This is my tool of second choice. First choice for sensitive dogs. Fit: the muzzle strap should only be able to slide to the fleshy part of the nose (it doesn't have to stay there...just needs to be able to reach it) without sliding off. The ear strap should fit like a watch band (very snug). There are several different types of headcollars available. Halti, Gentle Leader, Snoot loop, K9 Come A Long. For purposes of consistency in this course we will use a gentle leader. Pros: it prevents pulling and can be used to teach "quiet" rather quickly. It is used to help with aggressive problems (although if you have an aggressive dog you need to contact a professional in person right away) and can be used for confidence boosting for shy dogs. It also tones down super dominant pups. Cons: many dogs don't like this collar and some NEVER get used to it. It is merely a prevention aid where problems are concerned and once the collar is off, the dog reverts.&nbsp; If you choose the halti brand, be sure to snap the leash to a back up collar as well as this brand seems to slip off more then the others. A correction on this type of collar is steady pressure on the collar until the dog performs the exercise correctly. Also, never just put the collar on and go. It takes time to get the dog used to it...you put it on, give a food treat, play a game, or get the dog distracted from the thing on it's face, then take it off. After a couple of days of that you do the same thing with the leash dragging from the collar. THEN pick up the leash and go with the dog.

<P><U>Electronic collar:</U> This is a VERY controversial tool. This tool should NEVER be used without the help of a qualified professional. As with any collar, used correctly it is great, used incorrectly it can be very disasterous. In the old days the collar was used to "fry" the dog so to speak. Newer versions of the collar simply give a buzzing stimulus and can start at a very LOW level. Some levels (depending on the collar) can barely be felt by humans. On a low level it feels like nothing more then a tens machine like those used for humans in chiropractors. They are not "hot" and can be used for many things. Like I said however, this tool should NEVER EVER be used without the help of a QUALIFIED professional. Used incorrectly it can really really ruin a dog. For further information on this collar and for a list of those trained to use an electronic collar please see: <A href="http://www.sitmeanssit.com">www.sitmeanssit.com</A> 
<P>WARNING: Never leave a training collar on your dog while he/she is unattended. Other then a regular flat buckle collar, you should remove all training collars unless you're working with the dog, or walking him/her. 
<P>&nbsp;There are many other types of training collars available. Please do not use a harnass as a trainer collar unless directed by your veterinarian for medical reasons.
<P><B> The last equipment you need for obedience training your dog is: LOTS OF LOVE AND PATIENCE!</B>
