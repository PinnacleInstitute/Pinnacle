<H2>Inform Your Creditors</H2>
<P>Now that you have worked out a plan, destroy all your credit cards, do not take out any more loans except in extreme emergencies, and contact each creditor and explain your plan. Go visit each creditor. If you cannot visit your creditor, call or write a letter. Do not send the letter unless you intend to follow through with the repayment plan. Remember, creditors would rather receive a small payment than nothing at all. They also prefer to have the money than the items you purchased. 
<P>Explain to each creditor that you do not have the money to pay back the minimum payment that he or she has specified on the monthly statement. Be prepared to provide the following information to each creditor: 
<UL type=disc>
<LI>Why you fell behind in your payments; loss of a job, illness, divorce, death in the family, and/or poor money management skills 
<LI>Your current income 
<LI>Your other obligations 
<LI>How you plan to bring this debt up to date and keep it 
<LI>The exact amount you will be able to pay back each month 
<LI>Always request that all payments go to principal 
</UL>
<P>If you fail to follow the plan that you and your creditors have agreed upon, you will harm your chances of getting future credit. Tell your creditor about any changes that may affect your payment agreement. 
<P>Do not wait for creditors to contact you. Call the creditors before bills are due. They will be much more likely to work with you. 
<P>If you owe a large amount of money and your creditors will not accept reduced payments, then you may have to consider bankruptcy or loan consolidation. <H3>
<BR>Review and Revise Repayment Plan</H3>
<P>When one debt is paid off, put the extra money back into the plan; adjust payments accordingly. Keep in touch with creditors.
