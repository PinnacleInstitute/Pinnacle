<H3>Credit Counseling Services</H3>
<P>Sometimes it does not seem possible to manage the problem of being overextended financially. If you are unable to solve your financial problems alone, counseling services can help you set up a budget and a debt payment plan. Nonprofit financial counseling agencies charge little, if anything, for their services. Military bases and industries often hire people that can help you manage your debts. Housing authorities, credit unions and universities sometimes provide financial counseling.<H3>Work With Creditors</H3>
<P>You may also be able to work with creditors in other ways. Creditors may allow you to refinance a debt. Refinancing lowers monthly payments by extending the length of the debt. In addition, interest already paid on the debt may be lost; consequently the total finance charge increases. Refinancing can also require additional collateral or a co-maker. Another way to work with creditors is to consolidate debts. As with refinancing, the monthly commitment is less because the length of the debt has been extended. One advantage is that there is just one payment.
<P>A danger with both refinancing and consolidation is that the debtor will think there is more to spend, and will take on additional debt defeating the purpose of working with the creditor in the first place.
<P>Whether refinancing or consolidation is available will depend upon the creditor and upon the debtor's history with the creditor as well as how credit has been handled in the past.<H3>Court Provisions</H3>
<P>The Federal Bankruptcy Code provides consumers with two forms of debtor relief. Chapter 7 of the code is the straight bankruptcy provision and provides for liquidation (convert into cash) of the debtor's assets. With Chapter 13 you promise to pay existing debts with part of the income you will earn in the next few years.
