<H2>Find Out Who You Owe</H2>
<P>The first step in getting out of debt is to find out who you owe and how much you owe. So get out all of your credit statements and find the following information: 
<UL>
<LI>Name of creditor 
<LI>Creditor's address 
<LI>Creditor's telephone number 
<LI>Your account number 
<LI>Collateral (property such as your home, car, land, jewelry or other assets that secures any debt) 
<LI>Outstanding balance owed 
<LI>Remaining number of payments 
<LI>Monthly payment 
<LI>Payment due date 
<LI>Amount last paid 
<LI>Date last paid 
<LI>Type of legal action taken (such as garnishment or repossession) 
<LI>Collection agency or attorney 
</UL><H3>Decide How Much You Can Pay Back</H3>
<P>Now you know who you owe. Figure out how much you can pay each creditor, and decide how long it will take to pay back each debt.
<P>Develop a bare-bones budget for living expenses. Find extra income if possible. Cut or eliminate expenses, at least for a short time until debts are paid.
