<P>This net worth statement includes two ratios useful for assessing financial stability: the current or liquidity ratio and the debt load ratio. 
<P>Find the current or liquidity ratio by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Most experts like to see a ratio of at least 1.0 so current liabilities are covered by current assets. Whether that guideline applies to a particular situation depends on the total picture, not just on this one ratio. This figure can, however, help determine how well the household might do in case of short-term income loss due to disability or unemployment, for example. 
<P>Find the debt load ratio by dividing total liabilities by total assets. A debt load figure of less than 1.0 is preferred, but be sure to look at the total financial picture and not just this one ratio to determine if the debt ratio for a particular situation could be higher or should be lower.
