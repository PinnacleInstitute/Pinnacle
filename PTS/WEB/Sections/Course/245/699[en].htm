<H3 align=center><A name=awo>Assets, or What is Owned</A></H3>
<P>Assets are divided into three categories: current assets, fixed assets, and deferred assets. 
<P><B>Current assets</B> are cash or things that could be easily converted into cash, such as cash on hand, a savings account, or a money market account. 
<P><B>Fixed assets</B>, such as a home or car, are those owned items not expected to be sold or converted into cash. 
<P><B>Deferred assets</B> include assets that cannot be converted into cash, either at all, or not without a substantial penalty, until a later time. IRAs and retirement plans are examples of deferred assets. 
<P>To complete the net worth statement, show current cash value figures for all assets. Use actual cash figures for cash on hand, and in checking and savings accounts. Include money owed to you only if you are certain of repayment. Find the current market values of certificates, stocks, bonds, and mutual fund shares by checking the market quotes in a newspaper or by contacting your broker or the issuing agency or institution. 
<P>Put a cash value on fixed assets by getting an accurate estimate of what would be received if the asset was sold today. Some experts suggest the ballpark figure of $10,000 for the personal property of a two-adult household. 
<P>A household inventory (if done with actual and not just replacement figures) may be helpful in estimating the value of possessions; just be sure to estimate conservatively. For special personal property such as jewelry or antiques, an accurate appraisal by a credentialed expert is needed. 
<P>Vehicle valuations can be found in the <A href="http://www.kbb.com/"><I>Kelley Blue Book</I></A> available at the library, automobile dealers, or financial institutions. Also, enlist the help of an expert in estimating the value of your home and other real estate. 
<P>Develop a current value figure for deferred assets by contacting the institution holding them or the employee benefits office of the place employed. Only vested amounts should be considered.
