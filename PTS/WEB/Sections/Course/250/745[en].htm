<P>The following suggestions show you how to establish your own credit identity. Depending on your situation, some recommendations will be more helpful than others. If you have your own income or live in a small community where you are well known, obtaining credit could be relatively easy. 
<UL>
<LI><I>Open and maintain checking and savings accounts in your own name.</I> Be careful not to overdraw the checking account, and if possible, add to savings regularly. While this is not an indication that you can handle credit, it will show prospective lenders your ability to handle your own financial affairs. 
<LI><I>Work at either a part-time or full-time job for a few months before applying for credit.</I> 
<LI><I>Apply for a charge account at a local retail or department store.</I> If you are married and want the account in your name only, do not use your spouse's name and income to obtain the credit. If your income is low, start with a smaller independent store where you have shopped before. Limit the number of places where you first apply. Once credit is received, make payments for any purchases promptly. Do not apply for another credit card until you have established a good payment reputation. 
<LI><I>Request any credit under your legal name.</I> A married woman who uses her social title (e.g., Mrs. John Jones) is likely to find the account listed under her husband's name. If married, you can use one of the following: first named and maiden name; first name and husband's surname; or first name and a combined surname (e.g., Susan Smith, Susan Jones, or Susan Smith-Jones). 
<LI><I>Apply for an installment loan to purchase furniture, a major appliance, or a car.</I> If you do not meet the income requirements, consider asking a relative or friend to cosign the note. You will be responsible for payments, but the cosigner must bear the risk of assuming payments if you default on the loan. 
<LI><I>Apply at your local bank for a small loan.</I> Or, if you are a member of a credit union, apply for a loan there. If you do not have a specific use for the borrowed funds, place them in a savings account, money market fund, or a short term certificate of deposit. Consider the interest you pay as the cost of establishing a credit identify. 
<LI><I>Ask if you qualify for an overdraft privilege on your checking account.</I> Even if you never use it, the fact that were accepted could be viewed favorably later. 
<LI><I>If you are married, apply for joint credit.</I> Since June 1, 1977, any credit accounts opened jointly by a husband and wife must be reported in both names. Accounts opened before that date could still be listed only under the husband's name unless a specific request was sent to the credit company asking that credit history information be listed under both names. 
<LI><I>Ask that a joint account be changed to a separate account under your name.</I>
