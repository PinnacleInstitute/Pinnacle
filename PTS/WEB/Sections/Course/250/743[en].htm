<H3 align=center><A name=qc>Qualifying for Credit</A></H3>
<P>To qualify for credit, you must show potential creditors that you are creditworthy. While companies use various criteria to judge credit qualifications, ability to repay debt and willingness to do so are the primary considerations. While scoring systems vary from one creditor to another, characteristics usually examined include <I>income</I>, which measures ability to repay, and <I>credit history</I>, which indicates willingness to repay. Your credit history is a record of contracted debt such as charge accounts at department stores, installment loans, credit card accounts, and mortgage payments. Lenders believe how debt has been handled in the past is an indication of how credit obligations will be met in the future. While many consumers prefer to operate on a "pay as you go" system, cash transactions do not count towards establishing a credit history. 
<P>Other factors that lenders look for are <I>residence, employment record, current assets,</I> and <I>legal age</I> (in Nebraska, age 19) to obtain credit. Owning versus renting your home, the number of years you have been at your residence, and how long you have been employed at your job are viewed as measures of your stability and count towards your total credit score. <I>Debt outstanding</I> is also considered; for example, a substantial amount of indebtedness could affect your ability to repay a new obligation. 
<P align=justify>Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, credit cannot be denied because of age, sex, marital status, race, color, religion, or national origin. In addition, you cannot be denied credit because you receive public assistance or because you have exercised your rights under federal consumer credit protection laws (e.g., you sued a creditor you believed was violating these laws). The law basically provides that information cannot be required unless it is required of all qualified applicants. However, it does not guarantee that you will receive credit; you still must show that you are creditworthy.
