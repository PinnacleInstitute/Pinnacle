<H3 align=center><A name=ech>Establishing a Credit History</A></H3>
<P>Establishing your creditworthiness takes time. Unfortunately, when credit is needed, it is usually needed right away. To be prepared for situations when you need credit (e.g., financial emergencies), take steps now to build a credit history. Whether male or female, single or married, you need to establish your own credit identity. 
<P>In the past, many married women relied on their husbands' credit ratings. Then, when they became divorced or widowed, credit was difficult to get on their own. Even today women can encounter problems obtaining credit unless preventive action is taken.
