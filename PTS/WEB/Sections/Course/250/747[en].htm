<H3 align=center><A name=pcr>Protecting Your Credit Rating</A></H3>
<P>Many consumers have little knowledge about the information in their credit file or even where the information is located. If you do not know where your credit bureau is located, look under "Credit Reporting Agencies" in your telephone book yellow pages or ask your creditors to which bureaus, if any, they report credit transactions. 
<P>You are entitled to know what is in your credit file. Most credit bureaus will charge you a fee for that information unless you were denied credit in the past thirty days based on your credit report. Before you can have access to your report, you must verify that you are the individual whose name is on the file. Ask the credit reporting agency its procedure for disclosing file information. Most credit bureaus have forms to complete before you can see a summary of the file. This summary can be reviewed with you in person at the bureau, over the telephone with an agency employee, or sent via mail with an explanation of the report. Federal law (the Fair Credit Reporting Act) does not give you the right to handle your file physically -- only that you have the access to the information. 
<P>If you find errors that could affect your credit rating, take the steps described earlier to correct your file. Do not be surprised if some credit transactions or accounts are not listed. Some stores or institutions do not report to the credit bureau, and some report irregularly. If there are accounts that you want included, ask the companies to report that information to the credit bureau. 
<P>There are times when you should contact your credit bureau. Before you move to a new community, check your credit report for correct and updated information. This step could prevent problems when you apple for credit at your new location. 
<P>If you are a female who has recently married <I>and</I> changed your name, you need to inform your creditors and the credit bureau. Request that the credit bureau consolidate your past credit history under your new name so that your records remain intact and not under two separate names. 
<P>If you are a married woman who opened accounts with your husband before June 1, 1977, be sure those accounts are reported under both names. If you previously have not taken this action, do so as soon as possible. Simply write to the creditors and indicate that under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, you want all credit information listed under both names. Include in each letter the account number, the names you want listed (remember to use legal, not social, titles) and your address. If accounts opened during that period are now closed, check your credit bureau file. If the accounts are listed only in your husband's name, ask that they also be listed in your name.
