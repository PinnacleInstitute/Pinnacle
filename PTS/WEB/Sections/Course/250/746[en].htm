<H3 align=center><A name=icd>If Credit is Denied</A></H3>
<P>After applying for credit, you should receive an acceptance or rejection notice within thirty days. When credit is denied, you must be told either the specific reason or that you have the right to ask why you were rejected. If the denial was based on information in a credit report, you are entitled to know which credit reporting agency provided the information. If you ask to see your file within thirty days of the rejection notice, the credit agency cannot charge a fee. A fee can be charged, however, if you request a <I>written</I> summary. 
<P>If the file contains errors, the credit bureau must investigate and correct any misinformation. Any information that cannot be verified must be removed. If you do not agree with the report, you can write a brief statement describing your version of the dispute. This statement then becomes a part of your file. Request that the credit bureau send the corrected report to any creditor who received the original report in the past six months. Then ask the company to reconsider your credit application based on the corrected information. 
<P>What if your file does not contain any negative information and you still are unsure why your application was denied? Do not blame the credit bureau. The bureau itself does not give credit ratings; it merely collects and stores information that is provided to its members for a fee. As mentioned earlier, creditors use different scoring systems for granting credit. 
<P>Your next step is to contact the credit department of the company that turned you down. Tell them you want the specific reason for being denied credit. Do not give up if the response is unsatisfactory. Write again to the company's credit division (carbon copies to the credit division manager and/or president of the company could also be in order). Indicate why you disagree with their findings or describe any contributing factors that led to the situation (e.g., due to cutbacks at work, your income last year was lower than usual). Explain why you are a good credit risk. Sometimes companies will reconsider an application if you give them good reasons to do so. 
<P>If taking these actions does not bring favorable results, apply to a different creditor. Perhaps you will qualify under a different lender's scoring system. Be prepared to be persistent until credit is received. 
<P>If you believe that your rejection was a result of discrimination (that is, someone else in a similar situation but of a different age, race, sex, marital status, etc. would be approved), contact the company and remind them of your rights under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Possible steps after trying to resolve the issue include contacting a federal agency such as the Federal Trade Commission or Federal Reserve Bank in your district, or requesting legal assistance.
