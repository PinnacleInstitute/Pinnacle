<H3 align=center><A name=guc>Guidelines for Using Credit</A></H3>
<P>Achieving a good credit rating can take time, but reestablishing one after abusing credit can take even longer. Therefore, it is imperative that you carefully manage your credit use. As you read the following suggestions for using credit, check your own practices to see if there are adjustments you can make. 
<P><B>Know the cost of your credit transactions -</B>&nbsp;Know not only the annual percentage rate (APR), but the actual dollar cost. Compare rates when you shop for credit. Ask yourself if the convenience or other advantages are worth the added cost. 
<P><B>Maintain a record of all credit card account numbers -</B>&nbsp;With that record, keep each company's address and telephone number in case a card is lost or stolen. 
<P><B>Keep a record of purchases and a running balance due for each credit account<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;Always be aware of the <I>total</I> amount owed and not just the monthly payment. 
<P><B>Make payments on time <I> -</I></B>&nbsp;If circumstances prevent your paying bills promptly, contact the creditors and let them know when and how much you will pay.
<P><B>Limit the number of credit cards you carry -</B>&nbsp;Never leave cards accessible to others. If you have cards that are not used often, keep them in a locked strongbox at home or in a safe deposit box. If you have a large number of credit cards, ask yourself if there are some that you can eliminate. 
<P><B>During a credit card transaction, keep your eyes on the steps involved<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;Be sure that the card only imprints one ticket, check the accuracy of the dollar amount before signing, and check that the card returned is yours. As a precautionary measure, request carbons from the credit receipt and destroy them. These carbons contain all of the information needed for someone else to make charges to your account. 
<P><B>Check monthly statements against your credit card receipts<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;If you find an error, write the company immediately. The Fair Credit Billing Act outlines procedures for creditors <I>and</I> consumers when errors occur. Your bill should describe these procedures. 
<P><B>Never lend your card or give your account number to another party to use<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;In most situations, do not give your account number over the telephone. An exception would be if <I>you initiated the call</I> to a reputable company. Under no circumstances should you give your account number to a person <I>who calls you</I>. The solicitor could plan to use your card for fraudulent purposes. 
<P><B>Read any credit contract carefully before signing it<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;If you are uncertain about any part of the contract, ask for clarification. Do not sign until you are satisfied the contract is accurate. 
<P><B>Never take on more debt than you can afford or use credit to live beyond your income<I>  -</I></B>&nbsp;Be aware that credit obligates future income. Using credit involves a risk that future income and expenses can handle that commitment. 
<P>Before setting aside this NebGuide, take a few minutes to review the points that relate to you. Do you need to establish credit? What are two or three steps you can take to get started? Do you need more information? What adjustments can you make to improve your credit practices? Remember, while there are laws to protect your credit rights, you are the one primarily responsible for your credit status.
