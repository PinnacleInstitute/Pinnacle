<P><FONT size=3>1. Be as specific and clear as possible about what you want, think, and feel. The following statements project this preciseness:</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I want to..."</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I don't want you to..."</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"Would you...?"</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I liked it when you did that."</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I have a different opinion. I think that..."</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I have mixed reactions. I agree with these aspects for these reasons, but I am disturbed about these aspects for these reasons." It can be helpful to explain exactly what you mean and exactly what you don't mean, such as "I don't want to break up over this, but I'd like to talk it through and see if we can prevent it from happening again."</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>2. Be direct. Deliver your message to the person for whom it is intended. If you want to tell Jane something, tell Jane; do not tell everyone except Jane; do not tell a group, of which Jane happens to be a member.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>3. "Own" your message. Acknowledge that your message comes from your frame of reference, your conception of good vs. bad or right vs. wrong, your perceptions. You can acknowledge ownership with personalized ("I") statements such as "I don't agree with you" (as compared to "Your wrong") or "I'd like you to mow the lawn" (as compared to "You really should mow the lawn, you know"). Suggesting that someone is wrong or bad and should change for his or her own benefit when, in fact, it would please you will only foster resentment and resistance rather than understanding and cooperation.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>4. Ask for feedback, "Am I being clear? How do you see this situation? What do you want to do?" Asking for feedback can encourage others to correct any misperceptions you may have as well as help others realize that you are expressing an opinion, feeling, or desire rather than a demand. Encourage others to be clear, direct, and specific in their feedback to you.</FONT><B><H3>Learning to Become More Assertive</H3></B>
<P><FONT size=3>As you learn to become more assertive, remember to use your assertive "skills" selectively. It is not just what you say to someone verbally, but also how you communicate nonverbally, with voice tone, gesture, eye contact, facial expression, and posture that will influence your impact on others. You must remember that it takes time and practice, as well as a willingness to accept yourself as you make mistakes, to reach the goal of acting assertively. As you practice your techniques, it is often helpful to have accepting relationships and supportive environment. People who understand and care about you are your strongest assets.</FONT>
