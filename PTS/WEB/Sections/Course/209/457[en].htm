<B> &nbsp;</B> <H3>Selfishness and Aggressiveness</H3>
<P><FONT size=3>When you behave selfishly, or in a way that violates the rights of others, you are, in fact, acting in a destructive, aggressive manner- rather than in a constructive, assertive manner. There is a very fine line that divides the two manners of action.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><U>Aggressiveness means that you express you rights but at the expense, degradation, or humiliation of another.</U> It involves being so emotionally or physically forceful that the rights of others are not allowed to surface. Aggressiveness usually results in others become angry or vengeful, and as such, it can work against your intentions and cause people to lose respect for you. You may feel self-righteous or superior at a particular time- but after thinking things through, you may feel guilty later.</FONT><B><H3>What Assertiveness Will Not Do</H3></B><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" startspan TAG="XBOT" -->

<P><FONT size=3>Asserting yourself will not necessarily guarantee you happiness or fair treatment by others, nor will it solve all your personal problems or guarantee that others will be assertive and not aggressive. Just because you assert yourself does not mean you will always get what you want; however, lack of assertiveness is most certainly one of the reasons why conflicts occur in relationships.</FONT>
