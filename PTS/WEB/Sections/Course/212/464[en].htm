<H1>Conversational Cheap Shots </H1><BLOCKQUOTE><HR color=#554433><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT color=#001133>
<P><FONT size=3>All of the techniques listed in this document have actually been witnessed, told to us by someone else, or dreamed up. They are described in first person for clarity of motive. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The intent of detailing and naming these insidious tactics is so that the reader may AVOID USING THEM, to quickly recognize if someone else is using them, and for fun. There is much humor in the way people (consciously or unconsciously) conversationally cheat. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>It is hoped that exposing these tactics will help muzzle the growing abuse in our conversational landscape. Give copies to both perpetrators and victims (only NOT for profit use). </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The examples are overblown in an attempt to be both clear and funny. Use your imagination to think of how you (perish the thought) and others have used these techniques in the past. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>They have been grouped by major category, with the best (worst!) saved for last. </FONT>
<P></FONT><FONT size=3>First, we have the </FONT><FONT size=3>Ad Hominem Variants</FONT><FONT size=3> where you attack the person as a way to avoid truth, science, or logic which might otherwise prove you wrong. Next are the </FONT><FONT size=3>Sleight of Mind Fallacies</FONT><FONT size=3>, which act as "mental magic" to make sure the unwanted subject disappears. Then, we move on to </FONT><FONT size=3>Delay Tactics</FONT><FONT size=3>, which are subtle means to buy time when put on the spot. Then, the ever popular </FONT><FONT size=3>Question as Opportunity</FONT><FONT size=3> ploys, where any question can be deftly averted. Finally, we have the </FONT><FONT size=3>General Cheap-Shot Tactics and Irritants</FONT><FONT size=3>, which are basically "below the belt" punches. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
