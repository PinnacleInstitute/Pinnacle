<H2>Delay Tactics</H2><HR color=#554433>
<P><FONT size=3>If, when put on the spot to answer a question or point, you come up blank, then delay tactics can buy time to dream up a response. These tactics are risky, because if you are not able to think of anything clever during the time you buy, you will be pinned even further.</FONT> 
<P><H3>DESCRIBE THE ANSWER: </H3><FONT size=3>Give descriptive attributes of the eventual answer, then pause as if expecting a response, while thinking of a real answer. When this technique is repeated the other person will appear to be begging you to give an answer. </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"I think the answer to your last question will clear up your confusion on this subject. (Long pause) Are you ready?" </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"Excellent question, and I think the answer will startle you." (Pause, look thoughtfully as if a response is due while thinking up an answer.) </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I'm glad you asked. Would you like a long or a short answer?"</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>DESCRIBE THE QUESTION:
<BR></H3><FONT size=3>Same as above, only here the diversionary shift of focus is on the question. </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"This question could only come from the confusion of the ______ mind-set." </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"That is an interesting question coming from you. Interesting, interesting, interesting." (Pause, as if admiring the other person. ) </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"The question asked, is basically _______, ________, _______." (Restate the questions in various ways, pausing for approval between each, while thinking up an answer.) </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>QUESTION THE QUESTION / COMMENT: </H3><FONT size=3>A great lead-in for the technique of WISHFUL THINKING, or a method of delay giving yourself time to think of an answer. </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"Why do you ask that?" / "What makes you ask that?" </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"What drives you to make such a statement?"</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>BRAIN SEIZURE:</H3><FONT size=3>A complex statement that paralyzes the brain. </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"What you inferred is not what you implied." </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"Your problem is that you are thinking in a linear versus configurational framework." </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"I'm not sure if I fail to disagree with that or not."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>WORD SALAD, a.k.a. SESQUIPEDALIANISM: </H3><FONT size=3>This is a recipe for sophisticated babbling. Ingredients include: philosophic sounding words and sentence structure, unintelligible Latin terms, banal folk wisdom, jargon, catch phrases, truisms, etc. Sprinkle lightly with a few words that appear to pertain to the subject. This will sound very impressive without really saying anything and will buy time to think of something meaty to say while your lips are flapping. In some circles such machinations can actually be passed off as an <I> answer</I> --or a point! </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"In view of the federal budget deficit, civil unrest, and international politics, we need to consider that, notwithstanding the mitigating circumstances, this country has got to get back on its feet. Don't you agree?"</FONT> 
<P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>REVERSE THE QUESTION: </H3><FONT size=3>Echo the question back or ask the other person a similar or difficult question. (This can be a valid technique if not used merely as a delay tactic.) </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"What do you think the answer to your question is?" </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>"How 'bout if I ask you a similar question?"</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>START A STORY: </H3><FONT size=3>With a sparkle in your eye, start into a long-winded story which presumes to apply to the subject at hand. Continue until the other person calls your bluff, then act insulted and claim that you are not getting equal time or a fair chance to explain you case. Then, thoroughly offended, drop the cover story and start with the real answer (whatever it was you were able to think of while you were babbling). </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>"This reminds me of the time I was in Cucamonga. Let me tell you, it was hot! (Time to think up real answer during dramatic pauses) And we were in a small hotel when a gas leak started. Well! You can imagine how we...."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>OBVIOUS ANSWER: </H3><FONT size=3>To give an obvious, over-literal, useless, or pun response to delay with humor. </FONT>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3>["What is your first point?"] "My first point is point #1." </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>[How do you explain the difference between salaries of men and women in this company who are perfoming the exact same jobs?] "I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with gender."</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
