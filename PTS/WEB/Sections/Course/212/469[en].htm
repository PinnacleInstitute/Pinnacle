<H2>General Cheap Shot Tactics and Irritants</H2><HR color=#554433>
<P><H3>HYPOTHETICAL INSULT:</H3><BLOCKQUOTE>"Take this example: suppose you were a person who was incredibly stupid but was trying to come off as intelligent. What would the proper response be if you were me?" 
<P>"Let's just say that we knew for sure that you were a sexual pervert...." </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>COMPLIMENTARY INSULT: </H3><BLOCKQUOTE>"Why, that is a brilliant question coming from you!" 
<P>"You're looking less repulsive than usual today." 
<P>"Who would have thought you had it in you?" 
<P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>DISTORTED ACTIVE LISTENING: </H3>Active listening is where you parrot back what the other person is saying in order to draw them out and to keep them talking. DISTORTED ACTIVE LISTENING parrots back what the other person is saying, but gets it all wrong or makes it sound incredibly stupid. Similar to LUNATIC FRINGE. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"If I hear you correctly, your point is... (get it all wrong)." 
<P>"It sounds as if you are saying that torturing children is a good idea...." </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>NAME IT: </H3>To the feebleminded, if there is a NAME used as a <I> label </I> for IT, then it <I> must </I> be wrong, even if it isn't. The NAME, now a "proof" of sorts, can be used as a sledgehammer if IT comes up again. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"The case you just made was first made by Edgar Sullivan in the late 1800s and was quickly disproved. The 'Sullivan Error' inevitably occurs to people when they first start studying the subject." 
<P>"Your line of reasoning is called the MacGregor Phenomenon." 
<P>"Why, that's Calvinism!"</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>I KNOW BETTER: </H3>A clever and socially acceptable way of denying what someone has said by claiming to know more about what the other person thinks or feels than they do. Believe it or not, this technique is quite commonplace and effective. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"That's a cruel thing to say, and I know you don't mean it." 
<P>"You've made that point well, but ... (1) I know where your heart is; (2) I sense that you're not comfortable with what you're saying; (3) I know what kind of person you are deep down ... and that you cannot continue to hold this position and maintain your integrity." 
<P>"Johnny, the reason I can't give you permission to go to the party is because I know that deep in your heart you'd rather spend the time here with me." </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>SELECTIVE MEMORY: </H3>To bring up a past event and GET IT ALL WRONG, or even to make up a past event. The intent is to get the other person confused, angry, and defensive. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"You never admit defeat. Remember that chess game I beat you in?" (The one you lost.) 
<P>"But last week (or a minute ago) you said the opposite! Make up your mind!" 
<P>"Remember last time we had an argument, and you turned out to be wrong and wouldn't admit it? Now we're in the same spot we were last time."</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>STUDIES HAVE SHOWN: </H3>When all else is lost, refer to a phony study that supports your case. This is a bet that the other person will not call your bluff. Does he/she know for certain the study didn't happen? The usual response is "I have not seen or heard of this study", further discrediting the other person as not doing comprehensive study of available source material. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"Research at UCLA has proven conclusively...." 
<P>"I know the idea sounds unorthodox, but a recent study at Harvard has substantiated this view." </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>REPEAT OFFENDER, a.k.a. SLOGAN RESPONSES: </H3>The repeated use of an assertion, truism, bad joke, or even physical gesture when used to the point of extreme irritation. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"The customer comes first!" ["But what about our profit?"] "The customer comes first! ["But they don't have any money!"] "The customer... (etc.)." 
<P>["What do you think?"] "It's crazy." (wave arms while stating) ["What is that supposed to mean?"] (wave arms wildly) ["Huh?"] (repeat as necessary) </BLOCKQUOTE><H3>KNEE JERK: </H3><BLOCKQUOTE>"I would like to answer your question directly, but considering your past reactions / ability to cope with the truth / emotional instability, I feel that to do so would be a disservice to you at this time." [Other person gets (justifiably) upset.] "See, what did I tell you. You are flying off the handle already!"</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>LOOK AT YOU: </H3>After using any of the previous ploys, point out any physical manifestations of the other person's irritation as further proof that they are wrong. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"You seem to be sweating a lot. Of course, I would be too if I had to try to support your flimsy position." 
<P>"Why look, your lips are quivering. You have a hard time admitting defeat, don't you?"</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>SELECTIVE QUOTATION: </H3>Use an actual, fabricated, or hypothetical statement from some universally credible source. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"What would your father say if he could hear you now?" 
<P>"As it says in the Bible: 'God helps those who help themselves'." 
<P>"If Albert Einstein were here I think he would agree with me. Didn't he once say 'If an idea does not at first seem absurd, it is probably incorrect'?"</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>FAST ANSWER: </H3>The technique here is to answer so quickly or in such detail that no one could ever doubt the response. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>["Do you really think that anyone else agrees with this crazy idea?"] "52.359% of Americans surveyed agreed."</BLOCKQUOTE><H3>YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT: </H3>If proven wrong or corrected in any way that you do not like, <I> revenge</I>  is the answer here. This can be accomplished by throwing a fit, glowering at the person with a <I> death stare</I> , complete withdrawal or pregnant silence, or some other form of dramatic emotional blackmail as manipulation. The idea is to <I> train</I>  people not to correct you in the future by making them pay dearly for correcting you now. Also known as the THAT WILL TEACH YOU technique and/or THE ESCALATION PLOY. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"If you're going to be that way about it, then...." 
<P>"You don't love me (sob!)." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><H3>PRETEND AD HOMINEM:</H3>A specific escalation of YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT; make it seem as if the other person is attacking <I> you</I>  rather than making a simple point or correction, especially if you suspect that the other party is correct. Rather than staying on the subject, begin to act hurt--as if you have been viciously attacked as a human being--rather than admit you are wrong, or could do better, etc. <BLOCKQUOTE>"I can't do anything right..." 
<P>"I suppose in your eyes I am just a total failure." 
<P>["I think the reason people are honking and gesticulating at you is that the sign says MERGE, not STOP."] "Well, if you think me such a terrible, horrible person...." 
<P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>LISTEN UP: </H3>Pretend that the reason the other person isn't able to agree with you is that they are not listening, or at least not hard enough. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"If you'd just listen you'd have heard me the first time when I said that...." 
<P>"Since you obviously weren't listening when I said this before, I'm forced to repeat myself." 
<P></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>FILIBUSTER: </H3>To take an extraordinary amount of time or go to great technical depth to wear out the other person and get time on your side. The other person is pushed to give up and agree with you rather than endure the torture of hearing you go through another sincere, long-winded answer. 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>"Since you are a true intellectual, I will have to give you a more comprehensive answer than most... Blah, Blah, Blah... (use WORD SALAD technique). 
<P>"Now that I have answered your point, do you have any other concerns?" (Repeat until the other person collapses or gives in.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
