<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">The introductory remarks by which a speaker is presented to his/her audience are an important aspect of public speaking. Listeners will be a more perceptive and appreciative audience if they understand what the speaker is undertaking. One function of the introduction is to establish the proper "mental set" so the group will know what to look for.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">A good introduction contributes to the speaker's authority by making it clear that he or she speaks from special preparation, knowledge or experience.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT color=#000080>What Should the Introducer Say?</FONT></FONT></B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">Speeches of introduction should not be flat or stereotyped. They should be graceful, witty and fun... fun to hear and fun to give. Here is a set of guidelines that will serve as a handy system in organizing the facts that have been collected about the speaker. It is the T-I-S formula, as presented by Dale Carnegie in his book, EFFECTIVE SPEAKING.</FONT></FONT>
<OL>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">T stands for TOPIC. Start you introduction by giving the exact title of the speakers talk.</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">I stands for IMPORTANCE. In this step you bridge over the area between the topic and the particular interest of the group.</FONT> 
<BR>&nbsp; </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">S stands for SPEAKER. Here you list the speaker's outstanding qualifications, particularly those that related to his/her topic. Finally, you give the speaker's name distinctly and clearly.</FONT></FONT>
</OL><FONT size=3><FONT face="verdana, arial, helvetica">From this point you can use your imagination. Tying the formula to the information that you have gathered, take no more than 30-45 seconds to introduce the speaker. Make it short, and make it count.</FONT></FONT>
