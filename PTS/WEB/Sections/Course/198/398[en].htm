<P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The Declaration of Independence, issued on July 4, 1776, stated "We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal..." Yet the new nation declaring its independence permitted the continuation of the practice of slavery for people of African heritage - a practice that continued until the Civil War in the 1860s. At the conclusion of the Civil War, much remained to be done to ensure the rights and privileges of citizenship to all Americans. As America became a more diverse nation, welcoming immigrants from around the globe, problems of racial discrimination endured for many minority group members. Women and persons with disabilities also fought for and obtained laws that provided for fairness and equality. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000 size=2>The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is responsible for enforcing the civil rights laws passed by the Congress. These pages describe the federal civil rights laws and give examples from history that led to their passage.</FONT></FONT><H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Background and Introduction <IMG height=140 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/lincn102.jpg" width=131 align=bottom></FONT></H2>On January 1, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation which freed the slaves held in the states still fighting in the Civil War. After the War, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1865, abolished slavery everywhere in the United States. The Fourteenth Amendment, adopted in 1868, made the former slaves, and any other person born in the United States or naturalized, a citizen and required that all citizens be granted equal protection of the law. The Fifteenth Amendment, adopted in 1879, made it against the law to deny any citizen the right to vote because of his or her race or color or because he or she was formerly a slave. 
<P>Despite the promises of these new laws, the former slaves and their descendants, along with other racial and ethnic minorities, did not receive equal treatment under the law. In fact, in 1896, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that State governments could separate people of different races as long as the separate facilities were equal. This "separate but equal" doctrine lasted until 1954 when the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision in cases involving schools in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. Also in the 1890s, African-Americans were kept from exercising their right to vote by taxes, called "poll taxes", that had to be paid before a person could cast a vote and by tests given by voting registrars who had the power to pass or fail an applicant based on the color of his or her skin. Poll taxes and voting tests were finally outlawed by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
<P>On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress in Montgomery, Alabama, refused to give up her seat on a public bus to a white man who had boarded the bus after she did. At that time, public buses in the South were segregated, and African-Americans not only had to ride in the back of the bus, but also had to give up their seats to any white person who wanted to sit. Ms. Parks was arrested and taken to jail for refusing to give up her seat. On December 5, 1955, African-Americans in Montgomery began a boycott of the public buses led by a minister who had recently come to the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The peaceful boycott continued for 381 days during which time 90% of the African-Americans in Montgomery refused to ride the buses. At the end, the buses in Montgomery were desegregated. <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>The Establishment of the Civil Rights Division</FONT></H2>
<P>In 1957, Congress enacted the first civil rights law since the period following the Civil War. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 created the authority for establishing a civil rights office at the Department of Justice. On December 9, 1957, Attorney General Herbert Brownell issued the order establishing the Civil Rights Division, headed by an Assistant Attorney General, to enforce all Federal statutes affecting civil rights, to investigate complaints of civil rights violations, to coordinate the enforcement of civil rights throughout the Department of Justice, and to consult with and assist other federal agencies in civil rights enforcement. 
<P>In 1957, Congress passed federal civil rights laws providing for some voting rights enforcement and <A href="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/crm.htm">criminal civil rights violations</A> prohibited by laws passed in the 1870s. The Division was very small- fewer than 10 lawyers. This handful of lawyers immediately began to investigate voting rights violations in the South. 
<P>As time went on, more civil rights acts were passed expanding the rights that the Division's lawyers would enforce. In 2002, the Division has more than 350 lawyers dedicated to the enforcement of civil rights laws. <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Criminal Civil Rights Enforcement</FONT></H2>
<P>Federal criminal civil rights laws prohibit certain hate crimes based on race, color or national origin, prohibit police brutality, prohibit church burnings, violence against health care providers, and the transport of persons, particularly women and children, for the purpose of enslavement or forced labor. 
<P>In June, 1964, 3 young men were working in Mississippi to help African-Americans obtain their civil rights in voting, education and employment. The 3 young men were named Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner. On June 21, 1964, the young men visited a church that had been fire bombed near Philadelphia, Mississippi. After leaving the site of the church bombing, the young men were arrested by members of the Neshoba County Sheriff's Department for speeding. Later that night, they disappeared. 
<P>Within a few days of the disappearance, the FBI began an investigation, and members of the Civil Rights Division visited Mississippi to learn what facts were available about their disappearance. On August 4, 1964, a paid informant of the FBI revealed the location of the bodies of the 3 young civil rights workers. They had been shot, and James Chaney, an African-American, had been severely beaten. In December, 1964, 19 white men, including the sheriff and his deputy, were arrested on state conspiracy charges, but the charges were later dropped. In 1967, after a federal prosecution for conspiracy to deny the young men's civil rights, 7 white men were convicted. 
<P>A case in March 1991 involved the beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles, California,. After the police officers who allegedly beat Mr. King were acquitted in a state court trial, terrible riots broke out in South Central Los Angeles in protest. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and United States Attorney then prosecuted the officers under a federal criminal civil rights statute. The officers were convicted of violating Mr. King's civil rights. 
<P><IMG height=60 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/flame.gif" width=30 align=bottom> The Civil Rights Division also enforces federal criminal civil rights laws that involve "hate crimes." Hate crimes are crimes committed against individuals or institutions because of their race, ethnic background or religion. Other federal laws prohibit church burnings. In 1996, a string of church arsons, especially in a large number of African-American churches, led the President to form a special task force, known as the National Church Arson Task Force, made up of lawyers from the Civil Rights Division, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This Task Force was assigned to investigate and prosecute these church arsons under the federal criminal civil rights statutes. In their report to the President in June 1997, the Task Force reported convictions of 110 individuals in connection with 77 fires at houses of worship. The President also sought and worked with Congress to improve the law that prohibits church arsons. <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Rights of Institutionalized Persons</FONT></H2>
<P>The Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act of 1980 ensures that the rights of persons in institutions are protected against unconstitutional conditions. Those confined in government institutions include persons with disabilities, the elderly in government-run nursing homes, and prisoners. 
<P><IMG height=133 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/cripa.jpg" width=170 align=bottom>In March, 1972, a group of parents, volunteer organizations and individual residents at the Willowbrook State School for the Mentally Retarded filed a federal lawsuit against the State of New York and the administrators of the school to correct conditions at the school. At that time, Willowbrook had a population of 5,700 housed in 43 buildings. Officially 65% over capacity, it was the largest institution of its kind in the United States. Over 75% of the residents were profoundly or severely retarded and over half had been in Willowbrook for more than 20 years. Conditions for the residents at Willowbrook were hazardous to the health, safety and sanity of the residents. The residences were dirty, people didn't have clean clothes to wear, the plumbing didn't work, and there were not enough doctors and nurses to take care of them. During 8 months in 1972, there were over 1,300 reported incidents of injury, assaults or fights. The Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of mental Hygiene in charge of Willowbrook described the institution as a "major tragedy." The Civil Rights Division intervened in the lawsuit as <I> amicus curiae</I>  (which means "friend of the court") to help the parents and others prove that the rights of the residents were being violated. After 3 years of court actions, all the parties to the lawsuit agreed on a settlement to correct the conditions at Willowbrook. It was, however, several years before everything that was wrong with Willowbrook was fixed.
