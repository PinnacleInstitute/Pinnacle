<H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Public Accommodations and Facilities</FONT></H2>Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in places of public accommodation because of race, color, religion, or national origin. Places of public accommodation are hotels, motels, restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums, and concert halls. 
<P><IMG height=144 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/sign.jpg" width=210 align=bottom>Until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, persons from minority groups were excluded from, or segregated in, restaurants, motels, theaters, and other places of public accommodations. On February 1, 1960, 4 African-American students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College went into the Woolworth's store in Greensboro, North Carolina, sat down at the lunch counter and ordered cups of coffee. The waitress refused to serve them coffee unless they stood up to drink it because only whites were allowed to sit at the lunch counter. The black students sat at the lunch counter until the store closed, but were never served their coffee. The next day they returned with more students and the peaceful protest called a "sit-in" was begun. Across the South, peaceful sit-ins by students took place in more than 100 cities in 1960. Although the protesters were beaten, and sometimes sent to jail, they continued to peacefully sit-in until they achieved their goals - desegregation of places of public accommodation. 
<P>In 1961, a new phase of the movement to desegregate places of public accommodation began - the "Freedom Rides." African-Americans were still sitting in the back of the buses in the South and were not permitted to use "whites only" restroom facilities in the terminals even though the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation on interstate buses (buses that traveled between states) in 1946. In May 1961, the first group of 13 Freedom Riders, white and black ranging in age from college students to a 60-year-old professor and his wife, left Washington, DC, on their way via Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi to New Orleans, Louisana. They went in 2 buses. Riders in the first bus were attacked in both Anniston and Birmingham, Alabama. The Freedom Riders on this bus were beaten by men with pipes. The second bus was firebombed just outside of Anniston, Alabama. 
<P>Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in public facilities because of race, color, religion, or national origin. Public facilities are facilities owned, operated or managed by state or local governments, like courthouses or jails. At the same time as the sit-ins and Freedom Rides, other protesters demonstrated against segregation in public facilities. <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Education</FONT></H2>
<P>Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in public schools because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Public schools include elementary schools, secondary schools and public colleges and universities. 
<P><IMG height=245 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/school.jpg" width=281 align=bottom>In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in <I>Brown</I> v. <I>Board of Education</I> that segregation in the public schools was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. But implementation of the Court's decision went slowly, with massive resistance from the states. In 1957, a federal court ordered the desegregation of public schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the 9 black children who were enrolled in Central High School from attending the school. Mobs of angry people greeted the students on the first day of school. These students were prevented from attending the school until President Eisenhower made the National Guard part of the federal army and also sent 1,000 paratroopers of the 101<SUP>st</SUP> Airborne Division of the US Army to protect these 9 children. In September 1958, Governor Faubus closed all the schools in Little Rock to prevent any more black children from attending white schools (see photo). The schools remained closed until August 1959, when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered them re-opened. 
<P>In January 1961, James Meredith, an African-American, applied for admission to the University of Mississippi. Officials at the school returned his application. Mr. Meredith took his case to court. On September 10, 1962, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that he had the right to attend the University of Mississippi. The Governor of Mississippi, Ross Barnett, personally blocked Mr. Meredith from registering at the University even after the Supreme Court ruled. Finally, on September 30, 1962, a Sunday, Mr. Meredith was escorted onto the campus by federal marshals and Civil Rights Division lawyers. Stationed on or near the campus to protect him were 123 deputy federal marshals, 316 US Border Patrolmen, and 97 federal prison guards. Within an hour, the federal forces were attacked by a mob that would grow to number 2,000 and who fought them with guns, bricks, bottles, and Molotov cocktails. The marshals had been ordered not to shoot and so used tear gas to try to stop the rioting. The violence continued until President Kennedy sent 16,000 federal troops to the campus. When it was over, 2 people were dead, 28 marshals had been shot, 160 people were injured, and James Meredith became the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi. <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Employment</FONT></H2>
<P>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 
<P>In 1962, Cesar Chavez set out to organize migrant farm workers in the California grape fields into a union. The farm workers were mostly Hispanic, although there were other ethnic groups represented, and had an average family income of about $2,000 per year. In 1965, the farm workers went on strike in a movement known as La Causa. In 1966, Mr. Chavez led a 250-mile march from Delano to Sacramento to bring attention to the farm workers' conditions. The nonviolent strike lasted 3 years. In the end, most California grapes were grown in fields with Farm Workers Union labor. 
<P>In February 1968, sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, went on strike to protest unfair treatment. During a period of bad weather, 22 black workers had been sent home without pay while white workers were not sent home and were paid. The striking sanitation workers marched for their rights, but no resolution was reached. On several occasions during March, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Memphis to speak, but still no settlement of the strike was made. Dr. King returned to Memphis again on April 3 to lead a march on behalf of the striking workers. On April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel, Dr. King was assassinated. 
<P><IMG height=191 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/fire.jpg" width=150 align=bottom> This recruiting poster was a result of the settlement of a 1976 suit filed against the San Diego Fire Department by the Civil Rights Division because of employment discrimination against women. The efforts of the Division have led to openings for women in other traditionally male-only occupations such as police officer and correctional officer. 
<P>The Department of Justice is charged with fighting employment discrimination by state and local government employers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is responsible for enforcing employment discrimination laws for private employers and for the Federal Government. 
<P>&nbsp; <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Voting Rights</FONT></H2>
<P>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits discrimination in voting practices or procedures because of race and color. In 1957 and 1960, Congress had enacted voting rights laws that took small steps toward increasing minority voting participation for all Americans. The 1965 Act, however, made huge strides towards making voting rights a reality. The Act prohibited literacy tests and poll taxes which had been used to prevent blacks from voting (see <A href="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/backgrd.htm">Background and Introduction</A>). In 1975, Congress recognized the need to protect citizens who did not read or speak English well enough to participate in the political process and expanded the protections of the Voting Rights Act to them. 
<P>In 1963, civil rights activists began an effort to register black voters in Dallas County, Alabama. During 1963 and 1964, although they brought potential voters by the hundreds to the registrar's office in the courthouse in Selma, they were unable to get them registered to vote. In January and February 1965, protests were held in Selma to bring attention to this violation of rights. The protests were met by violence by Sheriff James Clark and his deputies. On February 17, a small civil rights march ended in the shooting of Jimmy Lee Jackson who died from his wounds several days later. The civil rights activists decided to hold a memorial march from Selma to the state capitol in Montgomery on March. 7. 
<P><IMG height=200 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/bridge.jpg" width=283 align=bottom>Approximately 600 marchers started out on the march that Sunday morning. As pictured, when the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus bridge on the outskirts of Selma, they were met by about 200 state troopers, and Sheriff Clark and his deputies mounted on horseback, all armed with tear gas, night sticks and bull whips. The marchers were ordered to turn back. When they did not, they were attacked by the law enforcement officers. The air filled with tear gas and marchers were beaten, whipped and trampled by the horses. Finally, they turned around and returned to Selma. 17 marchers were hospitalized. 
<P>Dr. King and his supporters filed a federal lawsuit requesting to be permitted to proceed with the march. On March 21, the march began again, with federal troops protecting the marchers, and proceeded to Montgomery. In Montgomery, a rally was held on the steps of the state capitol. However, within hours of the end of the march, 4 Ku Klux Klan members shot and killed Viola Liuzzo, a white 39-year-old civil rights volunteer from Detroit, Michigan, who had come to support the Alabama African-Americans. President Lyndon Johnson said, "Mrs. Liuzzo went to Alabama to serve the struggle for justice. She was murdered by the enemies of justice who for decades have used the rope and the gun and the tar and the feather to terrorize their neighbors." In August, 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. 
<P>According to a report of the Bureau of the Census from 1982, in 1960 there were 22,000 African-Americans registered to vote in Mississippi, but in 1966 the number had risen to 175,000. Alabama went from 66,000 African-American registered voters in 1960 to 250,000 in 1966. South Carolina's African-American registered voters went from 58,000 to 191,000 in the same time period. <H2><FONT color=#ff0000>Housing</FONT></H2>
<P>The Fair Housing Act, contained in Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, prohibits discrimination in the sale, financing or rental of housing because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin. 
<P>Shortly after the signing of the Voting Rights Act, in the summer of 1965, a riot erupted in the Watts section of Los Angeles over accusations of police brutality against a black motorist. During the next 4 summers, similar riots and unrest broke out in cities throughout the United States. The quest for civil rights had moved out of the South and spread to the rest of the country. 
<P>In 1966, Dr. King went to Chicago to lead rallies and protests on a number of civil rights issues. In a report of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1959, Chicago had been called "the most residentially segregated large city in the nation." Soon, the attention of all the civil rights activists in Chicago turned to the issue of fair housing. Black residents of Chicago were squeezed into small areas of the city and were unable to find housing outside of those areas. The civil rights movement began to march into white-only areas of Chicago only to be met by mobs of whites. In July 1966, marchers were attacked with stones and bottles. One march of 350 was met by a mob of 4,000. Finally, at the end of August, city leaders met with Dr. King and agreed to a program of fair housing. 
<P>The law first passed in 1968 did not work well. Under the law, the Federal government had a small role in enforcing fair housing laws. In 1988, Congress enacted amendments to the Fair Housing Act that gave the Departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development a large role in enforcing the law. The Department of Justice litigates Fair Housing cases in court, while the Department of Housing and Urban Development investigates and attempts to resolve complaints of housing discrimination. 
<P><IMG height=422 src="http://www.usdoj.gov/kidspage/crt/housing.jpg" width=297 align=bottom> One of the statements on the poster says "Blockbusting is also illegal." Blockbusting is a scare tactic used by some unprincipled real estate agents to get whites to sell their homes at very low prices by telling them that minorities were moving into their neighborhood, and their houses would no longer be worth as much money. These agents would then sell the houses to minorities at highly inflated prices. 
<P>Sometimes people can't live where they want because they are not able to get the money they need to buy the house. If a bank or other business that lends money decides not to loan a person money for the wrong reasons that may violate the Fair Housing Act as illustrated in the following story by Amelia Workman, a junior high schooler. 
<P>Today Josefina was upset, she wanted to move into the neighborhood where her best friend Danielle lived, but she knew she couldn't. She had heard her parents talking about the house so Josefina listened in, thinking it was good news, but what she heard was bad. Her parents said that the bank wouldn't give them a loan to get the house because it was a black neighborhood. 
<P>When Josefina's parents tried to explain this to her she still couldn't understand. Josefina could give them a million reasons why they should move into the house, like the location it was right near her school, she could take the bus home with Danielle, and it was a beautiful house, just to name a few. Josefina wanted so badly to move out of the apartment building they were living in, Josefina just couldn't understand why they couldn't get the loan. I'm 12 years old and a smart Venezuelan girl, and I just can't figure it out, she thought to herself. Josefina knew about racism, and civil rights and all that stuff and her friend Danielle did too. 
<P>Josefina called Danielle so they could talk about it. Josefina thought Danielle was so pretty, she was mixed with white and black which made her hair a nice texture and color. And her skin a pretty complexion. Danielle couldn't understand why the bank would do that either. Josefina had a feeling that what the bank was doing was wrong so the very next day after school Josefina and Danielle went to the library and looked up housing discrimination, fair lending, and loans. They soon found out about <B>Redlining</B>. Redlining is when a bank won't give a loan for a house that is located in a neighborhood where mostly the people are not white. 
<P>She and Danielle found that they could write to the federal office that supervised the bank and complain to them. That office would investigate and, if they agreed that the bank was wrong, Josefina's family could get the loan. They also found out that if the bank had done the same thing to other families as they did to Josefina's, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division could start a lawsuit against the bank for violating the law. 
<P>When Danielle finished reading that Josefina's mouth dropped open. On the way home they talked about their feelings, and tried to be strong but when they both got home Josefina cried. She looked at her skin and then thought about Danielle's. Josefina couldn't sleep that night so she thought up a plan where she would get the bank for <B>redlining</B>. She felt so much better because she just knew that she would get to move into that new house.
