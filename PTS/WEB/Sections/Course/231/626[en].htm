<P><FONT size=3>Essential oils are concentrated and are recommended to be diluted with a carrier oil before using on the skin. They are not recommended for internal use. Avoid contact with the eyes. If any oil accidentally gets in the eyes, flush with milk rather than water. The fatty content of the milk will dilute the oil, whereas water does not.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Avoid camphor, fennel, hyssop, rosemary and possibly other stimulating oils, such as black pepper, cinnamon, clove and nutmeg. On the other hand, a current study at the University of Birmingham in England has shown the ability of Aromatherapy Massage to halt seizures in all but one from a group of twenty-five patients. Dr Tim Betts, who is conducting the study, has found jasmine to be "the one oil to have consistent anticonvulsant properties." </FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=3><B>Homeopathy</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Avoid using eucalyptus and oils from the mint family as they are known to erase the homeopathic blueprint. There are ways to incorporate Aromatherapy and Homeopathy together. It is normally advised to administer the Aromatherapy before the Homeopathy. The potency of the Homeopathic remedy will determine how long one needs to wait before Aromatherapy should be used. This is an area where knowledge is being gathered first-hand by those therapists who are exploring this potentially dynamic therapeutic combination.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=3><B>Photosensitivity</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Some essential oils can increase the skin's sensitivity to the sun, causing sunburn and irritation. Bergamot is one oil to avoid using prior to exposure to the sun. A high quantity of a component called bergaptene is present in Bergamot and is what causes the photosensitivity. An added danger is that once the skin becomes photosensitized, it will always need the added protection from the sun.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=3><B>Pregnancy</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>In addition to the known abortifacients, most sources recommend to avoid essential oils that affect the hormonal system and are emmenogogues (promote menstruation). It is probably wise to err on this side of caution since no one wants to risk the liability of causing a miscarriage. This being the case, the list is fairly long; however, pennyroyal and mugwort are at the top of the list of oils to avoid. Though some suggest to avoid Peppermint, others have found the oil to be useful in alleviating the nausea of morning sickness. Its cooling action may be of comfort during the final weeks prior to delivery, especially during the summer months. Jasmine is suggested to help form the bond between mother and child after the birth. A daily massage on the belly with jojoba, sweet almond, grapeseed or rosa rubiginosa can help reduce stretch marks by keeping the moisture and elasticity of the skin.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>Infants who are massaged seem to benefit greatly from a stronger immune system, faster development and the sense of love that is nurtured during the massages. It is recommended to use only mild essential oils, such as lavender, in lower concentrations (1-2%).</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
