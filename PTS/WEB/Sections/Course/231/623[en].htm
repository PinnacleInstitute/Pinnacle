<P><FONT size=3>A massage is great, but an Aromatherapy Massage is even better! By adding essential oils to a massage oil or lotion, the massage can take on a new dimension of therapeutic possibilities. For example, to help combat respiratory problems like coughing and congestion, add a bit of Eucalyptus Essential Oil to your carrier oil. To help relieve stress and tension, Lavender Essential Oil is a good choice. The list could go on and on, and the only way to really learn about them is to begin using them. The use of Essential Oils also makes the massage experience even more pleasant! All that's needed to start is to add a little Essential Oil to your base vegetable oil. Try just a few drops at first, you can always add if you want to increase the strength. A great beginning group of oils for any massage therapist would be; Lavender, Peppermint, Eucalyptus, Orange, Rosemary, Lemon, and Geranium. After becoming familiar with a few oils, you will find it a pleasure to periodically add to your choices!</FONT><CENTER><FONT color=red size=+2><B>The way to health is to have an aromatic bath and scented massage everyday.</B></FONT>

<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Bath</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Relax and enjoy an Aromatherapy Bath by adding a few drops of your favorite Essential Oils! Fill the tub with warm water, then add your oil just prior to your entering. You might want to use your hand to stir the water a little. Close the doors to keep the aroma in the room while bathing. The warmth from the water will gently encourage the evaporation of the oil and envelope you in its aroma! It is delightful to notice the different "levels" of the oil as it evaporates.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Try adding the soft light of candles to set an even more relaxing mood. An Aromatherapy Bath is also a loving gift that you can give someone! </FONT><FONT size=3>For extra moisturizing, combine Essential Oils with a Carrier Oil, such as, Sweet Almond or Jojoba before adding to the bath. Jojoba is an excellent choice for making a bath oil since it does not leave a "bath-tub ring." Use about 5-10% Essential Oil in your Carrier Oil. This is a good idea if you prefer to use "spicy" Essential Oils, like Cinnamon or Clove, since they could be irritating to sensitive skin.</FONT> 
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Inhalation</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>With a drop or two of Essential Oil on your palms, rub them together to produce a little heat, then cup your nose and inhale. The Essential Oils can either be neat (undiluted), or diluted in a carrier oil. It is advisable to dilute the oils to prevent any irritation to sensitive skin. Inhalation is excellent to use for a short quick burst of aroma!</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Sauna</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Take advantage of the cleansing nature of a sauna or steam room by using essential oils. A convenient and recommended method is to dilute several drops of essential oil in a small spray bottle filled with water. Spray on the rocks, in the air, or even on your body! Essential oils, like Eucalyptus or Niaouli, are excellent to use in a sauna to help clear respiratory congestion. Use some caution since most essential oils are flammable.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Compress</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Add a few drops of essential oil to the basin of water. Dip a folded cloth into the water then ring out any excess before applying to the affected area. Please note that heat will intensify the affect of essential oils.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Facial Steam</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Excellent for facial skin care and for the respiratory tract. Place a few drops of essential oil into a basin of steaming water. Gently stir the water to disperse the oil. Place a towel over the basin and your head. Move your face over the aromatic steam with your eyes closed. Breathe deeply and let the aromatic steam open and cleanse the pores of your skin!</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Environmental Fragrancing</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>There are several ways to enjoy the aroma of essential oils in your home and office. From a simple light bulb ring to the more sophisticated nebulizer units. Using essential oil aroma is a more healthful way to fragrance any room and offers an alternative to the use of synthetic aromatic chemicals. In addition to the aroma, the oils can be selected to enhance a mood or stimulate a discussion. Diffusing lavender before bedtime is a wonderful way to relax and prepare for a good night's sleep. Rosemary and lemon are more energizing and can help you stay awake while cramming for an exam. Jasmine and YlangYlang tend to heighten the feelings of love and romance! Use your imagination and have fun exploring many different oils and combinations.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>First Aid</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Many essential oils have some very practical applications. Lavender is known to reduce the pain and swelling of small burns. We keep a bottle in the kitchen in case we touch a hot pan. Tea tree is excellent first-aid for cuts or bites to avoid infection. Canker sores often disappear overnight after applying a drop of tea tree oil. Peppermint oil is an excellent choice to rub on the back of your neck if you have a tension headache. It is also useful to cool "hot flashes" and reduce nausea.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Natural Perfumes</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Essential Oils and Absolutes are Nature's Perfume. The aroma from a Natural Perfume is fresh and alive, and has the added therapeutic benefits associated with your personal choice of oil. For example, the Essential Oil of Rose is hormonally balancing and promotes a sense of well being and confidence. Of course, there are a few oils that could be worn as "single notes", but the joy of blending can create a fragrance that is personal and powerful. Sandalwood is a lovely base note to blend the more exquisite florals, like Rose, Jasmine or Tuberose. This actually creates what are known as "Attars." After combining the Essential Oils into a personal Natural Perfume, many people add Jojoba Oil. This helps to extend the use of your perfume and it can be applied directly to the skin without being too strong, or irritating. Jojoba is a good choice to use with Natural Perfumes because it will not go rancid like a vegetable oil carrier will do.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
