<P><FONT size=3>Creating a pleasant and effective blend of essential oils, or synergy, is a work of art that is as gratifying as it is therapeutic. There are many, many recipes for combining essential oils. Some are better than others and you will find that your own tastes will play a role as you become more familiar with the oils.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Create your own massage, bath and body oils by combining essential oils with a carrier oil. Most full body massage oils have about 3-5% of essential oil concentration. Bath oils can have a higher concentration of essential oils, perhaps 5-8%. The two things to keep in mind when deciding on the percentage concentration is "how will the oil be used?" and "what oils am I using?" An overall body oil should have less of a concentration of essential oils than an oil for a specific area, such as the feet. Essential oils that are more powerful, such as Rose or Immortelle, can be used in much smaller percentage than say Lavender or Bergamot. Practice and experimentation is the key to creating a good blend that becomes a personal favorite!</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><B>Jojoba</B> - Jojoba "oil" is actually a liquid vegetable wax, rather than an oil. This gives jojoba a long shelf life, even after more than a year, it does not go rancid like a vegetable oil is prone to do. The molecular structure of jojoba resembles the structure of the sebum produced by our skin. This enables jojoba to cleanse the skin by dissolving sebum that has become trapped in the skin's pores. It is a nourishing and moisturizing oil that is very good to use for massage, bath and body care preparations. Another benefit to using jojoba as a bath oil base is that it does not leave a "bath tub ring" like a vegetable oil will do!</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Grapeseed</B> - This oil has an attractive light green color and is a lighter oil than most other choices. Grapeseed penetrates the skin rather quickly and therefore seems less "oily." It can be used to thin heavier oils producing a more moderate viscosity.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Sweet Almond</B> - This is perhaps the most commonly used carrier oil. It is very popular among massage therapists because of its versatility. It can be used on all skin types and is especially good for "itchy" skin conditions in need of added moisture. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Rosa Rubiginosa</B> - Also known as Rosa Mosqueta, it is the oil from a seed of a South American Rosehip. It has remarkable healing and skin regenerative properties. Among the benefits shown through research in South America are this oils ability to reduce scarring and deep wrinkle lines. It has even had success in reducing the "hardness" of old scar tissue. One recipe that has been helpful to soften old scar tissue is a combination of a little Immortelle in a base of Rosa Rubiginosa! It is an excellent carrier oil for many different skin care preparations. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Inophyllum Calophyllum</B> - A rich and greenish to brown colored oil from a fruit tree that grows in lush Madagascar. It has a distinctive aroma that I consider somewhat peppery. It is sometimes used for general skin care; however, its primary benefits are seen for the hair and scalp. It gives hair a lustrous sheen and helps nourish and heal dry scalp conditions. There is a recipe that has offered some relief for shingles (zona) that uses this oil. It combines Innophyllum Calophyllum and Ravensara Essential Oil with another carrier oil. </FONT>
