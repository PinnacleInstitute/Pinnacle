<BR>
<P><FONT size=3>Aromatherapy is more than just smelling something to make you well. It is a beautiful art that is budding into a science as we look more closely at the subtle, yet profound effect that Essential Oils have on our mind and body. Aromatherapy is the art and science of using Essential Oils to relax, balance and stimulate the body, mind and spirit. Essential Oils can be used in a wide variety of ways for many different purposes from athlete's foot to enlightenment and almost every point between! </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The word "Aromatherapy" was first coined by Rene Gattefosse in 1910 after he experienced the power of lavender oil to heal a burn he had suffered during a laboratory accident. The deliberate use of aromatic material is probably as old as the human race with references to its religious, medicinal and sensual use in many ancient texts. However, never before have so many different essential oils been so easily obtained. In today's age, the level of communication and transportation is able to assist in gathering essential oils from all over the globe and making them available to all who want to explore them.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>What are Essential Oils?</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Essential Oils are the volatile aromatic essence produced by hundreds of aromatic plants through the process of photosynthesis. When you smell a rose, it is the precious essential oil evaporating from the petals that releases the aroma. Only a tiny amount of oil is produced by each rose. In fact, it takes about thirty roses to yield one drop of pure essential oil! Not all plants are so sparing with their essential oil production, but this is why pure rose oil is among the most expensive to purchase. Even though rose oil is very expensive, it is important to note that only a small amount is needed for most applications. Think of this as an oil's energy, not so much the type, but the intensity. Higher energy essential oils are those that require relatively large amounts of plant material to produce each drop of oil.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>While most are familiar with aromatic plants that store their essence in the flower, there are many other plants that store their essential oil in the leaves, peel, root, bark or seed. This determines the part of the plant that is gathered for distillation.</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Essential Oil Distillation</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Essential Oils are obtained through a process of steam distillation. Aromatic plant material is harvested and filled into a canister through which the steam rises. The steam gently lifts the precious, volatile oil from the plant material through a condenser coil that cools the steam back to liquid droplets. This oil and water combination flows into a Florentine flask where the essential oil naturally separates and floats atop the water. Each plant has its own unique characteristics and will yield its best oil to those distillers who have learned the subtle techniques through many seasons.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Aromatherapy distillation requires a correct balance of time and temperature to release the most valuable molecules from the aromatic plant material without destroying them. This careful distillation can take a much longer time, but it allows the plant to release its full depth of aromatic complexity.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Pure Essential Oils carry a tremendous amount of plant energy; therefore, even a very small quantity can have significant healing power. Alchemists regarded essential oils as the essence or soul of the plant and their distillation provided essential oils to natural pharmacies, known as Apothecaries, during the Renaissance!</FONT>
<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>Origin and Cultivation</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The location grown and cultivation method affects an oils quality. The type of soil, amount of rainfall, sunlight, humidity, the whole environment plays a role in the quality of essential oil that is produced by the aromatic plant. Since these differences can be quite noticeable, we believe that this information should be included with every essential oil sold for Aromatherapy purposes. The following key shows the various cultivation methods:</FONT>
<UL>
<P><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT color=blue><B>Certified Organic Farming (CO):</B></FONT> Certified by independent monitoring agencies to be grown without the use of any artificial fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. They are distilled in organic facilities according to the highest therapeutic standards. </FONT>
<P>
<P><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT color=blue><B>Organic Farming (O):</B></FONT> Farms who practice organic cultivation, yet are not independently monitored. This is usually due to the lack of an agency in the area. Farms in these more remote areas are usually unable to purchase the herbicides and fertilizers due to their cost. Personal contact confirms that their cultivation is organic. </FONT>
<P>
<P><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT color=blue><B>Selected Farming (S):</B></FONT> Skillfully selected and tested for the highest possible quality...in cases where no organic monitoring agencies exist and without close personal contact, oils are chosen with care. </FONT>
<P>
<P><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT color=blue><B>Wildcrafted (W):</B></FONT> These are plants which are gathered in their natural environment and are essentially free of any artificial intervention. They are truly organic...touched only by the hand of nature! </FONT>
<P>
<P><FONT size=3></FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><FONT color=blue><B>Absolute (Abs):</B></FONT> These are oils extracted through the use of solvents rather than steam distillation. Often a two-step process with an aromatic waxy substance called a concrete, from which the oil is distilled.</FONT>

<P><FONT color=blue size=+1><B>The Spirit of Aromatherapy</B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Pure essential oils carry an intelligence that communicates with a deep part of ourselves. The book of Genesis states, "And the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life..." For those of us who hold to the Creation story, this account reveals the significance of breath taken in through the nostrils. This life force is also referred to as Prana. Aromatic molecules fit into our olfactory nerves in a very specific way and send impulses to the limbic system. The limbic system is thought to be the seat of memory and emotions. All of our life experiences may be coded by the aroma that was present during that experience. This is why it is common to recall memories, even distant childhood memories, when smelling essential oils. In this way, Aromatherapy may be used to release emotions held in our bodies from past experiences.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>It is challenging to describe an aroma. Aromas have stirred many poets to reach deep into their vocabulary to capture their essence. The process of describing an aroma is an exercise in what some call "whole-brain" thinking. In the brain, an aroma tends to stimulate the romantic, creative or right-hemisphere. Yet often our classic, rational, left-hemisphere is called on to describe and categorize an aroma. This process can create new connections or neural pathways which may also benefit other mental processes. It is not uncommon for those who develop a relationship with the oils to experience a heightened sense of subtle awareness. This can take the form of telepathy, serendipity and life changes.</FONT>
