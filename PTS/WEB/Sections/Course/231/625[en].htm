<CENTER><FONT color=green size=+3><B>Aromatherapy Glossary </B></FONT></CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3><B>Absolute</B> - A Solvent Extracted Oil, rather than Steam Distilled. Solvent Extraction is the only practical way to obtain the aromatic material from many of the most delicate florals, such as jasmine, tuberose and narcissus. Absolutes are often colored since they retain more of the less volatile molecules. While there use in Aromatherapy is sometimes debated, they are prized by perfumers and provide a rich and lasting aroma when worn. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Acute</B> - Typically a short term result of a chronic, or long-term, problem. We generally heed an acute symptom fairly quickly. You might think of this as the proverbial "whack on the side of the head" to get our attention if we have been ignoring a chronic and unhealthy situation in our life. Sooner or later, chronic problems become acute, so it is best to maintain awareness of the more subtle clues that your body may be giving you to signal changes that need to take place. Essential Oils are able to work on a more subtle and long term level than many conventional medical approaches. This makes Aromatherapy a valuable compliment in treating many of the ailments which plague our modern society.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Adaptogenic</B> - The ability of an oil, or other substance, to benefit in seemingly contradictory ways, yet exerting an influence to return the body to its natural state of health. For example, lavender is known to be able to relax the body and mind and is helpful with insomnia, yet lavender is also uplifting and refreshing to a mind that is depressed and lethargic. This ability to interact with the body to assist in the most meaningful and healthful way is an indication of their intelligence and value to mankind.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Adulteration</B> - Due to the high cost of many Essential Oils, the practice of adulteration is tempting for some manufacturers as an effort to either reduce their prices or increase their profits. It is impossible for a 1/2 oz of Jasmine to cost less than $10 unless it has been adulterated or diluted in some way. Melissa is another commonly adulterated oil. When adulteration is intentionally used to deceive an unsuspecting consumer, it is wrong.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Aphrodisiac</B> - Many Essential Oils, either through their pleasurable aroma, or their affect on the hormonal/physical system, increase sexual desire. These oils are commonly referred to as aphrodisiacs. Some of the more well known aphrodisiacs are Jasmine, YlangYlang, Clary Sage, Sandalwood and Patchouli. Some of the less known aphrodisiacs include Black Pepper, Coriander, Cardamom, Cinnamon and Champaca.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Aromatherapy</B> - The Art and Science of using Essential Oils to Relax, Balance and Stimulate the Body, Mind and Spirit!</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Base Notes</B> - These are the most tenacious aromatic components that are among the last to evaporate. They are much less volatile than their "top" or "middle" note counterparts. Aromatic base notes are the ones that you can still smell on your skin several hours after they were first applied. Therapeutically, they are the deepest workers, helping with longer term ailments of a more chronic nature.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Carrier Oil</B> - Any vegetable oil that is used to "carry" the Essential Oils. Since Essential Oils should be diluted for use in Bath and Massage, a carrier oil is used. The carrier oils themselves can be selected for their therapeutic benefits. Avoid Mineral and Petroleum based oils.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Chronic</B> - An ailment that develops over a period of time and tends to be ever present, but is sometimes easy to overlook and just "live with." Many of todays health concerns are brought about through chronic type problems, such as stress. Physical problems that result from chronic situations can sometimes only be treated through a longer term healing process that most often include lifestyle changes to reduce the cause of the ailment.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Cineo</B>l - A fairly common component in many different Essential Oils. It is characterized by the penetrating, often cool, aroma reminiscent of vaporizing rubs. Oils with a high cineol component are useful for respiratory complaints, such as coughing, catarhh and congestion. Eucalyptus oil is among the most common of cineol-type oils, yet there are many others, such as Niaouli, extra, Cajeput and Ravensara that are very high in cineol.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Cold Pressed</B> - Vegetable Carrier Oils are extracted by pressing the seeds to release their oil. Sometimes the process of "expressing" the oil from the peels of citrus fruit is also called "cold pressing."</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Concrete</B> - The richly aromatic compound made up of the plant oils and waxes extracted from plant material, usually high class florals, through the solvent extraction process. Concretes can be worn as perfume. In order to make an absolute, the heavier molecules of the plant waxes are separated from the lighter oils using alcohol. Then the alcohol is distilled off, leaving the liquid absolute.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Dilution</B> - Essential Oils are not usually recommended to be used "neat" (undiluted) on the skin; therefore, they need to be diluted in an appropriate "carrier." The carriers are often vegetable oils, but may also be alcohol, as in the case of Eau de Colognes or Eau de Toilette. If labeled correctly, diluted Essential Oils are not to be considered "adulterated.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Enfleurage</B> - A process of extracting the aromatic compounds from delicate flowers and blossoms. The traditional method is to place a layer of aromatic plant material between two layers of pork fat. The fat draws the aromatic substance from the plants and adding new plant material, the fat becomes laden with the aroma. The fat is then dissolved with alcohol which separates the fat from the oil, then the alcohol is distilled off, leaving the absolute created from the process of enfleurage. This is a much more labor intensive process than the more common extraction process involving solvents.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Expectorant</B> - Promoting the clearing of congestion from the sinus and chest area. Essential Oils with a high cineol content, ie. eucalyptus, niaouli, ravensara and cajeput, have expectorant qualities. Also balsamic wood oils, such as cedar, fir and even sandalwood have this quality. Oils with this property are an excellent alternative to petroleum based salves.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Expression</B> - Most citrus oils are the result of expressing the fruit rind or peel. The peels are macerated (shred) and mixed with water, then pressed. This releases the oil from the pockets within the peel and the oil flows out along with the water. The oil is then separated and any solids are filtered out.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Fixative</B> - An oil that is able to slow the evaporation of the more volatile oils. Fixative oils are usually base notes in a blend and perform the valuable function of creating a longer lasting, harmonious aroma. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Floral Water</B> - The recondensed water that has risen as steam through the aromatic plant material during distillation. This water is aromatic and contains the water soluable nutrients from the plant. They are also called Hydrosols, or Hydrolates, and should not be confused with a manufactured "floral water," which is a combination of purified water, aromatic essence and some form of emulsifier. Pure Floral Waters are an excellent addition to any skin care program, assisting in hydrating and toning the skin. Spray or splash floral water on your skin before applying a skin care oil. The oil applied over your skin moistened by the floral water will hold that moisture in the skin, helping to alleviate dryness. There are recipes that use floral waters for cooking. A little splash of Peppermint, or Neroli floral water in your ice water on a hot summer day is particularly refreshing!</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Infusion</B> - The process of soaking plant material in a carrier oil to release the soluble constituents into the carrier oil. This is often done with Marigold (Calendula) and St Johnswort; however, there are many more types of infusions becoming available for a variety of purposes.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Insomnia</B> - The inability to sleep when your body needs to rest. Oftentimes this is caused by too much stress and tension in our lives. The Essential Oil of Lavender has been proven to assist in quieting the mind and body to allow for sleep and could provide insomniacs with some welcome relief! </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Middle Note</B> - These are the oils, or aromatic components within the oils, that are neither the first, nor the last to evaporate. They form the middle, or body, of the aroma. An example of a middle note Essential Oil is Lavender.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Olfaction</B> - The physiological process of smelling. Your olfactory sense is the sense of smell. This process begins when aromatic molecules stimulate the receptors within the nose and a signal is sent through the olfactory bulb, which is located between the eyes above the nose, then on to the limbic system. It is through our nose that our Central Nervous System actually has direct contact with the external environment. Certain aromas, particularly chemical and synthetic, can give us a headache in that area. This happens when the olfactory bulb is overstimulated and attempts block those aromatic impulses from reaching our limbic system. Since the olfactory cells are constantly regenerating, our sense of smell can become either more acute, or more deadened, depending in large part to the environments our noses are in! After many years of smelling Pure Essential Oils, the sense of smell becomes very trained and is able to distinguish subtleties that many people simply cannot smell. Those who have developed this ability are called "The Nose" in companies that deal with aromatic materials. The Nose is able to distinguish the region that an oil comes from and maybe even the year it was produced!</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Percolation</B> - A different form of distillation where the steam is forced from the top down through the aromatic plant material, rather than rising from beneath the material.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Photosensitizing</B> - This is something that increases your skin's sensitivity to the harmful affects of the sun. The bergaptene in Bergamot Peel oil is photosensitizing so its use should be avoided prior to being out in the sun.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Single Note</B> - The pure and unblended Essential Oil from a single plant.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Synergy</B> - A combination of Essential Oil "Single Notes" that when balanced correctly provide an even greater therapeutic or aromatic benefit than each of the Essential Oils could provide alone. This embodies the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts!</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Tonic</B> - A remedy with general strengthening and fortifying qualities. Tonics are excellent to use for prevention, in addition to assisting the body back to health.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Top Note</B> - The most volatile aromatic molecules that evaporate quickly. They are the ones that you smell first and do no last as long as the middle and base notes. Therapeutically they are fast acting and help relieve short term, more acute problems. Since they do tend to evaporate so quickly, they are often combined with a fixative that slows their release into the air.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Toxicity</B> - Much of the information regarding the toxicity of Essential Oils is passed along from research that may or may not have been done with Essential Oils themselves. However, with the lack of better information, it is probably wise to exercise caution with oils that are considered toxic. The affects of toxicity from Essential Oils are of a longer term nature and do not manifest themselves immediately. Our bodies have the natural ability to rid itself of toxins, yet if a toxin is repeatedly brought into the body it can break down our natural systems and cause a build-up of any harmful substance. To be safe, only use toxic oils sparingly and do not use them continuously over long periods of time.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Viscosity</B> - A common term used to describe the thickness of an Essential Oil. There is a precise measuring scale employed to rate an oil's viscosity; however, it will probably suffice to know that the higher the viscosity of an oil, the more liquid it is. Water is a high viscosity liquid, as opposed to molasses, which is very low viscosity.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Volatile</B> - The characteristic of an Essential Oil to evaporate. The more volatile an oil is, the more quickly it will evaporate!</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
