<P align=center><FONT size=3>1. Group discussion of their experiences of the disaster is particularly important among adolescents. They need the opportunity to vent as well as to normalize the extreme emotions that come up for them. A good way to stimulate such a discussion is for the teacher to share his/her own reactions to the disaster. They may need considerable reassurance that even extreme emotions and "crazy thoughts" are normal in a disaster. It is important to end such discussions on a positive note (e.g., What heroic acts were observed? How can we be of help at home or in the community? How could we be more prepared for a disaster?). Such discussion is appropriate for any course of study in that it can facilitate a return to more normal functioning.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>2. Break the class into small groups and have them develop a disaster plan for their home, school or community. This can be helpful in repairing a sense of mastery and security, as well as having practical merit. The small groups might then share their plans in a discussion with the entire class. Encourage students to share their plans with their families. They may wish to conduct a "Family Disaster Preparedness" meeting and invite family members and disaster preparedness experts to participate.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>3. Conduct a class discussion and/or support a class project on how the students might help the community rehabilitation effort. It is important to help them develop concrete and realistic ways to be of assistance. This helps them to overcome the feelings of helplessness, frustration, and "survivors guilt" that are common in disaster situations.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>4. Classroom activities that relate the disaster to course study can be a good way to help the students integrate their own experience or observations while providing specific learning experiences. In implementing the following suggestions ,or similar ideas of your own, it is very important to allow time for the students to discuss feelings that are stimulated by the projects or issues covered.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>Journalism</B></I>--Have the students write stories that cover different aspects of the disaster. These might include community impact, lawsuits that result from the disaster, human interest stories from fellow students, geological impact, etc. Issues such as accurate reporting of catastrophic events as sensationalism might be discussed. The stories might be compiled into a special student publication.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Science</I></B>--Cover scientific aspects of the disaster, e.g., discuss climate condition, geological impact, etc. Project about stress: physiological responses to stress and methods of dealing with it. Discuss how flocks of birds, herds of animals, etc., band together and work in a threatening or emergency situation. What can be learned from their instinctive actions?</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>English composition</I></B>--Have the students write about their own experiences in the disaster. Such issues as the problems that arise in conveying heavy emotional tone without being overly dramatic might be discussed.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>Literature</B></I>--Have students report on natural disaster in Greek mythology, American and British literature, in poetry.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Psychology</I></B>--Have the students apply what they have learned in the course to the emotions, behaviors, and stress reactions they felt or observed in the disaster. Cover post-traumatic stress syndrome. Have a guest speaker from the mental health professions involved in disaster work with victims, etc. Have students discuss (from their own experience) what things have been most helpful in dealing with disaster-related stress. Have students develop a mental health education brochure discussing emotional/behavioral reactions to disaster and things that are helpful in coping with disaster-related stress. Have students conduct a survey among their parents or friends: What was the most dangerous situation in which you ever found yourself? How did you react psychologically?</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>Peer counseling</B></I>--Provide special information on common responses to disaster; encourage the students' helping each other integrate their own experiences.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Health</I></B>--discuss emotional reactions to disaster, the importance of taking care of one's own emotional and physical well-being, etc. Discuss health implications of the disaster, e.g., water contamination, food that may have gone bad due to lack of refrigeration, and other health precautions and safety measures. Discuss the effects of adrenalin on the body during stress and danger. A guest speaker from Public Health and/or Mental Health might be invited to the class.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>Art</B></I>--Have the students portray their experiences of the disaster in various art media. This may be done individually or as a group effort (e.g., making a mural).</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>Speech/Drama</B></I>--Have the students portray the catastrophic emotions that come up in response to a disaster. Have them develop a skit or play on some aspects of the event. Conduct a debate: Women are more psychologically prepared to handle stress than men (or vice-versa).</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>Math</B></I>--Have the class solve mathematical problems related to the impact of the disaster (e.g., build questions around gallons of water lost, cubic feet of earth that moved in a mud slide).</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B>History</B></I>--Have students report on natural disasters that have occurred in your community or geographic area and what lessons were learned that can be useful in preparing for future disasters.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I>Civics/Government</I></B>--Study governmental agencies responsible for aid to victims, how they work, how effective they are, the political implications within a community. Examine the community systems and how the stress of the disaster has affected them. Have students invite a local governmental official to class to discuss disaster precautions, warning systems, etc. Have students contact the California Seismic Safety Commission of State legislators regarding recent disaster-related bills passed or pending. How will this legislation affect your community and other areas of the state? Visit local emergency operating centers and learn about their functions.</FONT>
