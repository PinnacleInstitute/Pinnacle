<P><FONT size=3>During disasters, many families suffer from the onset of sudden stress. Severe stress can disrupt functioning. Overtime, relief from stress enables families to eventually reestablish equilibrium. Informed intervention can speed up this process and in many instances can prevent serious problems later.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>On the other hand, families that were dysfunctional (prior to the disaster), will not be cured through intervention. The most vulnerable and those with the lowest resources were most susceptible before the disaster and remained so after the disaster.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>A theory worthy of consideration in dealing with disaster stress is attachment theory. Throughout life, young children are more resilient if they have become attached to at least one significant adult. Being able to trust at least one adult pulls them through stressful times. Secure attachment provides a foundation for healthy development and healthy mental functioning.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Although attachment exists all of the time, it is particularly evident when a child is ill, tired, or afraid. A child searches out that person who makes them feel safe and secure. Stress occurs when that person is not available...in proximity or emotionally. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Separation is the flip side of attachment. Any indication that separation may occur causes stress. Children going into a new child care situation, to a new class, or to spend the night away from home (even to camp), can be stressed due to separation. Children can bring an attachment item along (blanket, bear) to child care, to ease the separation from parents. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>The more severe the disaster, the more serious the threat and the greater the chance for actual separation or loss. Sleeping alone in a strange place, being separated from parents and other family members, losing toys and pets are ways children were affected during the disaster.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Parent should be assured that they are not spoiling their child by responding to fright. If feelings are not recognized, then buried and later may surface...when the reason is not as evident. Significant adult availability and responsiveness is of great importance to move through the stressful time.</FONT>
