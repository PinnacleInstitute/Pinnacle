<P align=center></I><FONT size=3>1. Availability of toys that encourage play reenactment of children's experiences and observations during the disaster can help children integrate these experiences. These might include fire trucks, dump trucks, rescue trucks, ambulances, building blocks or playing with puppets or dolls as ways for the child to ventilate and act out his or her own feelings about what has occurred.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>2. Children need close physical contact during times of stress to help them reestablish ego boundaries and a sense of security. Games that involve physical touching among children within a structure are helpful in this regard. Some examples might be:</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>a. Ring Around the Rosie</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>b. London Bridge</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>c. Duck, Duck, Goose</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>3. Providing extra amounts of finger foods, in small portions, and fluids is a concrete way of supplying the emotional and physical nourishment children need in times of stress. Oral satisfaction is especially necessary as children tend to revert to more regressive behavior in response to feeling that their survival or security is threatened.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>4. Have the children do a mural on long paper with topics such as what happened in your house (school or neighborhood) when the big storm hit (earthquake, etc.). This is recommended for small groups with discussion afterward facilitated by an adult.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>5. "Short stories" dictated to an adult on a one-to-one basis on such topics as "What I do and don't like about the rain." This activity can help the child verbalize his/her fears, as well as to perhaps get back in touch with previous positive associations with the disruptive phenomena.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>6. Have the children draw pictures about the disaster and then discuss the pictures in small groups. This activity allows them to vent their experiences and to discover that others share their fears.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>7. Do a group collage.</FONT>
