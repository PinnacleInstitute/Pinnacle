<P><I><B><FONT size=3>Pre-School Age Children</FONT></B></I>
<P><FONT size=3>Behavior such as bedwetting, thumb sucking, baby talk, or a fear of sleeping alone may intensify in some younger children, or reappear in children who had previously outgrown them. They may complain of very real stomach cramps or headaches, and be reluctant to go to school. It's important to remember that these children are not "being bad". They are afraid. Here are some suggestions to help them cope with their fears:</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Reassure pre-schoolers that they're safe</B>. Provide extra comfort and contact by discussing the child's fears at night, by telephoning during the day and with extra physical comforting.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Get a better understanding of a child's feelings about the disaster</B>. Encouraging children to draw pictures about the disaster, and then discussing them, will offer insight into each child's particular fears and concerns. You can work to structure children's play so that it remains constructive, serving as an outlet for expressing fear or anger.</FONT>
<P><B><I><FONT size=3>School Age Children</FONT></I></B>
<P><FONT size=3>Children this age may ask many questions about the disaster, and it's importance that you try to answer them in clear and simple language. If a child is concerned about a parent who is distressed, don't tell a child not to worry doing so will just make him or her worry more. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Here are several important points to remember with grade-school-age children:</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>False reassurance does not help this age group</B>. Don't say disasters will never affect your family again; children will know this isn't true. Instead say "I'll always try to keep you safe," or "Adults are working very hard to make things safer for next time." Children's fears often get worse around bed time, so you might want to stick around until the child falls asleep in order to make him or her feel protected.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Monitor children's media viewing</B>. Images of the disaster and the damage are extremely frightening to children, so consider limiting the amount of media coverage they see. A good way to do this without calling attention to your own concern is to regularly schedule an activity - story reading, drawing, movies, or letter writing, for example during the news hour.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Allow them to express themselves through play or drawing</B>. As with younger children, school-age children sometimes find comfort in expressing themselves through playing games or drawing scenes of the disaster. Allowing them to do so, and then talking about it gives you the story they have expressed in pictures with an emphasis on personal safety.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B>Don't be afraid to say "I don't know</B>." Part of keeping discussion of the disaster open and honest is not being afraid to say you don't know how to answer a child's question. When such an occasion arises, explain to your child that disasters are very unpredictable, and they cause things that even adults have trouble dealing with. Temper this by explaining that, even so, adults will always work very hard to keep children safe and secure.</FONT>
<P><I><B><FONT size=3>Adolescents</FONT></B></I>
<P><FONT size=3>Encourage youth to work out their concerns about the disaster. Adolescents may try to downplay their worries. It is generally a good idea to talk about these issues, keeping the lines of communication open and remaining honest about the financial, physical and emotional impact of the disaster on your family.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Adolescents typically are going through an identity phase of development. Their sense of "who they are" at this point in their lives may be tied to possessions and friends. Having to transfer schools may be traumatic and telling friends they are living in a shelter equally difficult.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Offer support and encouragement that things will get better and elicit their contribution to work on repairs or prevention of additional damage.</FONT>
