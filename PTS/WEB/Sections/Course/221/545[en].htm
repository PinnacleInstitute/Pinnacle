<P align=center><FONT size=3><I>Greet each child warmly each day.</I> That transition from parent to teacher is an important one. Often mornings are extremely stressful for families. Children may have been yelled at, hurried, and given breakfast in the car. A warm smile or hug as a child walks in the door can go a long way to help a child feel accepted and wanted.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>Spend time with each child every day.</I> Even if it's just for one or two minutes, get down on the child's level, make eye contact, listen, and watch.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>Value each child.</I> Children learn to value themselves through the eyes (and words) of others. What you say (or don't say) to a child has tremendous impact.</FONT><I>
<P><FONT size=3>Eliminate stressful situations from your classroom and routines.</FONT></I><FONT size=3> Ask yourself the following questions: </FONT>

<P><B><FONT size=3>Parent and Teachers can Assist Children</FONT></B>
<P><FONT size=3>In a calm, supportive manner talk honestly about the facts of the disaster. Falsely minimizing the disaster will not end the children's concerns.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Encourage children to share their feelings and discuss their experiences.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Methods for Helping Children Cope in School:</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>Story-telling.</I> Oral or written story-telling are among the methods that can be used to help children reenact their experiences in a constructive manner. Encouraging group discussion after each child relates his/her story allows the children to assist each other.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>Arts projects.</I> Encouraging children to draw what they have felt, wished or dreamed after a disaster allows them to express their feelings. Like story-telling, the drawings can be shared during a period of group discussion. Non-verbal activities promote the sharing of feelings and the beginning of grieving.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>Group projects.</I> In a discussion led by their teacher, children can discuss what they could do to assist with the recovery efforts. Examples include gathering books and toys for the relief effort or working together on a clean-up project, especially in schools that have been seriously affected. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>During the disaster and during recovery, there are many concerns about child care. Where are children safe? Who can watch them while parents are busy in "fighting the disaster" or assisting with a clean-up?</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Some possibilities are churches, clergy/members, child care facilities, relatives, some high school students or elderly in community. Check for after school or summer school activities this would give the child a meaningful place to be and would free your time for dealing with the crisis. Other ideas include: Library programs; foster grandparents agencies; 4-H Club; church youth groups; child care centers.</FONT>
<P><B><FONT size=3>Classroom Activities</FONT></B>
<P><FONT size=3>Many teachers respond to disasters with creative classroom activities to assist their students in ventilating and integrating their experiences. Some of these activities are appropriate for various age groups. They are meant to be vehicles for expression and discussion for your students, important steps in the healing process. These are examples of what can be done. They can be used to stimulate your own ideas and can be adapted to meet your own students' needs and your teaching style.</FONT>
