<P align=center><FONT size=3>Spend more time with your child, using at least part of that time to talk.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Some comfort may be restored through recreating familiar surroundings (i.e. obtaining copies of photos from family and friends and allowing the child to replace stuffed animals).</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Children can be expected to have greater difficulty with times of separation (school drop-offs, bedtime) so extra reassurance is important. Let your child know where you are. Daytime phone calls may be increased.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Monitor you child's viewing of the disaster on television and other media. Repeated viewing is traumatic. If possible, watch television with your child.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Allow the child to discuss the disaster, but do not force it. When discussing it, emphasize that the child is now safe.</FONT>
