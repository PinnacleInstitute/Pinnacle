<P><FONT size=3>1. For the younger children, availability of toys that encourage expressive play reenactment of their experiences and observations during the disaster can be helpful in their integrating these experiences. These might include ambulances, dump trucks, fire trucks, building blocks, and dolls. Playing with puppets can provide ways for the older children, as well, to ventilate their feelings.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>2. Help or encourage the children to develop skits or puppet shows about what happened in the disaster. Encourage them to include anything positive about the experience as well as those aspects that were frightening or disconcerting.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>3. Stimulate group discussion about disaster experiences by showing your own feelings, fears or experiences during the disaster. It is very important to legitimize their feelings and to help them feel less isolated. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>4. Have the children brainstorm on their own classroom or family disaster plan. What would they do? What would they take if they had to evacuate? How would they contact parents? How should the family be prepared? How could they help the family? Encourage them to discuss these things with their families.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>5. Encourage class activities in which children can organize or build projects (scrapbooks, replicas, etc.), thus giving them a sense of mastery and control over events.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>6. Have the children color the pictures in "The Awful Rain and How It Made Me Feel" (or similar material appropriate to the disaster). <I>Encourage the children to talk about their own feelings</I> during and after the disaster.</FONT>
