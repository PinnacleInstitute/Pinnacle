<P><B> Spelling and Grammar Check</B>
<P>Word will automatically check for spelling and grammar errors as you type unless you turn this feature off. Spelling errors are noted in the document with a red underline. Grammar errors are indicated by a green underline. To disable this feature, select <B>Tools|Options</B> from the menu bar and click the <B>Spelling and Grammar tab</B> on the dialog box.

<LI>If the word is spelled correctly, click the <B>Ignore</B> button or click the <B>Ignore All</B> button if the word appears more than once in the document.

If the correct spelling is not suggested, enter the correct spelling in the <B>Not In Dictionary</B> box and click the <B>Change</B> button. 
<LI>If the word is spelled correctly and will appear in many documents you type (such as your name), click the <B>Add</B> button to add the word to the dictionary so it will no longer appear as a misspelled word. 
</OL>As long as the <B>Check Grammar</B> box is checked in the <B>Spelling and Grammar</B> dialog box, Word will check the grammar of the document in addition to the spelling. If you do not want the grammar checked, remove the checkmark from this box. Otherwise, follow these steps for correcting grammar:
