<P><B> Menus </B> 
<P>When you begin to explore Word 2000, you will notice a significant change in the menu structure if you are familiar with previous versions of Word. The menus in Word 2000 display only the commands you have recently used. &nbsp;To view all options in each menu, you must click the double arrows at the bottom of the menu. The images below show the Format menu collapsed (left) and expanded (right) after the double arrows at the bottom of the menu were clicked:

<P><B> Shortcut Menus</B>  
<P>These features allow you to access various Word commands faster than using the options on the menu bar. View shortcut menus by right-clicking with the mouse. The options on this menu will vary depending on the element that was right-clicked. For example, the shortcut menu below is produced by right-clicking on a bulleted list. 
<P align=center><IMG height=207 alt="[Shortcut menu]" src="http://www.fgcu.edu/support/office2000/word/images/shortcutmenu.gif" width=168 border=1> 
<P>Actions such as "Decrease Indent" and "Increase Indent" are only applicable to lists and therefore only appear on the list shortcut menu. The shortcut menus are helpful because they only display the options that can be applied to the item that was right-clicked and, therefore, prevent searching through the many menu options. 
<P><B> Toolbars </B> 
<P>Many toolbars displaying shortcut buttons are also available to make editing and formatting quicker and easier. Select <B>View|Toolbars</B> from the menu bar to select the toolbars. The toolbars that are already displayed on the screen are checked. Add a toolbar simply by clicking on the name.

<P><B> Customizing Toolbars</B>  
<P>There may be certain actions on a toolbar that you do not use and there may also be commands that you execute often but that are not located on any toolbar. Word toolbars can be customized so these commands can be added and deleted. 
<OL>
<LI>Select <B>View|Toolbars|Customize</B> and click the <B>Commands</B> tab.

<LI>Drag the command with the mouse to the desired location on the toolbar and release the mouse button.
