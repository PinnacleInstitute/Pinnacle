<H3><A name=7>Will having an eating disorder keep me from getting pregnant or having a healthy baby? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>Having an eating disorder can make it harder for a woman to get pregnant. It may cause early delivery, or premature birth, which can cause problems (sometimes life threatening) in a newborn. Women with eating disorders have higher rates of miscarriage than do women who don't have these disorders. If a woman doesn't eat lots of different healthy foods during pregnancy, she and her baby can have health problems. It is best to get treated for an eating disorder before you try to get pregnant. But, even if your eating disorder was treated and now gone, it could come back during the stress of pregnancy. Making sure you have good support from family, friends, and your health care provider is key to having a healthy pregnancy. Keep in mind you will also need plenty of support after the baby is born. Some women can feel "blue" or have depression after giving birth, which can make an eating disorder come back. Talk with your health care provider if you are thinking about getting pregnant or are pregnant.</FONT>
