<FONT size=3><IMG height=202 alt="Picture of a woman in a chair" src="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/Pix/anorexia_Woman.jpg" width=200 align=left> It was 6 months ago when I realized my daughter, Jen, had an eating disorder. Jen has always been a picky eater. But I started to see that she moved food around her plate. And she never ate very much. She exercised all the time — even when she was sick. And she was sick a lot. She became very skinny and pale. Her hair was thinning. Jen was moody and seemed sad — I thought that's what teens act like. But once I put the signs together, I talked to Jen about the disease anorexia. She denied the problem. But I knew she needed help. I took her to our health care provider (HCP), and she asked me to put Jen in the hospital. It's been a tough road since then — for all of us. But Jen is back home now. She is still seeing her doctors, and may need help for some time. But she is doing much better.</FONT> <H2 align=center>

</UL><H3>What causes it? </H3>
<P><FONT size=3>Anorexia nervosa is more than just a problem with food. It's a way of using food to feel in control of other feelings that may seem overwhelming. Starving is a way for people with anorexia to feel more in control of their lives and to ease tension, anger, and anxiety. While there is no single know cause of anorexia nervosa, several things may contribute to the development of the disorder: </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Families</B> . People with a mother or sister with anorexia are more likely to develop the disease. Parents who place too much value on appearance, diet themselves, and criticize their children's bodies are more likely to have a child with anorexia. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Culture</B> . The U.S. has a social and cultural ideal of extreme thinness. Women partially define themselves on how physically attractive they are. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Personal characteristics</B> . Someone with anorexia may feel badly about herself, feel helpless, and hate the way she looks. She has unrealistic expectations of herself and strives for perfection. She feels worthless, despite achievements and perceives a social pressure to be thin. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Other emotional disorders</B> . Other mental health problems, like depression or anxiety, occur along with anorexia. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Stressful events or life changes. </B>Things like starting a new school or job or being teased to traumatic events like rape can lead to the onset anorexia. </FONT>
<LI><FONT size=3><B>Biology</B> . Several biological factors including genetics, neurotransmitter regulation (neurochemicals in the brain), and other related hormones may be important to the onset the disorder. </FONT>
</UL><H3>What are signs of anorexia nervosa? </H3>

<P align=center><IMG height=535 alt="Diagram of health problems caused by anorexia" src="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/Pix/anorexia.gif" width=604> 
<P align=center>&nbsp; <H3>Can someone with anorexia nervosa get better? </H3>
<P><FONT size=3>Yes. People with this disease can get better. The treatment depends on what the person needs. The person must get back to a healthy weight. Sometimes, this means going to a hospital and staying there for treatment. Different types of health care providers, like doctors, nutritionists, and therapists, will help the patient get better. These HCPs will help the patient regain the weight, improve physical health and nutrition, learn healthy eating patterns, and cope with thoughts and feelings related to the disorder. After leaving the hospital, the patient continues to get help from her HCPs. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>But a hospital stay may not be needed. Another type of treatment program is one in which a person goes to the hospital during the day, but lives at home. Other people with anorexia can recover by getting individual counseling from an HCP, like a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Many times, eating disorders happen with other problems, like depression and anxiety problems. These problems are also treated along with the anorexia, and may involve medicines that help reduce feelings of depression and anxiety. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Family counseling and support groups may also be a part of treatment. If the patient is young, family therapy is particularly important. Support groups help patients and families talk about their experiences and help each other get better. </FONT><H3>Can women who had anorexia nervosa in the past still get pregnant? </H3>
<P><FONT size=3>It depends. Women who have fully recovered from anorexia nervosa have a better chance of getting pregnant. While a woman has anorexia nervosa, she does not get her usual period and doesn't normally ovulate. However, she may get pregnant during the weight recovery phase because her reproductive system is getting back to normal. After initial weight recovery, some women may still have irregular periods, which can lead to problems getting pregnant. Women who are continuously missing their periods should see their HCPs.</FONT> <H3>Can anorexia hurt a baby when the mother is pregnant? </H3>
<P><FONT size=3>If a woman with anorexia gets pregnant, the baby and mother can be affected. The baby is more likely to be born at a low weight and born prematurely (early). The mother is more likely to have a miscarriage, deliver by C-section, and have post partum depression.</FONT>
