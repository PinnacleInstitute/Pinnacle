<H3><A name=6>What are the treatments for eating disorders?</A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>Eating disorders can be treated and a person can return to a healthy weight. Success in treating eating disorders is greatest when they are found early and treated right away. The longer abnormal ways of eating go on, the harder it is to overcome the disorder. Plus, more damage is done to the body over time, which can result in serious health problems. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>There is no one, or best, way to treat these complex disorders. Most people with eating disorders are treated by a team of health care providers and receive medical care, psychotherapy (sometimes called "talk therapy"), and nutritional counseling. Professionals who provide psychotherapy can be therapists, <B>psychologists</B>, <B>psychiatrists</B>, </FONT><B><FONT size=3>social workers</FONT></B><FONT size=3>, or <B>counselors</B>. Types of psychotherapy include <I> cognitive-behavioral therapy</I>  (changes how a person thinks about, and then reacts to, a situation that makes them anxious or fearful) family therapy, and group therapy. In some cases, a person may need to go into the hospital or into an in-patient or residential program. Medication is also sometimes used to treat the disorder and prevent relapse (or keep it from coming back). Certain <B>antidepressants</B>, called <I> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</I>  or SSRIs, have been shown to help maintain weight and reduce anxiety for people with anorexia and bulimia. Training to build self-esteem can also be helpful. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Talk with your health care provider about treatment options. Also, look under mental health services in your local phone book or call the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, (847) 831-3438, for referrals to service providers, treatment centers, and special programs.</FONT>
