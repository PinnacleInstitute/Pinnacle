<H3><A name=3>What causes eating disorders? </A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>No one knows for sure what causes eating disorders. It is known, though, that these disorders can't be willed or wished away - treatment is needed. If you or someone you know has an eating disorder, don't wait to get help. Talk with a health care provider, the sooner the better. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Much research has been focused on how personality and environment can put a person at risk for an eating disorder. People with eating disorders are thought to share certain traits, such as low <I> self-esteem</I>  (how you feel about who you are), feelings of helplessness, and a fear of becoming overweight. Eating disorders seem to develop as a way of dealing with stress. These disorders appear to run in families, affecting women more than men. Research has shown that a woman's social environment, including her family and friends, can affect how she feels about body weight. For instance, frequent talk about being thin and dieting may put pressure on a person to be thin. Being teased about being overweight by family and friends can lead to low self-esteem and unhealthy eating in young girls and women. Also, young people who are involved in sports or activities that emphasize thinness (modeling, dancing, long distance running, gymnastics) are more likely to develop eating disorders. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Research is also looking at the role genetics and a person's biological make-up and body chemistry play in eating disorders. Studies funded by the National Institute of Mental Health have focused on <I> serotonin</I> , a substance found in the brain that can affect appetite and a person's ability to control impulses and moods. In women, researchers are exploring how eating disorders may affect serotonin levels and how the brain signals the body about hunger and fullness. For example, most women feel better - in terms of fullness and mood - after eating. But for women with anorexia, not eating can actually improve mood and feelings of well-being. Knowing how serotonin affects eating disorders will help researchers to figure out which women are more at risk for these disorders and better ways to treat them.</FONT>
