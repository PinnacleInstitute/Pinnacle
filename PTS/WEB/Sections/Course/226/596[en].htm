<H3><A name=8>What should you do if you or someone you know has an eating disorder?</A></H3>
<P><FONT size=3>Support is important when you or someone you know has an eating disorder. Tell someone you trust about your problem. It may be a family member, friend, counselor, religious or community leader, or doctor. Talking to a school counselor or mental health professional is a good place to start. Seeing a health care provider as soon as you can is important too. Your doctor can help you get the help you need for your eating disorder. You can also learn about healthier ways to eat. Don't put off seeing a doctor, thinking you will get better on your own. Keep in mind, an eating disorder can cause serious harm to your body and to your emotional health.</FONT>
