<H3 align=center><A name=QUALOCOUNS>Quality of Financial Counseling</A></H3>
<P>How successful financial counseling is depends upon three factors: the person counseling, the person counseled, and the sponsoring business, agency or organization. 
<P>How effective the counselor is depends upon her or his personal philosophy and skill in relating to the particular person or people being advised. Training, education and experience, both personal and as a counselor, also affect the counselor's effectiveness. 
<P>The person being counseled brings past and present experiences, values, attitudes and skills to the counseling experience. All these factors impact on the success of counseling. 
<P>Finally, the counselor's sponsoring agency, organization or business affects the success of counseling. Every sponsor of a financial counseling program has a philosophy related to that program. 
<P>For example, some programs are more consumer-oriented than creditor-oriented, or vice versa. Sponsoring entities may focus on short-term solutions rather than on long-term education to help clients learn new attitudes and behaviors related to money management.
