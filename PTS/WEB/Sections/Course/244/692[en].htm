<H3 align=center><A name=WHYFC>Why is Financial Counseling Needed?</A></H3>
<P>Often there is more than one reason to seek financial counseling. Many people lack the knowledge and skills necessary for successful financial management. 
<P>Personal financial management is generally not part of our education; most of us learn to manage finances through the school of "hard knocks" or personal experience, and from observation of how others manage money. 
<P>There are four financial reasons that motivate people to seek help. First are income-related problems, including unemployment, layoffs, underemployment, illness or accident, family abandonment, retirement, death, divorce, and irregular income. 
<P>Expense problems are the second of the four financial reasons to solicit financial advice. Expense problems include the lack of a financial "cushion" to help during an emergency, unplanned increases in regular and irregular expenses, and change in a person's or family's situation. Such changes include divorce, a new family member, a new home, or a different job for a breadwinner. 
<P>The third financial reason is credit use or general debt management. Using credit as an alternative source of income, setting up housekeeping, impulsive/compulsive spending, lack of sales resistance, and uninsured property loss are some of the credit-related reasons people want financial counseling. 
<P>The fourth reason to seek financial counseling is that society is more complex. We face a greater number of alternatives and choices when making financial decisions, and we seek help with financial decisionmaking. 
<P>Now that we have discussed what financial counseling is, who needs it, when and why, we should consider how to judge a financial counselor, and where to find a financial counseling service. Remember, there are no legal restrictions on using the title "financial counselor." Anyone can claim that title.
