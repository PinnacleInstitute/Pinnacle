<H3 align=center><A name=CHARAOCOUNS>Characteristics of a Qualified Financial Counselor</A></H3>A qualified financial counselor has: 
<UL>
<LI>a genuine concern for people. The counselor enjoys working with people. 
<LI>a tolerance for points-of-view, values, and goals unlike the counselor's own. 
<LI>a way of recognizing and working to preserve the dignity and self-respect of other people. 
<LI>a personality and manner that encourages other people to open up. 
<LI>an openness about self, but enough self-respect to maintain personal privacy. 
<LI>a commitment to objectivity. Qualified counselors see their roll as problem-solvers and alternative-generators, but not as decision-makers. 
<LI>the ability to listen. Qualified counselors know the value of, and practice, appropriate silence. 
<LI>optimism. The counselor believes people basically are good, and can and will exercise at least some control over their own destinies. 
<LI>the know-how to look for the real problem, since money problems often are symptoms of other difficulties. The counselor refers people for appropriate help with personal, marital, chemical abuse, and other malfunctions a financial counselor may not be qualified to deal with. 
<LI>insight into the counselor's own biases and attitudes. The counselor takes conscious steps to prevent these biases and attitudes from interfering with effective financial counseling. 
<LI>the ability to recognize, and help the client recognize, that the final decision and solution to financial difficulties rests on his/her/their shoulders. The final solution is not the responsibility, success or failure of the counselor, but of the client.
