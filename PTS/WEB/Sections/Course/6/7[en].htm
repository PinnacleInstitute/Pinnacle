<FONT face="MS Sans Serif">What hardware and software will you need? Well the good news is that creating a Web page is cheap and easy. </FONT>
<P>I know you are all anxious to get started, so lets gather the tools we will use. Here is what you need: 
<P><B>Text editor</B>
<BR>HTML documents must contain nothing more than letters, numbers, spaces, punctuation marks, carriage returns, and HTML tags describing how the rest of the text should look. Although an HTML document can contain tags that describe web page content, they cannot contain text that has actually BEEN formatted. For that reason, it is NOT a good idea to create an HTML document with a word processor, such as Word or WordPerfect. 
<P>The problem with most word processors is that they save more than just your page content and HTML tags. When you save your work in a typical word processor, the margins, font, text height, tab settings, printer make, text color, and numerous other settings are saved along with the document. This file is a Word or WordPerfect document, not an HTML file. This extra information will show up on your Web page as funny looking letters, symbols and boxes. To avoid this Web page clutter always save your file as "text only" files. 
<P>Because the documents produced in a text editors (such as Windows' Notepad or Macintosh's SimpleText) can be read on any platform, they generally offer the safest environment for creating platform-independent HTML documents. 
<P><B>Web Browser</B>
<BR>A Web browser is a software application that allows your local computer to communicate with Web Servers connected to the Internet. Popular browsers include Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator. Once you create your code you will need a Web Browser to view the files, and to allow you to connect to the Internet. I recommend Netscape Communicator or Internet Explorer version 4 or higher. These are available as a free download at the Netscape and Microsoft web sites. 
<P><B>Connection to the Internet</B>
<BR>It is not necessary for you to purchase and install your very own Web Server in order to distribute information via the World Wide Web. Most folks simply rent space on an existing Web server. I will be discussing free Web servers which you may want tto explore as you participate in the class.
