<FONT face="MS Sans Serif">Lets align text, move it away from the left or right margins, and format with <B>bold</B>, <I>italic </I>or <U>underline</U>. </FONT>
<P><B>Step 1 - Aligning text using the &lt;P&gt; and the "align" attribute</B>
<BR>If you enter <B>&lt;p align=right&gt;</B> instead of the traditional &lt;p&gt;tag, then the text that follows aligns along the right hand side of the page. 
<P>Lets include this tag after the final &lt;hr /&gt; tag and above the Corporate Headquarters information <B>&lt;p align=right&gt; </B>&lt;FONT SIZE="2"&gt;Corporate Headquarters: 
<P>When I view the page the contact information will align to the right until I type in the &lt;/p&gt; tag. 
<P><B>Step 2 - Aligning the &lt;hr /&gt; tag.</B>
<BR>Add align=right to each of the &lt;hr /&gt; tags and they will align to the right as well. 
<P><B>&lt;hr align=right width=60% /&gt;</B> 
<P><B>Step 3 - Centering Text</B>
<BR>The <B>&lt;center&gt;</B> tag will cause whatever follows to be centered in the next line in the page. To end centering close with the <B>&lt;/center&gt; </B>tag. For example:
<BR><B>&lt;center&gt; </B>This text is centered <B>&lt;/center&gt; </B>will appear as: 
<BR>
<BR><CENTER>This text is centered </CENTER>
<P>Another way to achieve centering is to include the align=center attribute in the p tag. This code will cause the text that follows to be aligned in the center of the screen. <B>&lt;p align=center&gt;</B> 
<P><FONT face=arial>I have not included centered text in my sample website. 
<P><B>Step 4 - Creating an Indented Paragraph</B>
<BR>You can indent a text on both sides by surrounding it with the &lt;blockquote&gt; ... &lt;/blockquote&gt; tags. 
<P>The &lt;blockquote&gt; and &lt;/blockquote&gt; tags mark the beginning and end of a paragraph that will be indented about one-half inch on both the left and right sides. 
<P>I enter <B>&lt;blockquote&gt;</B> at the top of the page 
<P>and then type <B>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</B> at the end 
<P>NOTE: For even more indentation, it is possible to surround your paragraphs with two or more &lt;blockquote&gt; tags, like this: 
<P>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; This paragraph is going to be indented quite a bit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
<P>There is no limit to the number of blockquote tags you can use. Just remember to turn off each &lt;blockquote&gt; at the end of the indented paragraph. 
<P><B>Step 5 Adding Bold, Italic or Underline </B>
<BR>Emphasizing one or more of the words in your document is fairly simple. The HTML language contains a number of tags that you can use to change the appearance of your text. Here are a few important tags: 
<P><B>&lt;B&gt; ... &lt;/B&gt;</B> can be used to make your text bold
<BR><B>&lt;I&gt; ... &lt;/I&gt;</B> can be used to italicize your text
<BR><B>&lt;U&gt; ... &lt;/U&gt;</B> can be used to underline your text 
<P>Your document should now look like this: 
<P>&lt;HTML&gt;

<BR>&lt;META name="description" content=" FunnyFakeFish.com has the perfect gag gift for your family and co-workers. Humorous, witty, fake fish produces a joke of the day. Provides fun, laughter, and surprises"/&gt;

<BR>&lt;FONT COLOR="#993300"&gt; move over Pet Rock...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; there's a new Pet in town&lt;/FONT&gt; 
<BR>&lt;P&gt;
<BR>This is a <B>&lt;i&gt;fictitious&lt;/i&gt;</B> website created as a learning tool for my students. The subject of the web project was chosen because I enjoy creating websites and my husband enjoys fish. I buy computers and software, he buys live rock, filters, pumps, and corals. Our mission is to raise money thru online courses and educational materials so that he can have a 500 gallon tank and I can have a flat panel display.
