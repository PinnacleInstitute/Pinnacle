<P>Every site on the Web is clamoring for your attention. What makes some sites effective and attractive while others are frustrating and annoying?. 
<P>It all comes down to planning. I'm sure you will agree that the very definition of an effective Web site is one that meets the needs of its visitors. This concept is not new, customer service is a basic business principle. However, we can all cite dozens of Web sites that failed to deliver the information we went there to find. Usually these sites have failed because of poor planning. 
<P>Before writing a single line of HTML, a skilled Web site developer will take out a pencil and paper to develop a plan. To be effective, this plan must provide answers to the following questions: 
<P>Question One: Who? 
<BR>Question Two: Why? 
<BR>Question Three: What?
<BR>Question Four: Where?
<BR>Question Five: How? 
<P>Let's tackle each of these questions in detail: 
<P>Question One: Who? 
<P>Describe your target audience. Be as specific as possible. "Computer professionals who want to update their skills." is better than "students." This specificity is very important. Your answers to the next four questions in the planning process will depend on your answer to this question. 
<P>Now it's time to generalize. Try to identify some common characteristics of your target audience. As you search for commonalities, look at education levels, religious beliefs, concerns, activities, tastes, hobbies, political philosophies, career paths, aspirations... the list is endless. 
<P>Based on what you have discovered about your target audience, try to imagine a typical member of this audience. Give him or her a name and a background, as if you were creating a character for a novel. Try to imagine what might attract him or her to your Web site. Think of the types of information this person would want to see when he or she reaches your Web site. 
<P>Take a moment to consider the hardware and software your typical visitor will be using. What type of computer, operating system, browser, screen, Internet connection, and computer expertise will your target market possess? 
<BR>
<BR>Question Two: Why? 
<P>Now it's time to define the purpose of your Web site. Answer this question: Why is your Web site needed? A Web site without a clear mission is likely to leave your visitors confused and feeling like they've wasted their time. Keep it simple- try to summarize your Web site's purpose in one sentence , if possible. 
<P>
<BR>-Question Three: What?- 
<P>You should now be ready to define exactly what you will be placing on your Web site. To do so, construct a list of the specific pieces of information you will make available to your visitors in order to meet the broad objectives outlined in the previous question. On this list, identify the source of each piece of information. Also, determine which items on the list will need to be updated periodically and construct a schedule. 
<P>Also indicate if this information already exists (in the form of a brochure or catalog), or if new content will need to be created specifically for your Web site. 
<BR>Question Four: Where? 
<P>You need to define the structure of your Web site. Where will you place all of the pieces of information you specified in your answer to the last question? How will the information be physically arranged? 
<P>As you compose your answer to this final question, remember this: one of the most important things to consider as you define the physical layout of your Web site is how long it will take your visitor to retrieve each page of information. 
<P>Multiple images, large images, or extremely long pages will lead to long retrieval times. Web surfers are notorious for their impatience. No matter how beautiful or informative, a Web page that takes too long to load won't get seen if your visitor tires of waiting and moves on to another site. To avoid the long delays that can send potential visitors running, try to avoid placing all of your information on one page. 
<P>Instead, break up the information, distributing it across multiple, interrelated pages. 
<P>
<BR>Question Five: How? 
<P>Who will create your Web site and how will it be maintained? Hopefully most of the pages you can do yourself, that may be why you are enrolled in this class. In addition there may be portions of the site such as a secure shopping cart or online chat room which you will need to hire a programmer to produce. As you build your site consider how much time you will have for maintenance. Every page which has time sensitive information will need to be updated on a regular basis. Start small so you don't become overwhelmed. 
<P>
<BR>Some other important points: 
<P>As you develop each of these pages, understand that the World Wide Web is porous. A visitor could stumble onto any page of your Web site. Make sure that each page can function as a self-contained unit, with information about your organization, the purpose of the page, and links to other pages on your Web site. 
<P>-Make sure each page you create for one Web site looks like the others. If you place navigational aids (buttons or hypertext links) on one page, be sure and duplicate these links on other pages so as not to leave your visitor stranded. The pages on your Web site should leave the visitor with an impression of coherence and unity. 
<P>-As you lay out the text and graphics, try to select an arrangement that is balanced and aesthetically pleasing. We will be focusing on this topic for the remaining five weeks of this class.
