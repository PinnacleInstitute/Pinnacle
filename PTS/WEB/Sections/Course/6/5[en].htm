<p>
	This new and exciting technology has also brought with it a new terminology. Whether you aspire to a career as a Web developer or plan on using the Internet as an online storefront, you need to be able to sling the &quot;lingo&quot; with other Web professionals.</p>
<p>
	Lets begin with all the &quot;Web Words&quot;</p>
<p>
	<b>Web Page</b> <br />
	A Web page is a combination of words and images that has been formatted for display on a computer monitor.</p>
<p>
	<b>Web site</b> <br />
	A collection of Web pages stored in a specific location on the World Wide Web. Each Web site contains a home page (usually named &quot;index.html&quot;, which is the first document users see when they enter the site. The site might also contain additional documents and files including graphics, audio, video, cgi scripts, and databases.</p>
<p>
	<b>Webmaster </b><br />
	An individual who manages a Web site. Depending on the size of the site, the Webmaster might be responsible for any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Making sure that the Web server hardware and software are running properly</li>
	<li>
		Designing the Web site</li>
	<li>
		Creating and updating Web pages</li>
	<li>
		Replying to user feedback</li>
	<li>
		Creating CGI scripts</li>
	<li>
		Monitoring traffic through the site</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The exponential growth of the World Wide Web has created an unprecedented demand for Webmasters. There may be several aspiring Webmasters enrolled in this course.</p>
<p>
	<b>World Wide Web </b><br />
	Also known as the WWW, the W3, or most often simply as the Web, it originally developed by CERN labs in Geneva, Switzerland. Continuing development of the Web is overseen by the World Wide Web Consortium.</p>
<p>
	<b>Internet </b><br />
	The Internet originated in 1969, in the midst of the Cold War, as a &quot;nuke-proof&quot; communications network. It consists of countless networks and computers across the world that allow millions of people to share information. The lines that carry the majority of the information are know as the Internet backbone. While the government used to run things, now major Internet service providers (ISPs) such as MCI, GTE, Sprint, UUNET, and ANS own portions of the backbone- a good thing as they have the motivation and the revenue to maintain the quality of these large networks.</p>
<p>
	<b>URL</b> <br />
	uniform resource locator <br />
	URLs are the Internet equivalent of mailing addresses. How do they work? Like other types of addresses, they move from the general to the specific (from zip code to recipient, so to speak). Take this URL, for example: <br />
	http://www.sonic.net/~webclass/video</p>
<p>
	First you have the protocol: <br />
	http:/</p>
<p>
	then the server address or domain: <br />
	/www.sonic.net</p>
<p>
	and finally the directory: <br />
	~webclass/video/</p>
<p>
	Note - there is no specific file included in this URL. If a file called index.html resides in the video directory it will automatically be opened when the URL is accessed..</p>
<p>
	Is URL pronounced &quot;you are ell,&quot; or does it rhyme with hurl? Both pronunciations are widely used.</p>
<p>
	<b>Domain Name </b><br />
	Looking for a domain name? You&#39;ll find it to the right of the @ sign in an email address, or about ten characters into a URL. Our Web site&#39;s domain name is <!-><br />
	www.sonic.net.
	<p>
		Domain names are issued by the National Science Foundation (NSF). They assign different extensions based on whether the domain belongs to a <br />
		commercial enterprise (.com) <br />
		educational establishment (.edu) <br />
		government body (.gov), <br />
		the military (.mil) <br />
		a network (.net) <br />
		nonprofit organization (.org).</p>
