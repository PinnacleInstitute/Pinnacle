<FONT face="MS Sans Serif">A heading tag controls the shape and formatting of text. Use these tags to identify the major sections of your text. </FONT>
<P>A "heading" is not the same thing as the tag, although it sounds similar. A "heading" is essentially oversized text, used primarily to identify different sections of the document's content. 
<P>You are allowed to use six levels of headings in HTML. Each of the six heading levels is numbered (from &lt;H1&gt; ... &lt;/H1&gt; through &lt;H6&gt; ... &lt;/H6&gt; ). 
<P>&lt;H1&gt; produces the largest text and &lt;H6&gt; the smallest. All heading text is displayed as bold text. In addition a blank line is inserted above and below the heading. 
<P>Let's apply the &lt;H1&gt; heading to the Company Name: 
<P><B>Step 1 - Applying a Heading Tag</B>
<BR>Insert the &lt;H1&gt; tag before "FunnyFakeFish.com" then end the tag using &lt;/H1&gt; 
<P>Your document should now look something like this: 
<P>- - - - - - code snippet from index.html file - - - - - - - 
<P>&lt;BODY&gt;
<BR><B>&lt;H1&gt;"FunnyFakeFish.com" &lt;/H1&gt;</B>
<BR>move over Pet Rock...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;there's a new Pet in town 
<BR>&lt;P&gt;
<BR>This is a fictitious website created as a learning tool for my students. The subject of the web project was chosen because I enjoy creating websites and my husband enjoys fish. I buy computers and software, he buys live rock, filters, pumps, and corals. Our mission is to raise money thru online courses and educational materials so that he can have a 500 gallon tank and I can have a flat panel display.
<BR>&lt;/P&gt; 
<P>- - - - - - end of code snippet - - - - - - - 
<P>You may want to experiment with all the heading sizes. Here is how they look.
