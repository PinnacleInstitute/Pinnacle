<P>In this lesson you will evaluate the sites of my former students at Santa Rosa Junior College. By reviewing existing Web sites you can begin to gain ideas for your own site. 
<P>  
<P><B>Beginning Projects</B>: 
<BR>These sites were created by students who enrolled in my HTML series of courses. They also had a good eye for color and design. If you complete HTML 1, 2, and 3, you will have learned enough to create sites like these. 
<P><A href="http://www.sonic.net/%7Ebhrlthr/bhrphoto/index.html" target=_blank>Photography site - Bruce Robinsons</A> 
<BR>Black and White can be very effective on the screen. This site uses a very simple layout so the images can shine through. The red accent color adds visual interest. I appreciated that Bruce uses thumbnails which link to larger versions of the photos. This makes the pages load more quickly and allows me to browse the images quickly.

<P><A href="http://www.sonic.net/%7Elynnbell/" target=_blank>Monroe Street Studios</A> - Lynn Bell 
<BR>Lynn has a strong sense of color, line and design. She has extensive experience in desktop publishing and has been able to translate her designs to the screen. If you would like to create an online portfolio this is an excellent model. 
<P><B>Advanced Projects:</B> 
<BR>These sites were designed for nonprofit agencies in Sonoma County. The students work in teams to build sites for "real clients". These sites are more complex since the students had been trained in Web Graphic Design and Web programming.
