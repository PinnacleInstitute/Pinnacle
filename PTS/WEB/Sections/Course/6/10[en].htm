<FONT face="MS Sans Serif">Okay, enough talking. Time to roll up your sleeves and get busy creating your first Web page. In just a few moments, you're going to build a Web page! Ready? </FONT>
<P><B>Step 1 - Start Your Text Editor</B>
<BR>Windows 98/2000 use 'Notepad'
<BR>Macintosh use 'Simple Text' 
<P><B>Step 2 - Type the first HTML tag</B>
<BR>The first tag you type in an HTML document is a tag which identifies the language you are using. This tag consists of the letters HTML surrounded by angle brackets. 
<BR><B>&lt;HTML&gt;</B> 
<P>**Note: HTML (the language) is NOT case-sensitive. You can write the tag above as &lt;HTML&gt; or &lt;html&gt; or &lt;HtmL&gt; and it will work just fine. If later on you learn XML, this language IS case sensitive. 
<P><B>Step 3 - Create the Document Header</B>
<BR>Below the &lt;HTML&gt; tag type a <B>&lt;HEAD&gt;</B> tag 
<P>The &lt;HEAD&gt; is a crucial section of your document since it contains the document title and information that will help Internet search engines catalog your document correctly. 
<P><B>Step 4 - Title Tag</B>
<BR>Every HTML document needs a one-line title. This title will show up in the title bar at the top of any browser that displays your document. This should describe the content of the page. It should be descriptive, but less than 64 characters. Bookmarks/Favorites display your page title. 
<P>An example of a poor title would be "Fish Site". A better title would be "Funny Fake Fish Gag Gifts and Novelty Items". 
<P>On the line below your &lt;HEAD&gt; tag type <B>&lt;TITLE&gt;</B> , which is the tag we use to mark the beginning of your page title, and search engines use it to catalog your site. On the same line, make up and type a title for your HTML document. At the end of your title, type the<B> &lt;/TITLE&gt;</B> tag to indicate that you have reached the end of the title. Don't forget to type the slash ( / ) inside of this tag. 
<P><B>Step 5 - Meta Tag Description</B>
<BR>On the line immediately below your title, type the following tag (substituting your own content for the sentences I typed). 
<P>&lt;META name="description" content="Write a description of your page between the quotes here. Try to use less than 250 characters, if you can. Make sure and finish up with a quote mark and an angle bracket. <FONT size=5>/</FONT> "&gt; 
<P>Notice how this tag does not have an end tag. It is a "stand-alone tag which is completely self contained. HTML allows these tags to contain opening tags, but not closing tags. XML requires that a standalone tag have an ending /. I have exaggerated the size of the slash in the example above to make it easy to spot. 
<P>Also, the "name" attribute is assigned a value of "description". Do not type anything other than the word "description". Please note that the word "description" should be surrounded by double quote marks. You are free to write whatever you want as the value of "content" 
<P>One double quote mark should appear at the beginning of the content, and another double quote mark should appear at the end. However, you cannot have any double quote marks in between those two. 
<P>Your web page should now look something like this: 
<P>&lt;HTML&gt;
<BR>&lt;HEAD&gt;
<BR>&lt;TITLE&gt;Funny Fake Fish for Home or Office &lt;/TITLE&gt; 
<BR><B>&lt;META name="description" content="FunnyFakeFish.com has the perfect gag gift for your family and co-workers. Humorous, witty, fake fish produces a joke of the day. Provides fun, laughter, and surprises" /&gt;</B>
<BR>&lt;/HEAD&gt; 
<P><B>Step 6 - Body Tag</B>
<BR>The actual contents of your web page is displayed in the &lt;BODY&gt; of the HTML document. As soon as you finish typing the &lt;/HEAD&gt;, you must immediately enter the <B>&lt;BODY&gt;</B> tag. 
<P><B>Step 7 - Enter some Text</B>
<BR>Finally we can begin to discuss content. I eagerly type in 3 text blocks: the Company Name, a descriptive paragraph, and the corporate address. 
<P>FunnyFakeFish.com 
<P>This is a fictitious web site created as a learning tool for my students. The subject of the web project was chosen because I enjoy creating web sites and my husband enjoys fish. I buy computers and software; he buys live rock, filters, pumps, and corals. Our mission is to raise money thru online courses and educational materials so that he can have a 500 gallon tank and I can have a flat panel display.

<BR>(800) 123-4567 
<P><B>Step 8 - Close the Body</B>
<BR>Type <B>&lt;/BODY&gt;</B> 
<P><B>Step 9 - Close the Document</B>
<BR>Type <B>&lt;/HTML&gt;</B>
<BR>You're done! 
<P>Your finished document should now look something like this: 
<P>&lt;HTML&gt;
<BR>&lt;HEAD&gt;
<BR>&lt;TITLE&gt;Funny Fake Fish for Home or Office &lt;/TITLE&gt; 
<BR>&lt;META name="description" content=" FunnyFakeFish.com has the perfect gag gift for your family and co-workers. Humorous, witty, fake fish produces a joke of the day. Provides fun, laughter, and surprises" /&gt;

<BR>&lt;/HTML&gt; 
<P><B>Step 10 - Save your Work</B>
<BR>Now it's time to save your HTML document. All HTML documents must have an ".html" extension and MUST be saved in "text" format. 
<P>Let's give it a try. Click the FILE menu&gt; SAVE AS&gt; in the FILENAME box, you must type <B>index.html</B> Please note, sometimes Notepad adds a .txt extension to your file, to avoid this place "" around the name to force the .html extension. 
<P>After typing the file name and extension, please select a drive and/or directory for your file. 
<P>Click the OK (or SAVE) button to save your work. 
<P>If you plan to continue working leave your text editor open. 
<P><B>Step 11 - View Your Web Page</B>
<BR>Launch your Web Browser and select FILE&gt; OPEN or OPEN PAGE IN NAVIGATOR. Each browser and platform may have a different menu selection. Locate your index.html file and open it. Yippee - there it is! 
<P>Remember, I typed 3 distinctive text blocks: the company name, a short description, and the corporate address. Does it look a little funny to you? It all lumped together didn't it. Don't despair, the next lesson on returns and spaces will solve the problem.
