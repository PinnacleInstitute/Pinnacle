<P align=center><U><B><FONT size=4>DO'S</FONT></B></U> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>1.&nbsp; Increase your knowledge about eating disorders (request information packets, read books, attend seminars).</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>2.&nbsp; Talk with the person about your concerns in a loving and supportive way.&nbsp; It is important to discuss these issues with honesty and respect.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>3.&nbsp; Talk with the person at an appropriate time and place - in private, free from distractions.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>4.&nbsp; Encourage the person to seek professional help as soon as possible.&nbsp; Suggest that she/he see someone who specializes in eating disorders (a physician, therapist or dietician).</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>5.&nbsp; Be prepared that the person may deny that she/he has a problem.&nbsp; If so, and if she/he refuses to get help, it will be important to tell someone else about your concerns.&nbsp; If your friend is under 18, her/his parents need to know immediately.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>6.&nbsp; Listen with a nonjudgmental ear.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>7.&nbsp; Talk about things other than food, weight, and exercise.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>8.&nbsp; Be available when your friend needs someone, but remember, it is okay to set limits on what you can and cannot do.</FONT> 
<P align=left><FONT size=3>9.&nbsp; Hang in there!&nbsp; It won't be easy.</FONT> 
<P align=center><U><B><FONT size=4>DON'TS</FONT></B></U> 
<P><FONT size=3>1.&nbsp; Don't try to solve her/his problems or help with the eating disorder on your own.&nbsp; Get help from others.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3>3.&nbsp; Don't talk about weight, food, calories, or appearance.&nbsp; Do not make any comments on what she/he looks like.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>4.&nbsp; Don't try to force or encourage your friend to eat.&nbsp; Do not get into power struggles.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>5.&nbsp; Don't let her/his peculiarities dominate you or manipulate you.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>6.&nbsp; Don't gossip about her/him to others.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>7.&nbsp; Don't be scared to talk with her/him.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>8.&nbsp; Don't expect to be the perfect friend - Reach out for support when you need it.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>9.&nbsp; Don't expect your friend to be "cured" after treatment.&nbsp; Recovery can be a long process.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>10. Don't keep this a secret for your friend.&nbsp; Remember, her/his life may be in danger.</FONT></FONT></TD>
