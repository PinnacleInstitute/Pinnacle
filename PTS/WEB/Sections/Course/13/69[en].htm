<LI>A <B>database</B> is a collection of related information. 
<LI>An <B>object</B> is a competition in the database such as a table, query, form, or macro. 
<LI>A <B>table</B> is a grouping of related data organized in fields (columns) and records (rows) on a datasheet. By using a common field in two tables, the data can be combined. Many tables can be stored in a single database. 
<LI>A <B>field</B> is a column on a datasheet and defines a data type for a set of values in a table. For a mailing list table might include fields for first name, last name, address, city, state, zip code, and telephone number. 
<LI>A <B>record</B> in a row on a datasheet and is a set of values defined by fields. In a mailing list table, each record would contain the data for one person as specified by the intersecting fields. 
<LI><B>Design View</B> provides the tools for creating fields in a table. 
<LI><B>Datasheet View</B> allows you to update, edit, and delete in formation from a table.

<P><B>Blank Access database</B> 
<OL>
<LI>Unlike Word documents, Excel worksheets, and Power Point presentations, you must save an Access database before you start working on it. After selecting "Blank Access database", you will first be prompted to specify a location and name for the database.
