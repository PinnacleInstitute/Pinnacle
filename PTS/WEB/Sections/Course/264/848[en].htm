<P><FONT color=#000000>The 504 Certified Development Company Program enables growing businesses to secure long-term, fixed-rate financing for major fixed assets, such as land and buildings. A certified development company is a nonprofit corpo- ration set up to contribute to the economic development of its community or region. CDCs work with the SBA and private-sector lenders to provide financing to small businesses. There are about 290 CDCs nationwide. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The program is designed to enable small businesses to create and retain jobs; the CDC's portfolio must create or retain one job for every $35,000 of debenture proceeds provided by the SBA. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Typically, a 504 project includes -  </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT color=#000000>a loan secured with a senior lien from a private-sector lender covering up to 50 percent of the project cost, </FONT>
<LI><FONT color=#000000>a second loan secured with a junior lien from the CDC (a 100 percent SBA-guaranteed debenture) covering up to 40 percent of the project cost, and </FONT>
<LI><FONT color=#000000>a contribution of at least 10 percent equity by the borrower. </FONT>
</UL>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The maximum SBA debenture generally is $750,000 (up to $1 million in some cases). </FONT>
<P><B><FONT color=#000000>Use of Proceeds </FONT></B>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Proceeds from 504 loans must be used for fixed-asset projects such as -  </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT color=#000000>purchasing land and improvements, including existing buildings, grading, street improvements, utilities, parking lots and landscaping; </FONT>
<LI><FONT color=#000000>construction, modernizing, renovating or converting existing facilities; and </FONT>
<LI><FONT color=#000000>purchasing machinery and equipment. </FONT>
</UL>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The 504 Program cannot be used for working capital or inventory, consolidating or repaying debt, or most refinancing. </FONT>
<P><B><FONT color=#000000>Terms, Interest Rates and Fees </FONT></B>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Interest rates on 504 loans are based on the current market rate for five-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury issues plus an increment above the Treasury rate, based on market conditions. Only maturities of 10 and 20 years are available. Fees total approximately 3 percent of the debenture and may be financed with the loan. </FONT>
<P><B><FONT color=#000000>Collateral </FONT></B>
<P><FONT color=#000000>Generally the project assets being financed are used as collateral. Personal guaranties of the principal owners are also required. </FONT>
<P><B><FONT color=#000000>Eligibility </FONT></B>
<P><FONT color=#000000>To be eligible, the business generally must be operated for profit and fall within the size standards set by the SBA. Under the 504 Program, a business qualifies as small if it does not have a tangible net worth in excess of $6 million and does not have an average net income in excess of $2 million after taxes for the preceding two years, or if it meets standard 7(a) criteria. Loans cannot be made to businesses engaged in speculation or investment.</FONT>
