<P><FONT color=#000000>The Export Working Capital Program was developed in response to the needs of exporters seeking short-term working capital. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The SBA guarantees 90 percent of the principal and interest, up to $750,000. The EWCP uses a one-page application form and streamlined documentation, and turnaround is usually within 10 days. You may also apply for a letter of prequalification from the SBA. </FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000000>You may have other current SBA guaranties, as long as the SBA's exposure does not exceed $750,000 for all of your loans. When an EWCP loan is com- bined with an international trade loan, the SBA's exposure can go up to $1.25 million. </FONT>

<P><FONT color=#000000>Typically, EWCP loan maturities either match a single transaction cycle or support a line of credit, generally with a term of 12 months. Unlike other 7(a) programs, interest rates and fees are negotiated between you and your lender. The SBA charges the lender a nominal guaranty fee, which may be passed on to you.</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;
