<P><FONT color=#000000>LowDoc is one of the SBA's most popular programs. Once you have met your lender's requirements for credit, LowDoc offers a simple, one-page SBA application form and rapid turnaround on approvals for loans of up to $100,000 (for loans over $50,000, you must also provide a copy of U.S. Income Tax Schedule C or the front page of the corporate or partnership returns for the past three years). The SBA will guarantee up to 80 percent of the loan amount. Completed applications are processed quickly by the SBA, usually within two or three days. Proceeds may not be used to repay certain types of existing debt. </FONT>
