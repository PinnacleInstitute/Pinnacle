<H3>SBA Customer-Service Standards</H3>
<P>As one of the first initiatives of this administration, President Clinton and Vice President Gore challenged us to "reinvent" the SBA, to create an agency that not only works better, but is smaller and costs less. The best possible customer service is a key element of reinventing government, and we at the SBA are committed to providing quality service at all our service delivery points and to all our customers - small businesses, lenders and resource partners, among others. We are establishing "benchmarks" from the best of the business community and applying these standards to our programs, monitoring our success and eliciting regular feedback from our customers on our performance. 
<P>Specifically, we are committed to the following principles:
<OL>
<LI>We will provide prompt, courteous and accurate responses to requests for information received by telephone, in writing or in person. 
<LI>We will continue to look for cost-effective and user-friendly ways to make information easily accessible to the small business community. 
<LI>We will continue to streamline and reinvent processes to make conducting business with the SBA easier for both our resource partners and small business owners. 
<LI>We will provide the small business owner with specialized technical assistance through a variety of programs in a variety of locations. 
<LI>We will continue to work to relieve the regulatory burden on small business. 
<LI>We will continue to facilitate and strengthen working relationships between small contractors and federal procuring agencies.
