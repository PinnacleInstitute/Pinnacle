<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>During the session, Shirley's soulful, clear and gentle voice will assist you to go deep within yourself into the meditative state. There you can receive insights and release the fears or blockages that prevent you from listening to your intuition. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The class offers new exercises in addition to those in the book and will assist in taking the next steps on the path to <I>no fear</I>! It moves the abstract concept of coming to trust into the day to day realm of our own lives. You can use the meditations later on your own. You'll find that you'll expand on what you've been exposed to. As you begin to trust your intuition more, you'll "go with the flow" during your meditations. You'll find yourself listening to this audio over and over again, as each time you'll gain new insight. </FONT>
