can email Sales Presentations to people that you've attracted
personally and who are not in your Sales Management System as a
prospect.&nbsp; If they are already in the system from a Lead Page,
you will send them a Sales Presentation from their detail prospect
record.&nbsp; You will learn how to do this later in the Sales
Management lesson.</font></p>

the "Send to a Friend" icon <img src="Images/Support/email.gif" border="0" height="16" width="16"> will allow

Take care to not modify the special tags like {p-firstname}, which will
be replaced with the person's first name when the email is
sent.&nbsp; Also make sure you don't make any changes to the link
in the email message.&nbsp; The link will contain specific
information identifying this Sales Presentation, your member number and
the prospect's number.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial" size="3">Your personal email signature
is automatically inserted in the email message.&nbsp; After you
enter up to ten names and email addresses following the email message,
you can also specify multiple keywords at the bottom of the
page.&nbsp; The keywords will be stored in each new prospect's
description field for which you can search later.&nbsp; This is
handy for tracking the source of the new prospect, like a networking
meeting or a seminar.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#000000" face="Arial">You can use the WYSIWYG
(What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) Editor to apply formatting similar to a

new system strictly prohibits all spamming activities.&nbsp;
Spamming is the sending of any&nbsp; unsolicited emails.&nbsp;
Besides being illegal, spamming is highly ineffective and it gives the
false hope that you don't have to do anything.&nbsp; Your most
important job is to build relationships with people, don't attempt to
have technology replace your relationship building.</font></p>

system tracks the dates and times when the prospect views the Sales
Presentation and how many times they view it.&nbsp; The system also

prospect may be sent multiple Sales Presentations over time if
