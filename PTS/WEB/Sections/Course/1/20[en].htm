						<font face="Arial" size="3">Your Sales Management System includes several Sales Reports to help you monitor your sales&nbsp; success by measuring how effectively you are filling your sales pipeline, moving your prospects through your sales pipeline, and moving your prospects out of your sales pipeline by disqualifying them or converting them into customers.</font></p>
					<p align="left">
						<font face="Arial" size="3">The Sales System menu in the upper-right corner of the page includes a Reports section to access your Sales Reports.</font></p>

						<font face="Arial" size="4">Sales Board</font></p>
					<p>
						<font face="Arial" size="3">A traditional sales department had a large white board or chalk board mounted on the wall that displayed all the active deals the salespeople were working on and what the status of each deal was.&nbsp; It provided a simple summary for management to monitor the status of the sales department.</font></p>
					<p>
						<font face="Arial" size="3">Your personal Sales Board provides a summary of all your active prospects for the selected Sales Campaign at the top of the page.&nbsp; Your Sales Board is sometimes referred to as your sales pipeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p>
						<font face="Arial" size="3">Your Sales Board displays all the sales statuses for the selected sales campaign with the total prospects per status and their potential and current value.&nbsp; The current value is calculated from the entered potential value for each prospect </font><font face="Arial" size="3">and their current status in the sales cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
					<p>
						<font face="Arial" size="3">The Sales Campaign defines a conversion rate for each sales status.&nbsp; For example, the "Retail" sales campaign below has three statuses with conversion rates of 20%, 50% and 90%.&nbsp; It assumes that on average you will close 2 out of 10 prospects that make it to the Qualify status, 5 out of 10 that make it to the Evaluate status, and 9 out of 10 that make it to the Commit status.&nbsp; </font></p>
