&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally, the concept of accelerated learning incorporates hands-on experiences with positive reinforcement of the natural learning abilities of every individual. It's a system derived from detailed studies of the human mind and how it acquires knowledge, with consideration for Dr. Lozanov's conclusions that learning is enhanced when tension, stress, and preconceptions are removed. Lozanov believed that powerful learning must engage both the analytical brain and the emotional brain, along with both states of mind-the conscious and the unconscious. Based on these principles, IAL focuses on the application and expansion of the following:&nbsp;

<TD vAlign=top width="70%"><B><FONT color=#009966>The Role of Music and the Arts</FONT></B>&nbsp;
<BR>Because music creates emotional engagement and memorability, it is a valuable, and often overlooked, educational tool. It can influence the entire pace, mood and energy level of the learning experience. And art can be used to facilitate self-understanding, emotional involvement and the application of knowledge to real life situations. </TD>

<BR>The theory of multiple intelligences and individual learning styles are an integral part of accelerated learning. IAL subscribes to Howard Gardner's perspective. . ."to respect the many differences among people, the multiple variations in the ways that they learn, the several modes by which they can be assessed, and the almost infinite number of ways in which they can leave a mark on the world."&nbsp; </TD>

<BR>What is not spoken may often be conveyed by body language, attitude, choice of words and thinly veiled expectations.
