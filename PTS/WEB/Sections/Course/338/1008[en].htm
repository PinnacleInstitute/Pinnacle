<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>You may have excellent products or services to offer, and the steps outlined in this workshop can help you sell more of them online; but the approach I recommend involves you taking center stage, not the product, service, or business itself. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Before you get the wrong idea, personal branding has nothing to do with bragging or being self-centered.

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>As you can see, the reasons people brand themselves are many and varied. If you're an artist, branding will help you connect your name with your technique and attract more fans (and more paying customers). If you're a Web designer, branding allows you to mix your attitude and distinct perspective with your technical skills so more people hire you. If you're a writer, branding paves the way to reaching a loyal readership without having to kiss the ... er, feet of a major publisher. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Not everyone has the same end-goals in mind; but there's one aspect that is consistent for everyone who successfully brands himself or herself online: interweaving an individual's name and personality directly with the product, service, or idea being promoted. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>More Branding Benefits </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Using the online branding tactics in this course, you'll be in control of determining who you are and how you want to be portrayed to your potential customers and fans. You'll decide what specific messages are sent out into the world and through what avenues those messages will travel. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>The key to establishing a personal brand identity in the cyber world is focusing on who you are and what you stand for and then getting the word out through a variety of Internet channels that are frequented by the people most likely to be interested in your message. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>As people start seeing your name and the benefit you offer, an impression begins to form. At first, ten people will be attracted to you and what you do ... then 50, and then 100. Before you know it, thousands of people will not only know who you are, but will come to view you as the resource of choice on your particular subject. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>As your circle of online influence grows, a multiplying effect takes place and your notoriety suddenly starts growing in bursts. A critical mass occurs, and before long, you find yourself in the enviable position of being an online celebrity of sorts - or at least a well-known expert among people who are immersed in the topic, craft, industry, or idea you represent. </FONT>
