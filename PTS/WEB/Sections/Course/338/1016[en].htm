<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While you're mulling over the three types of brand names discussed in Lesson 8, you must also consider how that name will work in tandem with a domain name - a particular Web site address that you register and own for as long as you want it. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>I cover the specifics of how to register a domain name and set up your own Web site in Chapter 5 of "Poor Richard's Branding Yourself Online." But for the purposes of the current lesson, we discuss the importance of choosing a domain name that compliments your brand name. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>If a friend tells you about a great new Web site or if you read about a site you can't wait to visit, what happens the next time you sit down at your computer? You type in the Web address, the same way your fans will when they start hearing and reading about you. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Therefore, your domain name should have the following two qualities: </FONT>
<UL type=disc>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l12 level1 lfo4"><DIV align=justify><FONT size=3>It should be easy for people to hear and know immediately how to spell. </FONT></DIV>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l12 level1 lfo4"><DIV align=justify><FONT size=3>It should be easy for people to remember after seeing it in print or on a computer screen. </FONT></DIV>
</UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Those qualities may seem simple, but they're not. Australian Charles Cave has an excellent, highly regarded site devoted to creative thinking skills called Creativity Web. The site's only drawback is its Web address: </FONT><A href="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~caveman/Creative/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>ozemail.com.au/~caveman/Creative/</FONT></A><FONT size=3>. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>No matter how much someone encouraged you to visit his site, what are the odds you'd remember (or even accurately write down) the full URL? Sure, you could probably remember "Creativity Web" and enter those words at a search engine and most likely find it; but why put your prospective fans through so much work? </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Make your domain simple, easy to remember, and simple enough to type accurately into a Web browser. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Is Your Favorite Name Available? </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>If you're wondering whether the domain name you have in mind is available, surf to </FONT><A href="http://networksolutions.com/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>Network Solutions</FONT></A><FONT size=3>. Enter the name you're considering and the site will let you know immediately whether the name is available as a .com, .net, or .org. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Here are two types of domain names to consider: </FONT>
<OL type=1>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo5"><DIV align=justify><FONT size=3>Your exact name or business name </FONT></DIV>
</OL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align=justify><FONT size=3>If your name is Carla Hall, the ideal Web address for you would be </FONT><A href="http://www.carlahall.com/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>carlahall.com</FONT></A><FONT size=3>. In fact, that was the domain name registered by singer-songwriter Carla Hall to promote her career. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align=justify><FONT size=3>My music-marketing newsletter is called The Buzz Factor. It's an ideal phrase to describe the promotional "buzz" I help musicians create over their music. Therefore, I registered </FONT><A href="http://www.thebuzzfactor.com/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>thebuzzfactor.com</FONT></A><FONT size=3>. My readers are already familiar with the term, so it was easy for them to remember my Web site address and find me. </FONT>
<OL type=1 start=2>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo5"><DIV align=justify><FONT size=3>Your slightly altered name or business name </FONT></DIV>
</OL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align=justify><FONT size=3>You may find that the domain name you want is already registered, or perhaps the brand name you've chosen doesn't lend itself to being a memorable Web address. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align=justify><FONT size=3>For instance, even though David and Tom Gardner have registered </FONT><A href="http://www.motleyfool.com/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>motleyfool.com</FONT></A><FONT size=3>, the URL they aggressively promote is the shorter </FONT><A href="http://www.fool.com/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>fool.com</FONT></A><FONT size=3>. There are just too many ways to misspell "motley" to rely on motleyfool alone. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" align=justify><FONT size=3>When I first looked into registering my name, I found that http://www.bobbaker.com/ was already being used by a Chevrolet dealer. However, </FONT><A href="http://www.bob-baker.com/"><FONT color=#333366 size=3>bob-baker.com</FONT></A><FONT size=3> (with a hyphen separating the first and last name) was available, so I grabbed it. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You should also think about the way that brand names stick in people's minds before making final brand and domain name decisions. One mistake Internet entrepreneurs make is choosing a generic name that reflects the entire category, such as QualityLandscaper.com. The problem is that all people who specialize in this field promote themselves as quality landscapers. Nothing about that name stands out and triggers a distinct mental association. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>Look at some of the more established Internet brands. The most recognized search directory isn't SearchDirectory.com; it's Yahoo.com. The most popular online bookstore isn't OnlineBookstore.com; it's Amazon.com. The most established job site isn't BigJobSite.com; it's Monster.com. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>There's no denying these sites have used advertising and publicity to etch their brand names into the public consciousness, but their wise choice of brand names did half of the marketing work. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" align=justify><FONT size=3>What do Yahoo, Amazon, and Monster have in common? They are simple, familiar words that are applied out of context to an online presence. It appears to defy logic; but using an obvious category reference in a name usually doesn't work as well as a name that's simple, clever, and unexpected. </FONT>
<P align=justify><FONT size=3>Here's the bottom line: Use your own name as a first choice; but if you must use a separate company name, stay away from generic phrases.</FONT>
