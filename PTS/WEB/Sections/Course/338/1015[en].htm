That observation sums up the heart of this lesson. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /></FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT size=3>To have the best chance of success online, you need to give potential customers and fans a name to remember -- one they can use to find you with ease. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT size=3>There are two types of names you must choose before embarking on your branding campaign: </FONT>

<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l4 level1 lfo11"><FONT size=3>Your domain name (Web address) </FONT>
</UL>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT size=3>Let's examine each one, starting with the name you use to promote yourself. Remember, on the Internet there are no tangible landmarks to help people remember where to find you. In the physical world, if you have a favorite Chinese restaurant, you don't have to know the name of the place to get to it. As long as you know the restaurant is located at the corner of Main Street and Fifth Avenue, you'll always be able to find it. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT size=3>On the Internet, though, the name is everything. If you don't recall the name of the person, business, or Web address, you'll have a tough time tracking it down. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><FONT size=3>Here are three options you have when choosing a brand name: </FONT>

<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l13 level1 lfo12"><FONT size=3>Use your real name </FONT>
</OL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>This is the most direct approach. If you're sold on the underlying premise of this workshop, it's a no-brainer to make your name the brand name. For example, one high-profile fashion company isn't called Cool Clothes Inc.; it's calling Tommy Hilfiger. One popular TV program isn't titled "The Late-Afternoon Inspiration Hour Geared Primarily to Women"; it's called "Oprah." </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>The best way to establish yourself as an expert or to be widely recognized in your field is to use your real name as your brand name. </FONT>
<OL type=1 start=2>
<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l13 level1 lfo12"><FONT size=3>Use a stage name </FONT>
</OL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>Perhaps you have tons of personality, a pleasing visual appeal, and Internet techno savvy out the wazoo. The only thing holding you back is a user-unfriendly name like Maude Cromwinkle-Swartz or Archibald K. Schraumboltenhofer. Fair enough. Even I'll admit that tongue-twisting names can pose problems for online brand-builders. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>If that's your situation, consider altering your name and using a cyberstage name instead. Film legend Kirk Douglas might have had a tough time gaining recognition if he had stuck with his real name, Isadore Demsky. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>The same principle applies to names that might confuse people or trigger unwanted associations. For instance, actor Albert Brooks decided not to use his real name, Albert Einstein, for good reason. </FONT>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>Also, if you're going to use an assumed name, make sure it stands out. For example, have you ever heard of Eileen Twain? Probably not, but I'll bet you've heard of country music superstar Shania Twain, who successfully uses the unique stage name she chose for herself. </FONT>

<LI class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; tab-stops: list .5in; mso-list: l13 level1 lfo12"><FONT size=3>Use a company name </FONT>
</OL>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in"><FONT size=3>This is listed as your third option for a good reason: It's the least attractive of the three. Sure, many company brand names have made enormous waves on the Internet (America Online, Netscape, Napster, Amazon, etc.), which might cause you to consider coming up with a cool business moniker of your own. </FONT>Brothers David and Tom Gardner did that when they created The Motley Fool, a series of books and a Web site (http://www.fool.com/) that cover personal finance and investing. Using a company name is an option to consider; but your personal branding goals will be met more forcefully if you use a human name instead of the name of an intangible business entity.
