<P><BLOCKQUOTE><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0><A href="http://www.pinnacleti.com/" target=_blank>All of us should insist on being treated fairly</A>; we have to stand up for our rights without violating the rights of others. This means tactfully, justly, and effectively expressing our preferences, needs, opinions and feelings. Psychologist call that being "assertive," as distinguished from being unassertive (weak, passive, compliant, self-sacrificing) or aggressive (self-centered, inconsiderate, hostile, arrogantly demanding). As mentioned in chapter 8, the Women's Movement since the 1960's has been a powerful influence on millions of women: women have gotten better career opportunities, more rights to control their bodies, more help from husbands with child care and housework, and so on. These changes happened because women assertively stood up for their rights. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Because some people want to be "nice" and "not cause trouble," they "suffer in silence," "turn the other cheek," and assume nothing can be done to change their situation or "it is our cross to bear." The rest of us appreciate pleasant, accommodating people but whenever a "nice" person permits a greedy, dominant person to take advantage of him/her, the passive person is not only cheating him/herself but also reinforcing unfair, self-centered behavior in the aggressive person. That's how chauvinists are created. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Assertiveness is an antidote to fear, shyness, passivity, and even anger, so there is an astonishingly wide range of situations in which this training is appropriate. Factor analysis of several assertiveness scales (Schimmel, 1976) has suggested several kinds of behavior are involved. </FONT>
