<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Start with the easier, less stressful situations. Build some confidence. Make adjustments in your approach as needed. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Look for or devise ways of sharpening your assertiveness skills. Examples: Ask a friend to lend you a piece of clothing, a record album, or a book. Ask a stranger for directions, change for a dollar, or a pen or pencil. Ask a store manager to reduce the price of a soiled or slightly damaged article, to demonstrate a product, or exchange a purchase. Ask an instructor to help you understand a point, find extra reading, or go over items you missed on an exam. Practice speaking and making small talk, give compliments to friends and strangers, call up a city official when you see something unreasonable or inefficient, praise others when they have done well, tell friends or co-workers experiences you have had, and on and on. Keep a diary of your interactions. </FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Perhaps as little as a couple hours is needed, if you only have one or two situations in which you want to improve. If you are generally submissive, count on several hours for understanding, preparing, practicing and actually changing. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><FONT color=#cc5533>Common problems</FONT></B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Several problems have been mentioned above. Some people refuse to admit their submissiveness. Some are afraid to change. If you do change, some of your friends, relatives and/or co-workers may have difficulty accepting such a basic change in personality. Tell them why you want to be different; most will support you. If you ask for changes in others, you are likely to be resisted and maybe resented. Appeal to their sense of fairness. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>It is not uncommon for a formerly passive person to be so successful in changing that he/she becomes overly demanding. Perhaps the new found power goes to his/her head and he/she becomes aggressive and obnoxious. If you can remain just as sensitive to other people's rights as you are to your own, this isn't likely to happen. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><FONT color=#cc5533>Effectiveness, advantages and dangers</FONT></B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Assertiveness training has been used with shy, anxious, depressed, stressed, aggressive and other kinds of persons. There is "relatively convincing evidence" that assertiveness training is effective, i.e. it changes the trainee's behavior, at least in situations similar to those used for practice during the training sessions (Rimm &amp; Masters, 1974). It is not certain that assertiveness generalizes to "novel" situations, i.e. ones you haven't practiced or thought about. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Furthermore, considering the hundreds of articles and the 15-20 major books proclaiming the usefulness of assertiveness training, it may surprise you that there is very little scientific evidence that the trainees' marriage, work place, friendships and family relations are improved after learning to be assertive in a seminar (Eisler, Miller, Hersen &amp; Alford, 1974). Amazing, isn't it? In fact, there are hints that an untrained spouse of a trainee may become <I>less assertive</I> , more socially anxious, and less sure of his/her social skills (Kolotkin &amp; Wielkiewicz, 1982). So it may be wise for married couples or friends or work groups to take assertiveness training together, emphasizing cooperation and congeniality. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>All the research observations referred to in the last paragraph apply to formal training provided by graduate students or professionals. There is almost no data about the effectiveness of reading about assertiveness on one's own and practicing with a friend. Certainly the impact of self-taught assertiveness on friends and loved ones is unknown; it sounds convincing that a pleasant, considerate, fair but assertive person would make a good partner, but perhaps what seems considerate and fair to one person may seem aggressive to another person. As we change, we should be alert to the possibility of making life worse for others. Much research is needed. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>Alberti and Emmons (1978, 1986), who were the original writers in this area, believe that assertive training works only with people who are not entirely passive or continuously aggressive. For the extremes, they recommend psychotherapy. Likewise, if the people around you will react hostilely to your being graciously assertive, perhaps you should see a lawyer. Refusing to make the coffee may result in losing your job or a promotion, so move cautiously. It may be wise to postpone a confrontation until the time is right. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><IMG height=6 alt=" " src="http://mentalhelp.net/images/root/psyhelp/p.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0>There is no known danger, although some research has suggested that certain men believe that sexual aggression, such as kissing, fondling, and even intercourse, is a little more justified, if the women has initiated the date, gone to the male's apartment, let the man pay for everything, etc. A female being assertive or unassertive is not going to cause a rape (that is a male sickness), but all of our behavior has implications in other people's minds- and some of those minds are chauvinistic, weird, inconsiderate, etc. In general, you are surely much safer being assertively honest, rather than overly shy, needy and dependent, afraid of hurting someone's feelings, uncertain of what to say, and so on.</FONT>
