In an empowered organization, people should not expect to be told what to do, but they should know what to do. The primary role of management is "to support and stimulate their people, co-operate to overcome cross functional barriers, and work to eliminate fear within their own team" (Hand, 1994: 25). </FONT>

Therefore, it is logical that most of the resistance to empowerment comes from the middle management (Keighley, 1993: 7). Keighley argues that this resistance to change can be reduced by setting, measuring and evaluating performance together with the team (1993: 8). Likewise, Hand argues that supervisors and managers should be trained in order to cope with organizational change (1994: 24). </FONT>

Dobbs (1993: 55) argues that work-teams are unable to see the connection between process improvements and the overall strategy and profitability of the firm.</FONT>
