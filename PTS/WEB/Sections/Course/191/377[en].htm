<P>Did you take your Quiz? </P>
<P>If not, please go to the Quiz part and answer all questions there. </P>
<P>Done with the Quiz? </P>
<P>Fine! Let's go through the questions to see what they say about your self image. </P>
<UL>
<LI>If you cannot stand with ease for any period of time with your back, feet, head against the wall, then your spine is out of balance and harmony. It is either too stiff or bent. Your personal energy flow is being blocked and your breathing is most probably affected in some way. Your self confidence is most probably constraint in some way. </LI>
<LI>What about touching the wall with your legs straight against it? If you cannot put your palms flat on the wall with your feet touching the wall and legs straight on the floor, then again you lack flexibility. Your back and legs. But the same can be said regarding your mind. Don't you lack flexibility in some issues? How this lack of flexibility influence your self image? </LI>
<LI>Ok. How was the bridge? Can you do it? Actually it is more important to have strong muscles along the spine to help you maintain balance. Even if your other muscles are strong, but that small muscles along the spine are weak, you are prone to accidents. Also your breathing will be affected in a negative way, creating a loss of confidence in surprising moments. </LI>
<LI>How does your body react to meals? Do you feel heavy, or maybe you feel sleepy? What does it mean? It means that you either eat too much, or some ingridients do not compliment your body and should be eliminated from your menu. It also means that your meals put your body into a state of stress and force it to fight with the toxins. It weakens your immune system and slows down your performance. Ok. Are you by any means overweight? Is your diet right for you? Do you feel energized after every meal or do you feel as if after taking some antidepressants? With a full and heavy stomack isn't it nice to feel fulfilled? If this is the case, what about your self image? Can you write down all the "expectations" you, your family, the society put onto you and all expectations you have towards them? Or are you underweight? Again do we have any "expectations" here? The whole world is crazy and doesn't want to meet your expectations? Or is it something different? </LI>
<LI>What about your breathing? How long can you hold your breath? If less than 45 seconds, then you are hyperventilating. And hyperventilation is the root of many health and mind problems. One of them might be an alergy. Such problems influence strongly self image and here is a good time to see how your body influences your health and state of mind. </LI>
<LI>How do you react in situations where your expectations are not met? Are you fighting with the world around you looking for the person who failed and pointing out to that person that she or he is a failure? Do you think that you are OK, but others are not OK? Or maybe you tend to blame yourself for any mishappenings? All others are OK but you, poor soul, not. </LI>
<LI>Do you notice and understand the energy that is flowing within you? Can you differentiate between the feeling of fear and a strong energy flow, like for example while in the woods? For a long time I was misunderstanding an energy flow for a sense of fear. That stopped me from many exercises only because my self image was not strong enough to overcome that "fear". </LI>
<LI>Can you feel the energy field between your hands? This is a very important step on the way of understanding your personal energy and its connections with your inner state. Have a few silent moments to examine each point and take notes of answers to the above questions and ideas. Combine it into the following categories: </LI>
