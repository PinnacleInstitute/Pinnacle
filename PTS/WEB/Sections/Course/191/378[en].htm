<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P dir=ltr>Now is the time to find "Ideal WaKi". What is it? </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P dir=ltr><EM>It is a process of finding in the above, highly energizing, events common elements - the internal harmony which is being created during each successful situation.</EM> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Read through your notes on Body/Mind/Spirit situations that you consider to be higly successful.&nbsp;In each of the situation, there was a moment that reached your deep inner world.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Please sit down in a quiet place&nbsp; </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>First read through your notes and try to find common elements. </DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV>Write down all that you notice</DIV></LI></UL>
<P>Next comes the time for a dialog with your inner part. </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<DIV>
<DIV>Sit down comfortably and in your imagination go back to the events. </DIV></DIV></LI>
<LI>
<DIV>
<DIV>Ask your unconscious to show you the elements that you did not notice during your conscious work. </DIV></DIV></LI>
<LI>Recall as many details as possible and focus on your inside. </LI>
<LI>Note which part of you is resonating in those events, which part or what inside you is active during those events. </LI>
<LI>Please write immediately anything that will come to your mind. It doesn't need to be in clean, clear writing. Write as you feel. </LI></UL>
<P>The above instruction can be very vague, or frustrating for some beginners. Some may say, I don't have any situation, where I were 100% satisfied. Others will think of a nice situation, but will not be sure if they are right in what they do. Others will not understand what they are supposed to do. This is a natural process. Our unconscious does not like change. The unconscious loves situations IT is used to. </P>
<P>Therefore, not understanding a task, not being sure if they way we do things is right is a standard reaction. </P>
<P>If you do not understand what to do, first of all do not blame yourself. Simply say to yourself: </P>
<P><EM>"Dear unconscious! Thank you for protecting me and keeping me on the safe side. Grateful as I am, I want to inform you that today is the starting day of our search for even greater safety. I need your help to develop the kind of safety where both of us: I and You will enjoy total Peace of mind. Please help me to discover the moments where both of us enjoyed the ultimate safety and Peace of mind. Please assist me in making sure that the changes we are about to perform are for the greatest benefit for You and Me and for the greatest good of all that will be involved in any way during the process." </EM></P>
<P>For those who do not know what to do, let's have an example. </P>
<P>1) Body: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P>For me an ideal situation where my body functioned perfectly was a fight simulation for an exam in a Japanese martial art Shorinji Kenpo. </P>
<P>I was very excited to perform in front of a big audience, but at the same time I was incredibly focused on a spot within my belly. A slight tension applied to that spot allowed me to feel confident, fast and strong. In a moment the audience disapeared into the background. I still was aware of them, in the sense of feeling the distance to them, but my focus was pointed to my partner. I could feel a strong electrical current running through my body. My breathing became very regular and rather slow. I could sense the slightest movement of my partner, I could enjoy the stilness within my body. All sounds disapeared into the background and there was a little tensed silence. </P>
<P>We started our performance. </P>
<P>Our moves, even though quite fast, seemed to be in slow motion. Therefore, there was no problem with timing, because each move was so clearly visible that even when my partner made a mistake, I had no problem with reacting in a correct way and keeping the flow of our performance. </P>
<P>There was an additional aspect that I didn't notice during the presentation. I learned about it later on and understood it years later. In a special moment where my partner caught my sleeve, I countered, made a slight "atemi" that is a distracting strike to the ribs and then a spectacular throw in the air. </P>
<P>What I din't realized at that time, was the fact that even though I didn't apply much force to the strike into my partner's ribs, I was intensly focused. That focus added energy to my strike and broke my partner's rib. At first I blamed myself for not being carefull enough. Today I understand what I didn't know at that time. I didn't know that there are two different kinds of strike: one with the body and another with the mind. At that time unaware of the consequences, along with a hand stroke, I applied a strong stroke with my focused mind. When we finished, we got a big applauze and I could feel a strong satisfaction and pride to be able to perform like this. This was reinforced by winning the first prize in competition. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
