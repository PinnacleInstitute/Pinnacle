<P><B> Course Goals </B> 
<P>The Photoshop for Photographers courses&nbsp;will help you make the most of your Photography within Photoshop. 
<P>In Course 2, we're going to learn how to make a very effective - and creatively useful - aged newspaper effect with your own digital photos. That same effect is our meat for creating a custom action all our own.
<P>More than the newspaper action which we'll end with as our final project, you'll be familiarizing yourself with RGB and CMYK color issues, Running and Loading Actions within Photoshop, and tools native to Photoshop. Written in a format which is suitable for the beginning Photoshop user, there are more than enough techniques and concepts for the intermediate and advanced user as well. Your photography skills do not&nbsp;count in successful completion of this course. 
<P><B> Course Materials </B> 
<P>The only materials you need to provide on your own is a collection of 7-10 digital photos that you want to work with. All other materials will be provided. 
<P><B> Grading Policy </B> 
<P>Grades are figured evenly between Quiz Results&nbsp;and Work Achieved.
