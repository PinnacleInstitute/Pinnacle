By following the example of Jesus Christ who came to earth not to storm our hearts but to woo and draw us to Himself for one purpose- to win our uncompelled love. If we truely make Him our model we will enter our child's world and lay aside our adult power- we will look past behavior to the heart and parent from the inside out instead of just the outside in. We wil become instruments of the Holy Spirit in the process of turning the desire of your child's heart to God. The concept of Romancing Your Child's Heart builds on the belief that just as romance is central to the Gospel of Jesus Christ romance is also central to biblical parenting. Romancing Your Child's Heart is not a formula for parenting, but it is a way of life. And it all begins with the understanding that God is the first and true Romancer of every heart.
