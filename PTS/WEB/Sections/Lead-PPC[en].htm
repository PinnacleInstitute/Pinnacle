<BR><FONT size=4><B>PPC Tip #3 - Group Your Keywords</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>This is especially important for&nbsp;Google.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Now that you have done your keyword research and found several words and phrases closely related to your product or business.&nbsp; You will need to group them.&nbsp; This is extremely important when using Google's PPC.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Your promoting "Widgets".&nbsp; So you have done your research and come up with the following keyword list.</FONT><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=3>Blue Widgets 
<BR>Buy Widgets 
<BR>Order Widgets 
<BR>Red Widgets 
<BR>Green Widgets 
<BR>Buy Blue Widgets 
<BR>Green Widgets for sale</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>This is a good start.&nbsp; Now we need to put these keywords into similar groups.&nbsp; Here is how to organize these keywords.</FONT><BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<P><FONT size=3>Blue Widgets 
<BR>Buy Blue Widgets</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Buy Widgets 
<BR>Order Widgets</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Red Widgets</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Green Widgets 
<BR>Green widgets for sale</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=3>By keeping your keywords and phrases in small select groups you will be better able to target your Ad for the specific keywords your using.&nbsp; You couldn't possibly come up with one Ad that would cover all of your widgets.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Heres Why...</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Google doesn't just reward the highest bidder. They reward the Smartest Bidders. Google is all about relevancy.&nbsp;If you're using the keyword phrase "Buy Blue Widgets" and your ad has the title "Buy Blue Widgets"</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Buy Blue Widgets will be showcased in BOLD because it matched the searchers query exactly. This also applies to your ad itself. Any keywords in the ad or subject will also be shown in BOLD.&nbsp; This one tactic alone will increase your Click Through Rate (CTR) by a very noticeable amount. By keeping your keywords in small groups you can write your ads accordingly so that you can maximize the amount of BOLD text in your ad.</FONT>

These are your real competitors and the ones you should be watching. All of the other ads you can&nbsp;basically ignore because&nbsp;their CTR will be much lower and you&nbsp;can get better positioning for less money by writing your ads smarter.&nbsp; Y</FONT><FONT size=3>our ad is displayed in BOLD and theirs is not.&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>By reading this article in full you will definitely be way ahead of most of the people using PPC advertising.&nbsp; You will be able to spot the Good from the Bad.</FONT> 
<P align=center><FONT size=3><FONT size=4><B>PPC Tip #5 - Keyword Tags are Extremely Important</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Another important factor when writing your Google ads are the different keyword tags you can use. You can use&nbsp;the following two.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>These are [ ] and " "</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Some people will ask why they get so many impressions but no clicks...&nbsp;1000's of impressions and 1 or no clicks.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>This is usually due to a very broad keyword with no tags.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>For example.&nbsp;If you type in the keyword Blue Widgets...</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Google will show your ad for anyone who searches "Blue" or "Widgets".&nbsp; They don't even have to be in that order.&nbsp; There are thousands of different things those users may be looking for and it's probably not "Blue Widgets".&nbsp; They could have been searching for Blue Shoes and your ad would still show because of the keyword "Blue".&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence so many impressions and no clicks.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can change this by adding [Blue Widgets] adding the [ before and ] after changes your keyword to an "Exact Match" now your ad will only be shown when someone types "Blue Widgets"</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The " " tags will match a phrase. So for example I have the keyword "Buy Blue Widgets Online" using the phrase tags will show my ad when a searcher uses all of those words in any combination.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>The result will be less impressions and more targeted clicks. You have just effectively micro-targeted your keyword and ad.</FONT> 
<P align=center><FONT size=4><B>PPC Tip # 6 -&nbsp;Your Daily Budget</B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>This is especially important for&nbsp;Google.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>DON'T BE CHEAP.&nbsp; Because Google will allow you to control your daily budget many people make the mistake of being way to cheap.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>If you put your daily budget to $1.00 and your bidding say .10 on each click. Google only needs to get you 10 clicks and your done, So they will only be showing your ad for a portion of the searches being done.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>If you increase that to $50 or even $100, Google will now be showing your ad much more frequently in an attempt to meet your much higher daily budget.&nbsp; And the secret is... They can't do it! I have never had a campaign stretch more then $3 - 5 dollars in a day. And that was using a daily budget of $200+</FONT>
