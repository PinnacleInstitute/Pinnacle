<BR>The Pinnacle Project Collaboration System (PCS) is a project management tool designed to accomplish the following goals. 
<BR>
<BR>1.&nbsp;<B> Collaboration</B> :&nbsp; Enable a team of distributed individuals to work together on a shared project. 
<BR>2.&nbsp;<B> Accountability</B> : Track individual performance on assigned tasks. 
<BR>3.&nbsp;<B> Simplicity</B> : Provide an easy-to-use tool to centrally manage projects. 
<BR>
<BR>PCS provides total flexibility in defining the structure of any project from simple to complex. A project may consist of an unlimited number of sub-projects and each project or sub-project may have an unlimited number of tasks and sub-tasks. Collaboration is accomplished with an unlimited number of notes and attached documents at any level, and a discussion board for members to submit and reply to archived messages.

<BR>Before a company starts using the capabilities of PCS, it can setup a custom list of project types.&nbsp; The company administrator can access PCS after signing into Pinnacle by selecting the “Projects” link under the “Manage Business” caption on the navigation bar on the left hand side of the page. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Project Types 
<BR></B>Select the “Project Types” link in the upper right hand corner of the “Project Collaboration System” page. Existing project types are displayed in a list in sequence order. Click the name of the project type in the list to edit the existing project type. Some examples of project types may include; software, product, marketing, creative, etc. 
<BR>
<BR><B>Enable Member Access 
<BR></B>Access to the Project Collaboration System must be enabled for each individual member.&nbsp; The Pinnacle Account Executive can specify the default project access for newly added members.&nbsp; The company administrator can specify each individual member’s project access on the member’s information page.&nbsp; A member’s project access can be set to all projects that they are assigned to, or may be set to all projects with a security level equal to or less than their membership security level.&nbsp; Security level access is convenient for management to view all projects without being added as a member of the projects.
