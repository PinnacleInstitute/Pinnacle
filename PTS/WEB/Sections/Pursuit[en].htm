<P align=center><FONT color=#993300 size=5>The Pursuit of Learning</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Train yourselves to make a contribution to the society in which you&nbsp;live. There is an essence of the divine in the improvement of the mind. ‘The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.’&nbsp; ‘Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection.’&nbsp;Education is an investment that never ceases to pay dividends of one kind or another” </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>We seek learning by studying the accumulated wisdom of various disciplines and by using the powers of reasoning placed in us by our Creator. We should also seek learning by faith in God, the giver of revelation.&nbsp; Seekers who have paid the price in perspiration have been magnified by inspiration. The acquisition of knowledge by revelation is an extra bonus to seekers in the sciences and the arts, but it is the fundamental method for those who seek to know God and the doctrines of his gospel. In this area of knowledge, scholarship and reason are insufficient. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>We must be trained to clarify minds, heal broken hearts, and create homes where sunshine will make an environment in which mental and spiritual health may be nurtured.&nbsp;Our schooling must not only teach us how to bridge the Niagara River gorge, or the Golden Gate, but must teach us how to bridge the deep gaps of misunderstanding and hate and discord in the world. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Each of us comes to earth with a specific trait we inherited from our heavenly parents, a natural thirst to continually learn and progress. Our Heavenly Father is waiting to bless us with knowledge. “As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of his children. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Whatever our current situations, we can seek experiences that will increase our knowledge and enlighten our understanding. We can each make our home a house of learning, surrounding ourselves with the scriptures, good books, uplifting music, and healthful activities. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Some of us may choose formal educational routes of learning. Some will make contributions in science, medicine, or business. Some of us will create art. But all of us have the potential to have a righteous influence in the lives of our families, friends, or students. </FONT>
