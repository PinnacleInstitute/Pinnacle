<BR>The SMS page provides links to all SMS functionality and the ability to search for prospects by prospect name, contact name, prospect #, email address and suspect date.&nbsp; The contact name is searched by last name and first name (i.e. Smith, Bob).&nbsp; A partial search word will return all matches that start with the search entry, except for prospect name, which returns all matches that contain the search entry anywhere in the name.&nbsp; The search list results are sorted by the search field selected in the first combo box.&nbsp; The prospect search can also be filtered by one of the predefined statuses by selecting a status option from the second combo box.&nbsp; This is convenient for members to easily view their current suspects. </FONT>
