<P><FONT size=3>You can search for precise or fuzzy (less precise) matches to single words and phrases or the proximity of words within a certain distance of one another. You can search for: </FONT>
<P><I><FONT size=3>A word or phrase. </FONT></I>
<P><I><FONT size=3>The prefix of a word or phrase. </FONT></I>
<P><I><FONT size=3>A word near another word. </FONT></I>
<P><I><FONT size=3>A similar word inflectionally generated from another (for example, the word drive is the inflectional stem of drives, drove, driving, and driven).

<P><FONT size=3><B><FONT size=4>Simple Searches</FONT></B></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can search for an exact word (one or more characters without spaces or punctuation) or a phrase (one or more consecutive words separated by spaces). Phrases should be enclosed in double quotation marks (""). Words in a phrase must appear in the same order as they appear in the source information. The search for characters in the word or phrase is case insensitive. Insignificant words (such as a, and, or the) are not included in the search. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Punctuation is ignored. Therefore, "computer failure" matches "Where is my computer? Failure to find it would be expensive." </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Examples: bottle, "water bottle", "blue berry", blueberry, "Microsoft Word"</FONT>

<P><FONT size=3><FONT size=4><B>Prefix (Wildcard) Searches</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can search for a match of words or phrases beginning with the specified text. Enclose a term in double quotation marks ("") and add an asterisk (*) before the ending quotation mark, so that all text starting with the simple term specified before the asterisk is matched. For example, "text*". The asterisk matches zero, one, or more characters (of the root word or words in the word or phrase). If the text and asterisk are not delimited by double quotation marks, as in text*, the search considers the asterisk as a character and will search for exact matches to text*. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>When the term is a phrase, each word contained in the phrase is considered to be a separate prefix. Therefore, a query specifying a prefix term of "local wine *" matches anything with the text of "local winery", "locally wined and dined", and so on. </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><B><I><FONT color=#0000ff>Examples: "step*", "step car *"</FONT></I></B></FONT> 
<P>
<BR><FONT size=4><B>Similar Term Searches </B></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>You can search for a match of words when the specified simple terms include variants of the original word for which to search. These include the plural and singular, as well as the gender and neutral forms of nouns, verbs, and adjectives, and the various tenses of verbs. A single word search will automatically search for similar words.&nbsp; Multiple words that are not in quotes and do not contain the keywords "and", "or", or "near" will also search for similar words to all specified words.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Examples: drive, watch, try, say</FONT></B></I></FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3><FONT size=4><B>Proximity Searches</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can search for a match of words or phrases that must be close to one another. As the words appear closer together, the better the match. The NEAR keyword indicates that the word or phrase on the left side of the NEAR keyword should be approximately close to the word or phrase on the right side of the NEAR keyword. Multiple proximity terms can be chained, for example: a NEAR b NEAR c, This means that word or phrase a should be near word or phrase b, which should be near word or phrase c. </FONT>

<BR><FONT size=3><FONT size=4><B>AND | AND NOT | OR</B></FONT></FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You can specify a logical operation between two search conditions. When your search contains parenthesized groups, these parenthesized groups are evaluated first. After evaluating parenthesized groups, these rules apply when using these logical operators with search conditions: </FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>NOT is applied before AND. </I></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>NOT can only occur after AND, as in AND NOT. OR NOT is not allowed. NOT cannot be specified before the first term (for example, NOT "Blue Berry". </I></FONT>
<P><FONT size=3><I>AND is applied before OR. </I></FONT>
<P><FONT color=#000099 size=3><I><B><FONT color=#0000ff>Examples: Apple AND Orange, Apple OR Orange, Apple OR "Blue Berry", "sea*" OR "bread*"</FONT></B></I></FONT>
