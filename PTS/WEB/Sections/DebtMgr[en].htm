         Manager will assist you in eliminating your debt by applying accelerated
        payments to your
        debts until you are completely debt free.&nbsp; The strategy typically
        starts with an extra amount to start applying to the debt with the
        highest interest rate.&nbsp; While making your normal monthly debt
        payments, as the debt's are paid off, you will continue to pay the same
        monthly amounts applied to the remaining debts until you are completely
        debt free. A savings account may also accumulate funds for a rainy day.</font>
