<P align=left><FONT size=3>A lead program could be considered any website that allows your visitor to enter their contact information to request more information on your product or opportunity.</FONT>
<P><FONT size=3>Rather than have your visitor rifle through your entire company website reading through pages and pages of information a lead program is designed to be simple yet deliver a very direct message about your business opportunity, products or services.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>When you put forth too much information to a website visitor in the wrong fashion you will scare them off the moment they arrive at your site. You are simply providing them with too much information on your site when they haven't even really asked to even see it yet.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>When you tease your visitors with a lead program you give them one course of action to take.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>If they are interested in your product or opportunity they will surely submit their information through the lead program.&nbsp; When this occurs the prospects details will be delivered to you in real-time.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You will have a fresh, qualified lead for your specific program.&nbsp; At the same time the prospect can&nbsp;be re-directed to a website of your choosing.&nbsp; You can have them re-directed to either your company website, online presentation or thank you page.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You already possess their contact information so at this point in time it really doesn't matter where they go.&nbsp; You can follow up with them at your leisure.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>This is building your own personal list at it's finest.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Not only that but you will be collecting names and contact information from people who are actually interested in your specific offer.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>You cannot go out and buy leads like this, the only way to get them is to use a lead program and generate them yourself.</FONT> 
<P><FONT size=3>Why spend $100's or $1000's on leads when you could spend that same money on advertising your lead program and generating the best prospects money can buy for a price that any marketer could afford.</FONT>
